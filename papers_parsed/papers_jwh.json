[{"title": "LGBT Identity, Untreated Depression, and Unmet Need for Mental Health Services by Sexual Minority Women and Trans-Identified People", "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have found that transgender, lesbian, and bisexual people report poorer mental health relative to heterosexuals. However, available research provides little information about mental health service access among the highest need groups within these communities: bisexual women and transgender people. This study compared past year unmet need for mental health care and untreated depression between four groups: heterosexual cisgender (i.e., not transgender) women, cisgender lesbians, cisgender bisexual women, and transgender people. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional Internet survey. We used targeted sampling to recruit 704 sexual and gender minority people and heterosexual cisgendered adult women across Ontario, Canada. To ensure adequate representation of vulnerable groups, we oversampled racialized and low socioeconomic status (SES) women. Results: Trans participants were 2.4 times (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.6-3.8, p < 0.01) and bisexual people 1.8 times (95% CI = 1.1-2.9, p = 0.02) as likely to report an unmet need for mental healthcare as cisgender heterosexual women. Trans participants were also 1.6 times (95% CI = 1.0-27, p = 0.04) more likely to report untreated depression. These differences were not seen after adjustment for social context factors such as discrimination and social support. Conclusion: We conclude that there are higher rates of unmet need and untreated depression in trans and bisexual participants that are partly explained by differences in social factors, including experiences of discrimination, lower levels of social support, and systemic exclusion from healthcare. Our findings suggest that the mental health system in Ontario is not currently meeting the needs of many sexual and gender minority people.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T here is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that sexual minority people, including gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people, report poorer mental health outcomes relative to heterosexuals. [1][2][3] Gender minority (i.e., transgender) people are also at substantially increased risk for depression, 4,5 completed suicide, suicide attempts, and other forms of self-harm, 6,7 relative to rates reported for the general population. For example, a recent study of more than 400 transgender people from across the province of Ontario found that 61.2% of male-to-female spectrum transgender people and 66.4% of female-to-male-spectrum transgender people reported current depression. 4,5 In this same study, past year suicidal ideation was reported by 36% of transgender people, and past year suicide attempt by 10%. 8 Experiences of discrimination and social exclusion are important contributors to mental health disparities associated with minority sexual orientations and gender identities. [9][10][11][12][13] There are well-established differences in both prevalence of mental health problems and patterns of mental health service utilization between men and women in the general population. The prevalence of depression is between 1.5-and 3-fold higher among women than among men, 14,15 and women are more likely to seek mental health services than men. 16,17 The increased risk for depression among women appears to be amplified in the context of sexual minority status: data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS, combined years 2003 and indicate that lifetime mood disorder diagnoses are significantly more common among sexual minority women than among heterosexual women (11.4% in lesbians vs. 25.2% in bisexual women vs. 7.7% among heterosexual women). 18 These Canadian data are consistent with other international studies. For example, in a representative study of the Dutch population, lifetime prevalence of major depression among women with same-sex sexual partners was 44.2%, significantly higher than the rate of 20% reported among heterosexual women. 19 The few studies that have examined bisexual women independently of lesbian-identified women have found that bisexual women have the poorest mental health outcomes of all sexual orientation groups. [20][21][22] These data indicate that the burden of depression among sexual minority women is higher than the burden of depression among heterosexual women.\nConsidering the high rates of need, high rates of mental health service utilization would be anticipated for sexual minority women and transgender people. Indeed, available data suggest that sexual minority people, and particularly lesbians and gay men, are both more likely than heterosexuals to consult mental health professionals and to report barriers to mental health service access associated with their sexual orientation. 9,18,[23][24][25][26] For example, in an American study of 67 sexual minority people with severe and persistent mental illness, 21.7% of sexual minority women reported being dissatisfied with their mental health services; only 7.2% of heterosexual women reported dissatisfaction. 27 However, very little research has examined rates and predictors of mental health service access among bisexual women and transgender people (the highest need groups) in particular. The limited available research on bisexual people's mental health services experiences indicates that widely held social beliefs about bisexuality (such as the belief that bisexuals cannot be monogamous and that bisexuality is not a stable sexual identity) may both create mental distress for bisexual people, 28 and impact access to culturally competent services. 29 Transgender people who seek mental healthcare for reasons other than gender reassignment may also face barriers, including refusal of treatment, poor quality of care, inappropriate attribution of their mental health concerns to their gender identity, or refusal to address them by their preferred pronoun. [30][31][32][33] In summary, available research provides little information about mental health service access among the highest need groups within the sexual and gender minority communities: bisexual women and transgender people. A lack of access to inclusive mental health services may be a contributing factor in the elevated levels of depression, suicidality, and other mental health concerns among these populations. We aim to address this research gap by comparing past year unmet need for mental healthcare and untreated depression between four groups: heterosexual cisgender (i.e., not transgender) women, cisgender lesbians, cisgender bisexual women, and transgender people. We also examine variables associated with unmet need for mental healthcare and untreated depression in these groups.", "n_publication_ref": 39, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This article is based on data from a cross-sectional Internet survey that was implemented as part of a mixed methods community-based study.

To simplify the interpretation of the regression results, we created two binary variables that identified participants who endorsed having experienced at least three episodes of discrimination or at least three types of microaggressions either fairly or very often. We used these cutoffs because they have been significantly correlated with negative outcomes in previous research. 22,36 In collaboration with the community advisory committee, we derived a variable that identified individuals who reported a barrier to mental healthcare that was related to the concept of systemic exclusion. Our concept of systemic exclusion was informed by the literature on ''cultural safety,'' as it applies to the systemic exclusion of Indigenous people from the healthcare system. 44 Systemic exclusion was assigned the value ''1'' if participants had (1) reported an unmet need for mental healthcare AND (2) had endorsed any one of the following sentences: (a) ''[I was] afraid to ask for help or of what others would think,'' (b) ''[I] had a bad experience with a mental health professional in the past,'' (c) ''[I have] a lack of trust in the medical system,'' (d) ''[I] could not find a provider who was knowledgeable about issues of sexual orientation,'' (e) ''I could not find a provider who was knowledgeable about issues of gender identity,'' (f) ''I could not find a provider who was knowledgeable about racial, cultural, or ethnic issues that are important to me,'' (g) ''I could not find a provider who was knowledgeable about issues related to social class/income level that are important to me,'' (h) ''I could not find a provider who was knowledgeable about some other aspects of my identity(ies) that are important to me.''

Consequently, the recruitment was continued until we had achieved a minimum of 100 participants in each of the following subgroups:  8) not racialized, not low SES, not LGBT.

Finally, we used multivariable logistic regression to assess the independent effects of sexual orientation or gender identity on unmet need and untreated depression and to understand how potential confounding barriers influence the relationship between our main exposure variables and the outcomes. We analyzed four separate models for each outcome. For unmet need, our first model included only the sexual orientation and gender identity variable; our second model added sociodemographic variables (age, lower SES, and racialized identity); our third model added mental health need and use variables (12-month depression or anhedonia, and 12-month treatment for depression); and our fourth model added social context variables (discriminatory events, microaggression, events and social support). Systemic exclusion was not included for the unmet need analysis because this information was only available for those who had endorsed an unmet need. The analysis of untreated depression was limited to those participants who had endorsed an unmet need for mental healthcare. For this analysis, we ran the first two models as described above, a third model added the social context variables described above plus a systemic exclusion variable.

They also reported the lowest level of perceived social support. In contrast, women in the CIS-HET group reported the highest level of perceived social support, and the lowest rates of lifetime discriminatory events. Overall, 68.3% of the total sample reported an unmet need for mental healthcare in the past 12 months, and 33.1% of the sample reported a 12-month history of anhedonia or depression without any treatment.\nThe CIS-HET women in our study differed from a population-based sample of Canadian heterosexual women taken from the CCHS Cycle 2.1.

However, it is important to acknowledge that a diverse group of individuals were categorized as ''trans'' in this study. There may be important differences between trans women, trans men, and those who identify outside of binary genders (e.g., genderqueer) that are masked by the broad categorization used in this study. To address this concern, we examined differences between trans women (n = 86), trans men (n = 60), and other trans people (n = 46) in our study.

Psychiatric morbidity and social factors, including experiences of discrimination and low levels of social support, were independently associated with unmet need. We also found that a measure of systemic exclusion from healthcare was significantly associated with untreated depression among participants with unmet need. We conclude that there are higher rates of unmet need and untreated depression in trans and bisexual participants that are partly explained by differences in social factors, including experiences of discrimination, lower levels of social support, and systemic exclusion from healthcare. A primary strength of the study is the large sample size, which allowed for comparisons between groups within the LGBT acronym. In most other research on LGBT mental health, these groups are examined separately from one another, and our findings indicate that this approach may mask important differences between groups. In particular, our study indicates the importance of including TRANS participants in research of this nature, a group that is often excluded from analyses due to small sample sizes, and yet may experience the poorest access to mental health services. Our study is also strengthened by deliberate inclusion of participants with a broad spectrum of racialized identities, as well as a substantial proportion of participants of low socioeconomic status, thus extending our findings beyond the limited scope of most studies on LGBT mental health. Finally, our study is strengthened by use of standardized items to measure many of our outcome and predictor variables, allowing for comparison with other research in this field.\nThe primary limitation of this study is the convenience sampling design, although it is important to note that there are no population-based Canadian data sources that would enable  LGBT IDENTITY, UNTREATED DEPRESSION, AND UNMET NEED us to address our research questions (particularly since there are no population-based surveys in Canada currently that assess gender identity). The response rate for our survey limits the generalizability of our findings, although across disciplines, response rates for Internet-based surveys have been found to be lower than those for mail or other surveys. 48 For example, a meta-analysis of response rates in a total of 68 Internet surveys yielded a mean response rate of 39.6%. 49 In this particular study, we would anticipate that some of those individuals who logged on to the study home page did so without an intention to participate; for example, representatives of organizations determining whether or not they would promote the survey to their clients. It is also likely that individuals viewed the survey before determining that they were not eligible to participate. These types of ''views'' would artificially lower the minimal response rate. Using the IP address count as the denominator for calculating the response rate is imprecise; individual IP addresses could represent more than one individual (e.g., when a firewall is in place), or a single individual could be assigned more than one IP address (e.g., logging in from two different settings, or having a dynamic IP assigned by a service provider). These influences could erroneously raise or lower the estimated response rate. While our sample size was relatively large in comparison to existing studies, we may still have been limited in identifying some important differences between the groups. Odds ratios of less than 1.5 tended to be nonsignificant in our models. So, important but smaller differences between groups could have been missed. Some of our measures did not utilize standardized scales or indices. For example, our measure of systemic exclusion was a composite measure of standard items developed in conjunction with the participation of our community advisory committee and made sense for our participants in our setting. There is a global literature on the measurement of social exclusion that could inform researchers in other settings. 50 Furthermore, we did not assess gender assigned at birth, and consequently, it is possible that we misclassified some individuals who had changed gender, but did not endorse any of the trans identities. This would bias our results toward the null hypothesis.\nOur study adds to existing but limited evidence that factors related to social exclusion comprise barriers to mental health services and effective depression treatment, thus, contributing to mental health disparities associated with minority sexual orientations and gender identities. [9][10][11][12][13] In our study, individuals with low income were more likely to report an unmet need for healthcare, but less likely to report a 12-month history of untreated depression. In Canada, which has universal healthcare coverage, physician-provided mental healthcare is provided without user fees or limits-this leads to higher rates of treatment in lower income groups who have higher rates of mental health morbidity. 51 Other Canadian studies have identified that ongoing unmet need in the context of treated depression is often related to a perceived need for counseling. 52 In Canada, counseling provided by non-physician providers is not covered by our universal health insurance. Since sexual and gender minorities are overrepresented among low SES groups, 53 economic insecurity may compound the difficulties that sexual and gender minority people face to access receptive, diversity-competent (racially competent, LGBT competent) mental health counseling services.\nSocial exclusion includes elements such as experiences of discrimination and exclusionary healthcare practices that are highly relevant to LGBT communities. 54 In this regard, our study findings on rates of perceived unmet need for mental healthcare and untreated depression are aligned with existing research that associates social exclusion with lower levels of mental health service access. 55,56 While the importance of the social determinants of health has been widely acknowledged in the realms of population and public health, the understanding of health as contextual has not been translated into the mental health system, which continues to rely on a predominantly biomedical approach to treatment. 57 If social exclusion is central to the experience of mental health services for LGBT people (and indeed, for other communities that experience marginalization), the predominance of the biomedical model may, in fact, be inequitable in that it is less likely to meet the needs of some groups than others.\nThese findings suggest a need to explore models of mental healthcare that can more adequately address the experience of social exclusion that may be fundamental to meeting the mental health service needs of LGBT people. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings using a population-based sample; as noted above, this requires improvements to many population-based data sources in most countries or states to enable identification of sexual, and in particular, gender minority people. Research is needed to further explore the mental health needs and experiences of the highest risk groups, in particular, that is, trans and bisexual identified individuals, as well as LGBT individuals with intersecting marginalized identities, such as those related to class and racialization. Finally, research is needed to determine which models of healthcare, as well as which specific mental health interventions, are effective for LGBT people specifically. The field of LGBT mental health research has to date largely focused on description, and intervention research for this population is sorely needed.\nIn sum, our finding of high rates of unmet need for mental healthcare and untreated depression, with elevated rates among transgender people and bisexual women in particular, suggests that the mental health system is not currently meeting the needs of many sexual and gender minority people.

Various contraceptive methods have been associated with changes in sexual function. Methods: In this narrative review, we selected key articles based on our collective clinical experience. We summarized findings and best practice recommendations for addressing a woman's contraception and its potential relationship to sexual function. Results: Although some hormonal contraception is associated with sexual dysfunction, studies show mixed results based on route of administration and progestin component. Interestingly, nonuse of contraception also appears to be associated with sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction. Low-dose vaginal estrogen, lubricants, and moisturizers may be used for treating vaginal dryness in the setting of hypoestrogenic states in reproductive-age women. Conclusion: A review of current contraception is appropriate for women presenting with sexual health concerns. Sexual dysfunction chronologically associated with a contraceptive may be addressed by trial of an alternative method. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment is recommended, including sex therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, and consultation with a women's health specialist as needed.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A pproximately, 37.6 million women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 years use contraception. Among these women, the most commonly used method is the oral contraceptive (OC) (16%), followed by female sterilization (15.5%), condoms (9.4%), and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) (7.2%). 1 LARC, which includes levonorgestrel and copper intrauterine contraception (IUC) and the etonogestrel contraceptive implant, has gained increased acceptance among women throughout their reproductive lifespan for its safety, efficacy, and convenience. Approximately, 38% of US women do not use contraception, and about one-half of US pregnancies are unintended. 1,2 Overall, 27% of reproductive-age US women (aged 18-44 years) report sexual dysfunction, with low sexual desire being the most common, and 10.8% of these women also experience related distress. 3 Contraception may affect female sexual function both positively and negatively. However, relatively few recent studies have summarized the relationship of currently available combined hormonal contraceptive formulations, both oral and nonoral, as well as progestin-only and nonhormonal contraception, on female sexual functioning. This is a narrative review of the impact of various contraceptives on female sexual function based on available evidence. We did not systematically review and summarize data from all existing epidemiologic or clinical studies, nor did we perform an exhaustive review of the literature to include all relevant studies. We selected articles on the basis of their applicability to US women and practical relevance to US clinicians. We provide clinical recommendations regarding the care of women with sexual health concerns potentially related to contraception.

Another study showed decreased measures of sexual interest and arousal 3 months after starting oral CHC, but no change in the enjoyment of sexual activity. 6 In a study involving 2,612 healthy medical students, CHC use was associated with a higher rate of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) than use of nonhormonal contraception. 7 In contrast, Spanish women attending a family planning clinic reported increased sexual desire at 12 months with the use of either oral CHC or copper IUC. 8 No significant differences were observed in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores between the groups. 8 The lack of consistency in findings highlights the complex and multifactorial nature of female sexual function and focuses on the need for a comprehensive approach to management.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Nonuse of contraception", "text": "The use of no contraception was associated with a higher rate of FSD than the use of either CHC or nonhormonal methods. 7 Furthermore, lower rates of sexual dysfunction were noted among women using either copper IUC (21%) or a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) (10%) than among women using no contraception (35%). 9 Another study 10 noted that the frequencies of sexual activity and sexual enjoyment were positively correlated with contraceptive satisfaction. Among other reasons, diminished sexual function perceived to be related to contraception may lead to nonuse of effective contraception, and conversely, nonuse of contraception may in itself be a factor in sexual dysfunction, perhaps owing to concerns about unintended pregnancy.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Oral CHC, androgens, and sexual function", "text": "Oral CHC has been linked to vaginal dryness and decreased lubrication, in addition to decreased arousal, sexual pleasure, and orgasm frequency and increased sexual pain. 5 These findings may be related to decreased circulating androgen levels with oral CHC use. This occurs by two mechanisms as follows: (1) Oral CHC increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, and (2) androgen production from the ovary is suppressed with oral CHC. 11 This antiandrogenic effect may be magnified with oral CHC containing an antiandrogenic progestin. 12 Although some studies have shown no change or improvement in sexual function with oral CHC use, both with drospirenone-containing 13,14 and levonorgestrel-containing formulations, 15 other studies have associated oral CHC use with adverse effects on sexual function, particularly sexual desire. [16][17][18][19] One study showed decreased sexual interest and arousal 3 months after patients started oral CHC therapy, but no change in the enjoyment of sexual activity. 6 Interestingly, this study also found that 74% of study participants had a significant decrease in free testosterone without impairment of sexual interest or response.\nAlthough evidence shows that testosterone has a role in sexual function for women, this conclusion is derived primarily from studies involving postmenopausal women reporting sexual dysfunction. Testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women has been associated with improvement in multiple dimensions of sexual function, including sexual desire, subjective arousal, vaginal blood flow, and frequency of orgasm. 20 However, the relevance of changes in androgen levels for an individual woman is unclear, and some women may be more sensitive to androgen level alteration than others. Most of the studies included in the previously mentioned systematic review 4 showed alterations in SHBG and testosterone levels, despite the overall lack of association between CHC and sexual desire.\nThe density of androgen receptors is greater in the external genitalia than in the vagina, 21 and androgens are thought to be necessary for glycoprotein synthesis in the formation of mucus. 22 Thus, a relative androgen deficiency could contribute to vulvar and vaginal dryness in addition to decreased arousal, sexual pleasure, orgasm frequency, and increased sexual pain 5 associated with oral CHC. Oral CHC has also been associated with vestibulodynia (vestibular pain) in several but not all studies. [23][24][25][26] Longer duration of oral CHC use and younger age at initiation have been associated with higher relative risk of vestibulodynia. 23 The mixed study findings about the relationship between the use of oral CHC and sexual function do not allow for clear-cut recommendations, although the potential association begs a review of contraception in any reproductive-aged woman presenting with FSD.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The relationship of progestin androgenicity and sexual function", "text": "Any antiandrogenic effect may be magnified when the contraceptive contains a progestin with lower androgenicity. 12 Among the contraceptive progestins available in the United States, norgestrel and levonorgestrel are most androgenic; norethindrone and norethindrone acetate are less androgenic; and desogestrel, etonogestrel, norgestimate, dienogest, and drospirenone are the least androgenic. 27 With the potential effect of CHC on androgens in mind, investigators have focused on the relative androgenicity of CHC, as well as the addition of androgen to some CHC, to ameliorate the negative effect of CHC on sexual function. In a randomized controlled trial of drospirenone-containing OC followed by the addition of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or placebo to the same OC, the combination of DHEA and OC was not associated with improvement in sexual function and further negated the benefit of OC on acne. 28 Davis et al. 29 described improved sexual arousal and desire (using the FSFI) in women taking an antiandrogenic (dienogest) or an androgenic (levonorgestrel) progestin-containing oral CHC.

Yet another study 36 noted a slight decrease in sexual function when women switched from oral CHC to a vaginal ring compared with a contraceptive patch. Notably, concerns were ring related rather than hormone related, and neither difference was thought to be clinically significant. 36 Therefore, the ring appears to be a reasonable alternative to oral CHC for women with sexual function concerns.\nAmong women using depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), 5.8% experienced a decrease in libido. 37 Yet, in a comparison of DMPA and oral CHC, no difference was found in desire, arousal, and total FSFI scores despite lower testosterone levels in the women taking oral CHC. 38 Similarly, sexual interest was unchanged among adolescents taking DMPA compared with CHC over 41 months 39 and in adolescents using DMPA compared with nonhormonal contraception. 40 These findings support a lack of association with relative progestin androgenicity and sexual function.

Authors of one study 9 noted lower rates of sexual dysfunction in women using either the copper IUC (21%) or LNG-IUS (10%) compared with no contraception. Moreover, they reported a significant positive association between LNG-IUS use and sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and overall sexual function compared with no contraception. Of note, LNG-IUS was associated with greater desire, arousal, and overall sexual function than the copper IUC. Another study 43 likewise reported high satisfaction rates with both LNG-IUS and copper IUC, but no difference in sexual function overall and within psychological domains.\nOne study of the etonogestrel implant showed improvement in arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain during sexual intercourse, 44 whereas another 30 reported increased positive indicators of sexual function (interest and fantasies, orgasm number and intensity, and satisfaction) and decreased negative indicators (anxiety and discomfort) in implant users compared with women using nonhormonal methods.

However, if secondary vestibulodynia or decreased sexual desire develops while a woman is taking CHC, the CHC may be a contributing factor. Likewise, the biopsychosocial model (Fig. 1) can provide a framework for identifying the elements contributing to sexual dysfunction in women. [52][53][54] For example, in the biologic domain, it is useful to review the medical history for contributing factors (e.g., history of pelvic surgery, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular or neurologic disease) and other medications that might be contributing (e.g., antidepressants, opioid pain medications, and some antihypertensive medications). Factors in the psychological domain that may have a role include stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and body image concerns. Relationship factors that should be assessed include relationship quality, communication, and partner sexual function. In the sociocultural domain, societal or religious views and lack of sex education may contribute to sexual dysfunction.

Vaginal lubricants may provide temporary relief of discomfort from vaginal dryness associated with sexual activity. In the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, 65.5% of 1,021 US women aged 18 years or older endorsed lubricant use; the reason cited most often was ''to make sex more comfortable''. 56 The majority of women participating in a daily diary study reported positive perceptions of lubricant use, including increased pleasure and comfort. 57 Sharing information on the high frequency of use and positive results experienced across age-groups may be helpful in counseling reproductive-aged women about using lubricants. 57 In addition to lubricant use with sexual activity, vaginal moisturizers may be applied several times per week to help maintain vaginal moisture. 58  effectiveness of low-dose vaginal estrogen to treat genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes symptoms of vaginal dryness and lack of lubrication with intercourse, along with urinary tract symptoms. 59,60 The 2013 North American Menopause Society guideline on management of symptomatic GSM further acknowledges that hypoestrogenic states and subsequent GSM may occur in women of childbearing age, including lactating women. 59,61 The guidelines do not include specific recommendations for low-dose vaginal estrogen in reproductive-aged women with contraception-associated vulvar and vaginal dryness.

Review of a temporal relationship between the onset of FSD and initiation of contraception is warranted, as is an assessment with the biopsychosocial model of other potential contributing factors to FSD.\nA multidisciplinary approach to the management of FSD is suggested, particularly when multiple contributing or complicating factors are identified (e.g., sexual pain, relationship discord, multiple comorbid medical conditions, and a history of sexual abuse) and may consist of consultations with a sex therapist, pelvic floor physical therapist, and sexual health specialist as indicated.\nNo clear guidelines exist for management of sexual dysfunction potentially associated with CHC in reproductiveaged women. A nonoral CHC, progestin-only, or nonhormonal LARC may be options for women with FSD associated with oral CHC.

The purpose of this study was to look at the unique contributions of sex, age, and the Gender Index (GI) to baseline health status in a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Participants and Methods: Questions that comprised the GI were included in the follow-up questionnaire sent to patients in the APPROACH registry. To examine the relationship between sex, gender, and health status, a sequential linear regression modeling approach was used. Results: A total of 632 patients completed the GI between July and August 2015. The women were significantly older (68 years vs. 66 years, p = 0.02) and significantly more likely to have hypertension (50.8% vs. 38.8%, p = 0.02) compared to the men. Women reported significantly lower mean Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) scores compared to men. The inclusion of age into the models did not change the relationship between sex and the SAQ scales. However, the inclusion of the GI attenuated the relationship between sex and the SAQ scale scores. Conclusions: Our results support the concept that sex differences in health status outcomes may be better explained by patient's gender-related characteristics, than biological sex characteristics.

[8][9][10][11][12] Taking into consideration that the data had been adjusted for all known cardiac-related risk factors, including recognized cardiac-related psychosocial variables (depression, anxiety, and social support), we postulate that the persistent sex differences in health status may be attributed to social factors such as gender roles.\nWhile it has been identified that gender (socially manufactured roles, behaviors, expressions, and identities) 13 plays a central role in men's and women's health, the distinction between gender and sex (biological attributes) has largely been ignored in health science research. One aspect of the GENESIS-PRAXY study 14 was the development of a ''gender index,'' which measures gender and offers a pragmatic means to explore the relationship between sex, gender, and health outcomes. 15 The purpose of this study was to look at the unique contributions of sex, age, and the Gender Index (GI) to baseline health status in a cohort of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for CAD.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study population", "text": "Eligible participants included all Alberta residents aged >18 years with at least 1-vessel CAD who were undergoing an index catheterization between July 2015 and Sept 2015 and were enrolled in the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) registry. APPROACH is a comprehensive, prospective, longitudinal inception cohort of all adult residents in the province of Alberta, Canada, undergoing catheterization for CAD captured through the APPROACH registry used for this analysis. The APPROACH project began data collection in 1995 and has been previously described. 16 Briefly, the APPROACH database contains detailed clinical information, including the results from catheterization, and is merged biannually with mortality data from the Vital Statistics Registry. Individuals in the APPROACH registry are followed longitudinally after catheterization, thus allowing for assessment of subsequent procedures (i.e., percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), as well as the outcomes of mortality. Health status/health-related quality of life data are collected through a follow-up questionnaire mailed at baseline (within 1 week of catheterization), and the 1, 3, and 5 anniversaries of the index catheterization. For the purpose of this study, questions that comprised the GI were included in the baseline follow-up questionnaire sent to patients in the APPROACH registry (Appendix). The GI was constructed using data from GENESIS-PRAXY (Gender and Sex Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease: From Bench to Beyond -Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome [ACS]), a multicenter observational study of patients with premature ACS. 14 The detailed methodology of the GENESIS-PRAXY study and the construction of the GI have been previously published. 14,15 Briefly, a composite measure of genderrelated characteristics was created using variables collected through GENESIS-PRAXY study that reflected four interrelated aspects of the gender construct: gender roles, gender identity, gender relationships, and institutionalized gender. Seventeen variables identified on the retained components from the principal component analysis were included in a logistic regression model using biological sex as the dependent variable. This was done to define objectively the variables that were associated with the reality of being bio-logically female or male in the GENESIS-PRAXY cohort. Seven variables that were independently associated with biological sex and, therefore, included in the gender score were (1) primary earner in the household, (2) personal income, (3) numbers of hours per week spent doing housework, (4) status of primary person responsible for doing housework, (5) level of stress at home, (6) Bem Sex Role Inventory masculinity score, and (7) Bem Sex Role Inventory femininity score. The gender-related score represents the probability (between 0% and 100%) for each patient to be a ''woman''. The lower the reported score, the more the patient reported characteristics traditionally ascribed to men and the higher the score, the more the patient reported characteristics ascribed to being a woman. Intermediate scores represent patients with an equivalent level of characteristics traditionally ascribed to women and men. 17 This study was approved by the University of Alberta Ethics Review Committee and subjects gave informed consent as indicated by returning the completed questionnaire.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sociodemographics and clinical variables", "text": "Baseline data (i.e., index catheterization) were collected in the APPROACH registry.

Logistic modeling yielded similar coefficient estimates that were statistically independently associated with sex. As well the GI did an excellent job of discriminating between sexes producing similar c statistics (0.89) as those produced in the original construction of the GI c statistics (0.90). 15 To examine the relationship between sex, gender, and health status, as indicated by SAQ dimensional scores, we used a sequential linear regression modeling approach. Three models were created for each SAQ dimension. Using the baseline SAQ scale scores as the dependent variables, model 1 included sex, model 2 included sex and age, and model 3 included sex, age, and the GI. Estimated means for each of the SAQ scale scores were calculated to determine the mean difference in SAQ dimensional scores between sexes after adjusting for age and GI.\nFinally, to determine the relative contribution of the GI, we used sequential logistic models by dichotomizing the SAQ scores into: no restrictions due to angina (SAQ Physical limitation = 100) versus any (SAQ Physical limitation <100), the angina frequency score into no angina over the past 4 weeks (SAQ Angina frequency = 100) versus any (SAQ Angina frequency <100), no experience of angina when doing a strenuous activity (SAQ Angina stability = 100) versus any angina (SAQ Angina stability <100), satisfaction with treatment (SAQ Treatment satisfaction = 100) versus less than completely satisfied (SAQ Treatment satisfaction <100), and satisfied with present QoL (SAQ QoL = 100) versus less than completely satisfied with QoL (SAQ QoL <100).

Of the 532 (84%) who completed all the questions in the GI, 24.4% were women (n = 130). The women were significantly older (68 years vs. 66 years, p = 0.02) and significantly more likely to have hypertension (50.8% vs. 38.8%, p = 0.02) compared to the men. There were no other significant differences between sexes in comorbidities recorded at catheterization (Table 1).\nTable 2 presents the gender characteristics as identified in the GI by men and women. Compared to the men, women were significantly less likely to be the primary earner in the household (41% vs. 77%), more likely to report being the primary person responsible for housework (74.6% vs. 17.7%), report an income below $30,000 per year (43.8% vs. 17.7%), and report higher levels of stress at home. Table 3 presents the baseline disease-specific health status measures by sex. Women reported statistically significantly worse SAQ dimensional scores at baseline compared to the men. Women reported more disease-specific physical limitations (62.4 -25 vs.76.8 -23, p < 0.001), more angina frequency (82.3 -22 vs. 86.7 -19, p = 0.03), less angina stability (71.6 -32 vs. 79.0 -28, p = 0.02), less treatment satisfaction (84.6 -16 vs. 89.9 -14, p = 0.001), and worse QoL (63.2 -25 vs. 69.3 -23, p = 0.01) than men. Men were more likely to report perfect SAQ dimensional scores (100) in all five scales compared to women and these relationships were significant in the Physical limitation (9.2% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.002) and Treatment satisfaction (32.3% vs. 45.3%, p = 0.009) scales.\nTable 4 presents the baseline SAQ dimensional scores adjusted for age (model 2) and age and the GI (model 3). Women continue to report statistically significantly lower scores across all SAQ dimensional scores when adjusted for age. However, while the women continue to report lower scores than the men when adjusting for age and the GI score, the difference between mean SAQ scores is no longer statistically significant. The variables in the GI appear to attenuate the difference in health status between men and women with CAD.\nTable 5 presents the odds ratios comparing men and woman, resulting from sequential logistic models using categorical SAQ dimensional outcomes created by dichotomizing the SAQ scores into 1 = no restrictions due to angina (SAQ score = 100) versus 0 = any restrictions (SAQ <100).

Men were more than two and \u00bd times more likely to report no physical limitation due to angina (odds ratio 2.75, 95% CI 1.38-5.50) compared to women. Furthermore, compared to women, men were also almost twice more likely to report being totally satisfied with the treatment they were receiving for their angina symptoms (odds ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.38). More importantly, in each of the SAQ dimensions, the addition of the GI attenuated the difference between the odds ratio of men who reported perfect scores compared to the women suggesting that psychosocial variables related to gender may have more significant associations with health status compared to biological sex. Finally, the c statistics for each of the models indicate that inclusion of the GI increased the predictive accuracy of the models in all SAQ dimensional scales.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we report on the independent contribution of a composite gender index for measuring gender, to the health status of patients undergoing an index catheterization for CAD. While literature focusing on the importance of distinguishing gender from sex, as well as the role gender may play in the incidence of heart disease, has multiplied, 17 to our knowledge the GI is the first gender-related instrument developed for patients with CAD. In the wider health outcome research, gender and sex are increasingly recognized as independent yet synergistic outcome determinants. 21,22 This analysis adds to the literature that specifies that gender, over and above sex, is a distinct construct that can be measured by the GI. More importantly, the increased predictive accuracy of the models that included the GI suggests that the psychosocial variables included in the GI provide more infor-mation in understanding the differences in self-reported health status between men and women undergoing catheterization for CAD.\nWhile women reported statistically worse health status in all five SAQ dimensional scores compared to men, this relationship was attenuated when the GI was added to the models. As we measured baseline health status within 1 week of catheterization, these results also suggest that similar to the findings from the VIRGO study, 23 the management of health status before a heart event may differ for men and women and that women's reported lower health status may be due to gender-related issues as opposed to biological sex. More importantly, our results propose that secondary prevention in patients with CAD should incorporate attention to gender-related characteristics and not only sexspecific risks.\nOur previous studies have identified that women consistently report poorer health status outcomes at one year following treatment for CAD compared to men. [8][9][10][11][12] These differences continued even after adjustments for comorbidities, coronary anatomy, depression and anxiety symptomatology, baseline health status, and health-related QoL. As a   MEASURING GENDER-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS: A CANADIAN GENDER INDEX result, we have continued to note the differences in outcomes between men and women without identifying explanations for the differences. The results of this study suggest that the differences may be partially explained by patients' gender roles and life context. For example, men and women who are responsible for the care of family and housework, who have poor stress management and do not have the necessary resources, may adopt health behaviors that along with other imbalances lead to risk factors that enhance the development of CAD. In addition, work by Lundberg and Frankkenhaeuser has shown that women in nontraditional occupations selfreport more masculine or assertive gender roles that put them at greater risk for stress-related disease. Higher levels of stress for working women who must often balance multiple work, family roles, and responsibilities can strain their health and well-being. 24 Similar to evidence identified in the development of the GI, 15 being the primary earner in the house and the primary person responsible for doing the housework were two of the gender-related variables with the highest weight in the calculation of the gender score. This would suggest that financial responsibility and home-related workload continue to play a role in the risk factor profiles of men and women with CAD and these variables are typically NOT accounted for in our present risk stratification models.\nPrevious studies have identified associations between family roles and heart disease 25 and an association between less social support, more anxiety, and increased work home burdens and health status. 15,23 Our results add to the literature that sex differences in health status and HRQoL may be better explained by patient gender-related characteristics than the biological sex characteristics. 17 More importantly, the GI offers a composite gender index to assess the effects of psychosocial factors in a pragmatic way that provides a composite score that researchers interested in measuring gender could use in studies of subjects with CAD.\nThe approach of using the GI that considers gender as a bipolar one-dimensional continuum recognizes that gender-related variables can be present in both men and women at different levels. This has the methodological advantage of having only one variable to include in multivariate models. Conversely, by collecting the genderrelated variables that make up the GI, there is the ability to address the unique psychosocial variables not typically collected in CAD registries. Given that the data are collected at baseline, further assessment and treatments of gender-related variables could be incorporated into secondary prevention management.\nOur findings should be interpreted within the context of several potential limitations. First, the APPROACH registry is an observational collection of data on all patients catheterized for CAD in the province of Alberta and observed sex differences in health status may be due to residual confounding. However, clinical and comorbid variables collected at catheterization on all Alberta patients allow us to compare the respondents and nonrespondents on a broad range of clinical/comorbid factors. This analysis (not presented) indicates that the patients who responded to the baseline follow-up survey were similar to those patients who were unable to or chose not to respond. Second, as our ''baseline'' in APPROACH is the index catheterization, we asked patients to respond to the health status measures recalling their symptoms before the index angiogram. There is therefore the potential for recall bias. Nevertheless, the objective of this study was to address the sex differences in health status and there is no reason to suggest that men or women are more likely to experience recall bias. Third, our cohort comprised a majority of men and because gender and sex are interrelated, our results may have been influenced by this distribution. However, the prevalence by sex in our cohort is consistent with what is observed in other CAD cohorts 26,27 and we believe the sex and gender distribution we observed is representative as well. As a sensitivity analysis, we used propensity matching (based on clinical and comorbid factors) to match 122 men with 122 women in the sample. Both the linear and logistic regression modeling produced the same outcomes, indicating that statistically significant sex differences in SAQ outcomes were attenuated when adding the GI to the models. Finally, the GI was developed using a sample of young (less than 55 years) men and women with ACS and the variables in the index could be more reflective of younger patients with CAD. However, logistic modeling yielded similar coefficient estimates to those in the GI construction modeling that were statistically independently associated with sex. In addition, the GI did an excellent job of discriminating between sexes producing similar c statistics (0.89) as those produced in the original construction of the GI c statistics (0.90). 15 Age stratified analyses also indicated that the GI was able to discriminate between sexes regardless of age: age less than 55 years-c statistic 0.93, age 55-65 years-c statistic 0.88, and age greater than 65 years-c statistic 0.89.\nFinally, while we collect ethnicity in the APPROACH follow-up survey, there is little or no variation in reported ethnicity with greater than 90% reporting being of European white decent.\nIn conclusion, this analysis adds to the literature that specifies that gender is a distinct construct separate from biological sex and that the GI may be an appropriate index for measuring index in patients with CAD. The increased predictive accuracy of the models that included the GI suggests that the psychosocial variables included in the GI provide more information in understanding the differences in selfreported health status between men and women undergoing catheterization for CAD. Furthermore, our results support the concept that sex differences in health status outcomes may be better explained by gender-related characteristics than biological sex characteristics.

Materials and Methods: In this case-control study we retrospectively assessed self-reported new and recurrent yeast infections prior and subsequent to first vulvar pain onset among 216 clinically confirmed cases and during a similar time period for 224 general population controls. Results: A history of >10 yeast infections before vulvodynia onset was strongly but imprecisely associated with currently diagnosed vulvodynia after adjustment for age, age at first intercourse, and history of urinary tract infections [adjusted odds ratio = 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-17.8]. Likewise, a history of vulvodynia was associated with a twofold risk of subsequent new or recurrent onset of yeast infections after adjustment for age, age at first intercourse, and history of yeast infections before vulvodynia onset (comparable time period among controls, 95% CI 1.5-2.9). Bias analyses showed that our observed associations were an underestimation of the true association when nondifferential misclassification of self-reported yeast infections and certain differential misclassification scenarios were present. However, if women with vulvodynia more frequently misreported having them when they truly did not, our observed associations were an overestimate of the truth. Conclusions: There appears to be a positive relationship between yeast infections preceding and following the diagnosis of vulvodynia, but this relationship varies from strong to nonexistent depending on the relative accuracy of the recalled diagnosis of yeast infections among cases and controls. To better understand the bidirectional associations between yeast infections and vulvodynia, future validation studies are needed to determine the extent to which misclassification of self-reported yeast infections differs between women with and without vulvodynia.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "V ulvodynia is highly prevalent in the general population, 1 defined as debilitating vulvar discomfort due to burning pain or pain on contact that occurs in the absence of clinically visible pathological findings or identifiable disorders. 2 Over the years, many studies have suggested an association between vulvodynia and vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast) infections. [3][4][5] Although several biological hypotheses have been suggested, including genetic susceptibility to Candida antigens, eliciting an altered immune response that results in chronic inflammation, 6 or abnormal sensory processing as a result of repeated candidiasis infections, 7 it is difficult to conclude that Candida infections are causally associated with new onset of vulvodynia. This is largely due to the inability of women to accurately recognize candidiasis infections, the poor reliability between telephone consultation with clinical providers and a true diagnosis, and the inadequate workup when women do seek care for their infections. [8][9][10] Add to that the limitation of prior studies to elucidate the timing of the yeast infections in relation to the onset of vulvodynia symptoms and this association becomes very challenging to study.\nHowever, it is difficult to ignore much of the biologically relevant evidence that suggests an important role for Candida in understanding vulvodynia pathogenesis. Evidence free of yeast exposure misclassification and the temporal relationship between yeast exposure and vulvar pain comes from a preclinical study of 15 mice where after 3 rounds of induced Candida infections, 6 experienced allodynia, based on hind paw sensitivity to von frey filament applications and visible signs of increased vulvar innervation, suggesting that multiple antecedent infections may be a potential risk factor for new onset vulvodynia. 7 This is somewhat consistent with our earlier finding of a substantially increased risk of vulvodynia as a consequence of increasing numbers of self-reported past urogenital tract infections. 11 Determining whether yeast infections (1) lead to the development of vulvar pain symptoms, or (2) can increase in frequency as a result of immunological or microbiota changes that might have occurred as a consequence of developing vulvodynia, is critical for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disorder. In our recently completed population-based study of women with and without clinically confirmed vulvodynia, we assessed self-reported yeast infections prior and subsequent to new and clinically confirmed vulvodynia onset to begin to sort out the temporal relationship between recurrent yeast infections and vulvodynia. Because self-reported candidiasis infections may be measured imperfectly, we used quantitative bias analysis to explore how these findings would change under plausible assumptions on the range of sensitivity and specificity of selfreported candidiasis infections under scenarios of nondifferential and differential misclassification.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board approved this study and all participants provided written consent. Data for the present analyses were collected as part of a case-control study to explore etiological predictors of vulvodynia. Women 18-40 years of age, who were part of the administrative database of a large healthcare network that represents *27% of the population in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area, were initially recruited through selfadministered surveys to examine the prevalence of vulvar pain. They had been seen for any reason in 1 of over 40 community health clinics within a 2-year window between March 2010 and October 2013; 30,676 screeners were received. This self-administered vulvar pain assessment has been previously described. 12 Women likely to meet the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Diseases criteria for vulvodynia based on their initial survey responses were invited to participate in a clinical visit to confirm the diagnosis. 13 Of the 1,398 women invited, 350 completed their examination, and 234 were clinically confirmed. We compared screener questionnaire characteristics of those who agreed and did not agree to a clinical evaluation. In this assessment, we found no important differences in demographic characteristics (age, race, and marital status) or reproductive history (age at menarche, cycle regularity, and history of oral contraceptive use). Likewise, characteristics of the vulvar pain, such as limiting or preventing sexual intercourse, having never had a period of pain free intercourse versus secondary onset of pain that developed after a period of pain free intercourse, whether pain was provoked as opposed to continuous, and having sought care for their vulvar pain, were similar between those who did and did not agree to the clinical assessment.\nWomen from this same pool of screened women with no history of vulvar discomfort were randomly selected and invited to serve as controls. Of 2,287 women invited, 251 agreed and 234 were clinically confirmed as having no ongoing or past history of vulvar pain. These clinically confirmed, eligible, and enrolled controls were matched to a case and assigned a reference age identical to the age at first onset of vulvar pain in the matched case. Controls had to be older than the age at which their matched case was diagnosed with vulvodynia. On average controls were about 2 years older than cases. The interval length between actual age and age at onset of vulvodynia in cases, and actual age and reference age in controls, was no more than 2 years as well. This allowed for assessments of exposures in controls that were comparable to cases both prior and subsequent to onset of vulvodynia.\nAdditional eligibility criteria for both cases and controls included having no active genitourinary infections at the time of their clinical visit, and if parous, being at least 1-year postpartum. Women were asked to refrain from introducing anything into their vaginas for 48 hours before the clinical visit. Clinically confirmed, eligible, and enrolled cases selfreported the age at which they first experienced vulvar pain.\nAll cases and controls completed a background and medical history questionnaire by telephone that covered demographic characteristics, sexual and reproductive history, and personal hygiene practices. For cases, we attempted to collect all historical information within the temporal context of their age at first onset of vulvar pain (before and after) when appropriate. The same information was obtained for controls based on their assigned reference age. Thus, exposures were assessed using the same temporal context for both cases and controls.\nWe recorded the age of the woman at the time of her first self-reported yeast infection and whether she indicated the infection was clinically confirmed. We then asked the participant to indicate the category (0, 1-4, 5-10, 11-20, 21-30, >30) that represents the number of infections, subsequent to the initial infection, that occurred before vulvodynia onset (or reference age in controls) and then the number of infections subsequent to vulvodynia onset (or reference age in controls). We then obtained the following information for the aggregated category of number of yeast infections: proportion self-reported as clinically confirmed, frequency of use of over-the-counter medication, and treatment success. We also collected information on other urogynecological infections, including urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, genital warts, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and genital herpes. All were temporally assessed in relation to first onset of vulvar pain in cases and reference age in controls.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The analyses were based on 216 cases and 224 controls in which all main exposure and primary covariates were successfully obtained. Thus, the reference age matching was not retained, but assessed as a covariate. We first assessed differences in key demographic, personal, and medical history characteristics and then differences in these same characteristics among those who did and did not self-report yeast infections. Models were created to examine two distinct time periodsbefore the onset of vulvodynia or reference age (referred to as the antecedent model) and at or after the onset of vulvodynia or reference age (referred to as the post-onset model). The association between yeast infections and subsequent onset of vulvodynia is based on a case-control analysis, and odds ratios are presented. The post-vulvodynia onset (reference age in controls) yeast infection estimate is based on a retrospective cohort analysis and we therefore present relative risk estimates. For both analyses, potential confounders were selected from the literature and are described in the results in reference to Table 1. The models were refined using logistic regression with stepwise selection.\nAfter assessing all potential confounders and effect modifiers, our final antecedent model to estimate the influence of yeast infections on risk of vulvodynia included number of antecedent yeast infections (none, 1-4, 5-10, >10), current age, age at first sexual intercourse, and history of urinary tract infections.\nThe post-onset model, which assesses the risk of post-onset yeast infection among those with and without vulvodynia, used log-binomial models to estimate risk ratios (RRs). The post-onset model adjusted for current age, age at first intercourse, and history of yeast infections and categorized yeast infections as <5 or \u20215. A post-onset sensitivity analysis was conducted limited to the subset of women with no antecedent yeast infections. This allowed for the assessment of vulvodynia on the risk of new and post-onset only yeast infections. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).\nTo assess the impact of misclassification of yeast infection in both the antecedent infection and post-onset infection analyses, we performed a quantitative bias analysis. 14 We investigated two distinct hypotheses about the misclassification, scenarios that applied to both the antecedent infection analysis and the post-onset analysis. In the first scenario, we considered it plausible that misreporting of yeast infections was the same regardless of whether a woman had vulvodynia or not (i.e., nondifferential misclassification). This scenario might occur if all women had difficulty remembering how many infections they had or there were errors in self-diagnosis, but with no distinct pattern (i.e., the rates of misclassification would be the same among those with and without vulvodynia). This would lead to an expected bias toward the null such that we would have underestimated the true association. However, the magnitude of that bias is unclear.\nFor the second scenario, we considered it plausible that women with vulvodynia would be less likely to underreport their number of yeast infections (both before and after diagnosis of vulvodynia) if they had \u20215 yeast infections but more likely to over report their number of yeast infections if they in fact had <5 yeast infections. This scenario might occur if women with vulvodynia spent more time trying to explain their pain by carefully recounting their yeast infections and potentially remembering more than there were, while women without vulvar pain would not have such stimulus to help them remember their infections. This would likely lead to our associations over estimating the truth, but again the magnitude is unclear.\nIn the antecedent infection model, we assessed the impact of misclassification of number of pre-onset yeast infections as the exposure at levels of specificity ranging from 0.85 to 1.0 among vulvodynia cases (the greatest range possible based on only 16.2% of cases reporting \u20215 yeast infections before the reference age). For controls, we assessed a specificity range from 0.93 to 1.0 (the greatest range possible based on only 8.5% of controls reporting \u20215 yeast infections after the reference age). For both cases and controls, we assessed sensitivity values of 0.50, 0.70, and 0.90.

We retained the same sensitivity values of 0.50, 0.70, and 0.90 as in the pre-vulvodynia onset models.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Cases were younger than controls by 2 years, but the reference age assigned to controls was comparable to that of age at first onset of vulvodynia symptoms within a few months (Table 1). Relative to controls, women with vulvodynia were more likely to report a history of anxiety, prior urinary tract infections, a family history of depression, chronic constipation, allergies to medications, and chronic overlapping pain conditions. All the variables presented in Table 1 were assessed as potential confounders or modifiers of the associations between yeast infections and vulvodynia. It should be noted that only one case and eight controls self-reported a history of diabetes which, although associated with greater risk of yeast infections, had little impact on our results.\nAfter adjustment for current age and age at first sexual intercourse, there was little difference in risk of vulvodynia by age at first onset of yeast infections. Among women who reported a history of yeast infections before onset of vulvodynia or assigned reference age, those whose first yeast infection was diagnosed by clinicians had about a 60% greater odds of vulvodynia than women whose first yeast infection was not diagnosed by a clinician (Table 2). A strong dose response was observed in the association between antecedent yeast infections and vulvodynia with a sevenfold increase in adjusted odds associated with reporting a history of more than 10 antecedent infections and a fivefold increased odds after further adjustment for history of urinary tract infections.\nIn Table 3 we estimated the extent to which misclassification of the number of self-reported prior yeast infections may have impacted our results when comparing 5 or more self-reported infections versus <5 yeast infections in women with vulvodynia versus controls (crude odds ratio = 2.1). Each cell in Table 3 represents an estimate of the association given the assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of yeast infection misclassification. Each set of five rows represents the same assumptions about the sensitivity of the classification (probability of correctly reporting \u20215 infections when a woman truly had \u20215), but varies the assumptions about specificity (i.e., the probability of reporting <5 infections when a woman truly had <5). The cells shaded show the scenarios that resulted in our estimate of 2.1 being biased away from the null (a potential spurious inflation of the true association). Table 3 shows that under the scenario of nondifferential misclassification (shown as the bolded outlined cells), the bias was as expected toward the null (our observed estimate of 2.1 potentially underestimated the true effect). However, under nondifferential misclassification, the magnitude of effect would only increase dramatically if the probability of overreporting was as low as was plausible within the dataset (i.e., specificity of 93% among controls).\nUnder the more plausible scenario of recall bias (where sensitivity among cases is higher compared with controls and specificity is lower among cases compared with controls), the bias was such that our estimates may have overestimated the true effect. However, we overestimated the true association most often when the specificity among controls was perfect, a likely implausible scenario. We then assessed the influence of vulvodynia on the risk of new or recurrent yeast infections (Table 4). Women with vulvodynia were twice as likely to self-report \u20215 yeast infections subsequent to their vulvodynia onset compared to controls after adjustment for current age, age at first intercourse, and yeast infections occurring before the onset of vulvodynia or reference age among controls. Furthermore, when we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted only to women who's first and all subsequent yeast infections occurred after onset of vulvodynia or reference ages among controls, we observed the same twofold association (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.4) after adjustment for the same covariates above.\nFor the misclassification bias analysis, we estimated the extent to which our exposure (vulvodynia) was associated with 5 or more subsequent self-reported yeast infections (outcome) versus <5 (crude RR = 1.9) and how misclassification of the outcome (reporting of yeast infection) might affect this association. As with Table 3, each row in Table 5 shows a single RR corrected for the misclassification under the assumed values of sensitivity and specificity. As expected, when the misclassification is nondifferential (i.e., the same between cases and controls), our observed estimate of 1.9 may have been an underestimate of the true effect (as shown in the bolded outlined cells). The value of sensitivity (i.e., correctly reporting 5 or more yeast infections) plays very little role, while the value of specificity (i.e., correctly reporting fewer than 5 yeast infections) leads to a range of corrected estimates between 1.9 and 6.7. Under the more plausible situation of recall bias the corrected estimates are nearly or almost always toward the null (i.e., underestimates) suggesting our results may be an overestimate of the true effect.\nFinally, we assessed differences in the diagnostic and treatment characteristics of yeast infections in women with and without vulvodynia, by analyzing infections that occurred prior and subsequent to vulvodynia onset or reference age among controls. The proportion of yeast infections always diagnosed by a clinician did not differ among those with and without vulvodynia before onset of vulvar pain (36.5% vs. 39.8%) or subsequent to onset of vulvar pain (31.7% vs. 30.5%).

Our data did not allow us to distinguish between treatment outcomes of using over-the-counter versus prescription medications.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In an earlier study conducted in the Boston metropolitan area, women with a self-reported history of yeast infections had twice the odds of vulvodynia compared to those without after adjustment for a number of demographic and sexual history variables. 11 In this study, we report a nearly sevenfold association of vulvodynia with 10 or more antecedent yeast infections. Furthermore, in the analyses presented in this study, we adjusted for urinary tract infections (UTIs), of particular importance, because the treatment of UTI's often involves therapeutic administration of antibiotics that may put women at greater risk of yeast infections due to disrup-tions in the normal microbial ecology of the vaginal epithelium. 15 Although this adjustment did result in a substantial attenuation of the association from an odds ratio of 7.3 to an odds ratio of 5.5, it still remained highly elevated.\nOur study is the first to assess the extent to which misclassification of self-reported yeast infections alters the association with vulvodynia and in which direction. In our bias analyses, our observed associations were most often present under the implausible scenario where specificity is perfect (or near perfect) among the controls, but imperfect among the cases.\nCertainly, women suffering from vulvodynia are likely vigilant about identifying factors that may contribute to their vulvar pain. Our strongest association with vulvodynia was observed among those women reporting greater than 10 infections and thus we cannot rule out that some of this association might be due to hypervigilance of reporting on the part of women with vulvar pain. Nevertheless, the association with vulvodynia was stronger in those who reported clinically confirmed first onset of yeast infections versus those who reported that their first yeast infection was not clinically evaluated. This may suggest that the misclassification that exists with respect to self-reported yeast infections may be more nondifferential, and thus, as shown in Tables 3 and 5 stronger than what we actually observed. Furthermore, although our data limited our ability to assess misclassification of specificities lower than 0.85 among cases, we showed that as specificity decreased among controls, the risk of vulvodynia associated with yeast infections increased. However, it should also be noted that at all levels of specificity among controls, as specificity among cases decreased, the original estimate of association became more attenuated. We note that our lowest detectable values for specificity are higher than what has been reported in many studies. Unfortunately, lower values were not possible to assess within our dataset as they led to negative (i.e., impossible) corrected cells within our two-by-two tables.\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to use temporal analyses to suggest that vulvodynia may increase the risk of new or recurrent yeast infections and that post-vulvodynia onset infections are reported to be less successfully treated, compared to women with no history of vulvar pain. Biological evidence for mechanisms underlying such an association between vulvodynia and yeast infections is beginning to emerge. In a series of studies, Foster et al. [16][17][18] have shown that vestibular fibroblasts isolated from vulvodynia patients produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, compared to fibroblasts isolated from controls, when challenged with yeast antigens in vitro. Most recently, this group of researchers has demonstrated that the production of high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by vulvodynia-positive vestibular fibroblasts is regulated by Dectin-1 (a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes b-glucan on fungal cell walls) signaling through the transcription factor NFjB (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells). 16 This is particularly interesting in light of the well-characterized increases in mast cell numbers and activation status observed in vulvar biopsies of vulvodynia patients. 19,20 IL-6 is a survival factor for mast cells, 21 and activated mast cells derived from patients with atopic eczema have shown exaggerated cytokine responses to the commensal skin yeast Malassezia sympodialis, 22 suggesting that mast cell accumulation in tissue as is seen in vulvodynia patients can provoke dysregulated responses to yeast antigens thereby changing the frequency and nature of inflammatory responses to vulvovaginal Candida exposures after vulvodynia onset. Mast cells release nerve growth factor (NGF) and are increasingly recognized as neuromodulatory players in a variety of inflammatory and chronic pain disorders. 23 PGE2 has been shown to enhance expression of NGF in rat hippocampal cultures 24 and could therefore potentially directly contribute to the increased innervation seen in the vestibular tissue of vulvodynia patients. Since Foster et al. have demonstrated that as few as 100 Candida albicans colony forming units were needed to elicit this IL-6/PGE2 response in vitro by vestibular cells from vulvodynia patients, 17 their findings suggest that vestibular fibroblast-mediated inflammation can be triggered by low levels of yeast exposure (i.e., nonclinically apparent infections that may be sufficient to maintain or trigger tissue changes associated with vulvar pain). One caveat is that these studies were performed in vitro, and therefore, the dynamics and kinetics of inflammatory cytokine production observed may differ from those occurring in vivo. However, these and other mechanistic studies of fibroblast-mediated tissue changes can be performed in preclinical models of Candida-or allergenprovoked vulvar pain that have been recently described. 7,25 Such studies may also explain why post-vulvodynia yeast infections may be slower to resolve or more resistant to treatment by elucidating specific immune and neuroimmune characteristics of the altered vestibular tissue environment in which these infections take place. Along with others, we have speculated that vulvodynia may develop as a consequence of exposures such as early life stressors, 26,27 allergenic exposures, 28 or repeated urogynecological infections, 11 which affect immune response to vulvovaginal pathogens. Profound immunodeficiency certainly exacerbates susceptibility to Candidiasis in HIV+ individuals, 29 while autoreactive immune cells activated in the context of Candida infection have been proposed to predispose women with susceptible genetic backgrounds to recurrent yeast infections. 30 It is possible that, in a subset of women, the altered immune characteristics of affected vulvar tissue are associated with the development of autoimmunity that can promote recurrent yeast infections due to dysregulated local inflammation.\nGiven the specific temporal intersections of vulvar pain and yeast infection we discuss in this study, it is also interesting to consider that antecedent exposures and/or tissue changes accompanying the onset and maintenance of vulvar pain may alter the composition of the vaginal microbiota (dysbiosis) further dysregulating protective immune responses to Candida and other urogynecological pathogens. 31 Bornstein et al. implicated heparanase-mediated degradation of the vestibular stroma and epithelial basement membrane in tissue damage associated with localized provoked vulvodynia. 32 Exposure to pathogens, allergens, or injuries may all lead to such compromised mucosal barrier function that can perturb the balance of the vaginal microbiome by exposing commensals to the host immune system, inciting inappropriate inflammation and/or facilitating the colonization of noncommensal species. Across many chronic diseases, it is becoming universally recognized that persistent inflammation is accompanied by the shift of local tissue microbiomes from a ''healthy'' to ''diseased'' profile. 33 Since the 1890s, lactobacilli have been recognized as the gatekeepers of a healthy vaginal ecosystem and it is likely that if this balance is dis-rupted, the vulvovaginal tissue will lack the ability to make balanced and appropriate responses to pathogens such as noncommensal yeasts leading to recurrent infections after the onset of vulvodynia.\nIt remains to be determined whether recurrent yeast infections themselves, or the self-initiated treatments for the infections, play a role in predisposing toward vulvodynia or recurrent onset of yeast infections as a consequence of the development of vulvodynia. However, both are biologically plausible. Other limitations in our data, beyond that of selfreported nondifferential and differential misclassification which we have tried to address in this report, may be the impact of recall between cases and controls irrespective of whether they recall accurately their yeast infection history. To some extent this is taken into account in our bias analyses. In the postonset models, cases had on average 2 years less follow-up time to report the development of yeast infections compared to controls (women without vulvodynia), which may have led to an underestimation of this association. Furthermore, our study is restricted to women with and without vulvodynia with no active infections at the time of the clinical examination. We excluded 17 potential cases and 4 potential controls due to an active yeast infection at the time of the clinical examination. However, given that women with, compared to women without, vulvodynia are likely to experience a greater number of yeast infections, excluding women at the time of the clinical examination due to active infections may have preferentially skewed our cases toward those less likely to suffer from yeast infections. This would then have underestimated our observed associations. We also conducted our bias analysis using values from the literature, but were restricted based on the limitations imposed by the size of our study regarding the lowest possible sensitivities and specificities that could be explored. We note that the values for specificity, in particular, are higher than what has been published in the literature.

PCOS is associated with excess weight gain, which, in turn, exacerbates the health burden of PCOS. Therefore, weight management, including a modest weight loss, maintenance of weight loss, prevention of weight gain, and prevention of excess gestational weight gain, is a first-line treatment for women with PCOS during and independent of pregnancy. Despite evidence-based guidelines, international position statements, and Cochrane reviews promoting lifestyle interventions for PCOS, the optimal complexity, intensity, and behavioral components of lifestyle interventions for women with PCOS are not well understood. The focus of this narrative review is the evidence supporting the use of behavioral strategies in weight management interventions for reproductive-aged women to apply to PCOS. Behavioral theories, behavior change strategies, and psychological correlates of weight management have been thoroughly explored in weight loss interventions in the general population, reproductive-aged women, and peri-natal women. This article uses this parallel body of research to inform suggestions regarding lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS. Outcomes of weight management programs in women with PCOS are likely to be improved with the inclusion of behavioral and psychological strategies, including goal setting, self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and relapse prevention.

[8][9][10] This has expanded the definition of PCOS from the older National Institute of Health (NIH) expert opinion criteria of androgen excess and ovulatory dysfunction 11 to include two additional categories of women with a milder reproductive presentation. PCOS is associated with excess weight gain, which, in turn, exacerbates the health burden. Prevention of excess weight gain and achieving and maintaining modest weight loss are key aspects of its management and improved reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health. Women with PCOS are, therefore, in need of targeted lifestyle prevention and management. The behavioral components of weight loss interventions are critical to increasing participation and compliance and minimizing attrition.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lifestyle and Behavioral Management of PCOS: Overview and Rationale", "text": "PCOS is underpinned by intrinsic insulin resistance, present in 75% of lean and 95% of overweight and obese women, that is further exacerbated by obesity. 12 The prevalence and severity of PCOS are exacerbated by obesity, 13 with one unit increase in body mass index increasing the risk of PCOS by 9%. 2 Women with PCOS are also at a higher 10-year weight gain compared with controls in longitudinal communitybased studies. 2 Importantly, a modest weight loss of 5%-10% significantly mitigates its reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features, including central adiposity, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, quality of life, depression, glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia and inflammation, as demonstrated in primary research and a Cochrane review. [14][15][16][17] Although this Cochrane review contained no data on clinical fertility outcomes, additional studies in PCOS reported that modest weight loss (>5% initial body weight) is associated with an increase in spontaneous pregnancies and live births. 18,19 Weight management, defined as prevention of excess weight gain, modest weight loss, or maintenance of a reduced weight, through lifestyle (diet, physical activity) behavioral interventions is a primary first-line treatment strategy in PCOS recommended by evidence-based guidelines. 16,20 Although it has been proposed that the new milder categories of PCOS introduced by the Rotterdam criteria may not experience the same burden of obesity and cardiometabolic risk as the severe categories defined by the NIH criteria, the Rotterdam criteria are now internationally accepted and insulin resistance is present across all the diagnostic criteria independent of, but worsened by, adiposity and central adiposity. 21 Weight management strategies should, therefore, apply to all women with PCOS regardless of reproductive diagnostic phenotype.\nWomen with PCOS have high (up to 50%) attrition in weight loss studies 16 compared with 31% in the general population (n = 80 studies, aggregated n = 26,455 22 ). An identical 4-month diet intervention had 45% drop-out rates for PCOS, compared with 9% for the general population. 23 Long-term weight management may be more difficult in PCOS due to the higher risk of obesity 24 and longitudinal weight gain, 2 psychological dysfunction, 25 hormonal abnormalities such as hyperinsulinemia, and hyperandrogenism affecting abdominal fat deposition 26 or altered appetite regulation. 27 Worsened weight management in PCOS may also relate to other underlying psychological mechanisms affecting trial adherence, such as depression, anxiety, body image disturbance, and disordered eating, given the higher prevalence of psychological concerns such as anxiety and depression and body image issues in PCOS. 3,28 Although lifestyle intervention can achieve weight loss in the short term in controlled clinical settings, there are limited data assessing the success and sustainability of these strategies in the long term in PCOS. This is relevant given that <10% of the general population maintain a clinically meaningful weight loss in the long term. 29 In PCOS specifically, a Cochrane re-view reported a maximum of 6.8 -3.8 kg weight loss over 3-12 months 16 but included only one long-term (>12 month) study (n = 13, 46% attrition). 30 This was also the only study to use lifestyle interventions containing behavioral components (although the complexity and intensity of strategies were not described). 30 There is, therefore, a need for the development and implementation of weight management interventions incorporating appropriate behavioral strategies in PCOS.\nBehavioral theories, strategies for behavior change, and psychological correlates of weight management have been explored more widely in lifestyle and behavioral weight loss interventions in the general population, in reproductive-aged women, and in pregnancy.

Population weight gain is the result of a small positive energy balance over time. 31 It has been proposed that a modest change approach, including changes that do not reach optimal diet and activity recommendations but may be more easily maintained, may be enough to prevent excess energy balance and gradual weight gain. 32 With regards to weight loss, interventions aim at achieving negative energy balance. This can be through promoting dietary changes (reducing energy intake via reduced energy density, reduced food volume, and/or adjusted macronutrient balance). It can also include physical activity changes (increasing energy expenditure via increased structured aerobic or resistance exercise, increased incidental activity, and/or reduced sedentary time). However, few individuals maintain this weight loss, which is largely attributed to biological factors (e.g., fat storage capacity, reward pathways) that function to maintain the individual's highest body weight by reducing energy expenditure and increasing hunger. 33 These drivers are particularly powerful in an environment that encourages overeating and inactivity. 34 In addition, behavioral (e.g., selfmonitoring) and cognitive (e.g., realistic weight loss goals and perceived self-efficacy of weight loss maintenance) factors may also be important for weight maintenance. 35 ", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Behavioral and Psychological Correlates of Weight Management", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Behavioral and psychological correlates of weight management in general population", "text": "Weight gain prevention has received little research attention. Research suggests that making small behavioral changes, including taking an extra 2000 steps/day, 36 taking stairs instead of escalators, 37 having cereal for breakfast, 38 or replacing sugar-sweetened with artificially sweetened drinks, 39 can reduce gradual longitudinal weight gain. There is also support for low-fat diets, eating more fruits and vegetables, eating less take-away meals, and self-monitoring. 40 Qualitative research reports that the behavioral and psychological correlates of healthy weight maintainers include monitoring weight/shape, flexible eating, regular exercise habits, stress management, and social support. 41 This is consistent with research exploring correlates of weight loss.\nAlthough behavioral and psychological correlates of weight loss and maintenance have received more attention, few consistent findings have emerged. Fewer previous weight loss attempts, autonomy and self-motivation, self-esteem, body image, outcome expectancy, weight-related quality of life, exercise and eating self-efficacy, but not mood (e.g., depression) and eating behaviors/cognitions (e.g., restraint, disinhibition, binge eating), are associated with weight loss. 42 Consistent mediators of weight loss success include higher self-regulation, processes of change, and decisional balance self-efficacy in the short term and autonomous motivation in the long term. Inconsistent mediators include higher body image, cognitive restraint, and lower eating disinhibition and perceived hunger in the short term and higher self-regulation, body image, self-efficacy, flexible cognitive restraint, and outcome expectancies in the long term. 43 Similar variables are also associated with attrition from weight loss intervention. Younger age, lower education, more previous weight loss attempts, greater body dissatisfaction, lower physical activity, poorer mental health, lower self-efficacy, lower social support, higher weight loss expectations, and lower initial weight loss are associated with an increased risk of attrition. 44,45 In The Diabetes Prevention Program, weight loss was associated with older age, later overweight onset, fewer weight loss attempts, exercise self-efficacy, dietary restraint, low-fat diet behaviors, and more sedentary time. 46 Dietary monitoring frequency, fat intake reduction, and achievement of physical activity goals (i.e., at least 150 minutes/week) were associated with weight loss, and early behavior changes and weight loss were strong predictors of long-term weight loss. These findings support the use of intensive initial behavioral intervention. 47,48 The National Weight Control Registry provides information regarding psychosocial and behavioral correlates of weight maintenance after significant weight loss. This includes 3000 registrants (80% women, 97% Caucasian) who have lost at least 30 lb (13.6 kg), the majority using lifestyle/behavioral methods, and maintained this for at least 12 months. Registrants typically weigh themselves regularly, eat less than 1500 kcal/day, eat five times/day, eat breakfast regularly, and exercise regularly. 49,50 Compared with weight re-gainers, weight loss retainers were more likely to maintain physical activity and monitor their diet. 49,50 Weight maintenance is associated with lower levels of depression, disinhibition, binge eating, longer duration of weight maintenance (i.e., > compared with <2 years), and smaller initial weight loss (i.e., <30% compared with >30% of highest weight); maintaining weight loss for >2 years was the best predictor of ongoing weight maintenance. 49,50 A systematic review identified unrealistic weight loss goals, poor coping or problem-solving abilities, low weight-maintenance self-efficacy, lack of vigilance, binge eating, dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger as potential contributors to weight regain. 51 ", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Behavioral and psychological correlates of weight management in reproductive-aged women", "text": "As PCOS is typically first identified and targeted for treatment in reproductive-aged women, weight management research in this group can inform PCOS interventions. Higher attrition is reported in weight loss interventions for both women and younger participants. 52 Longitudinal population studies also report increased weight gain in young women (18-44 years). 53,54 In Australia, young women (18-23 years) gained more weight (6.32 kg) over longitudinal follow-up (8-10 years) than mid-aged (3.43 kg) or older women (weight loss of 1.69 kg). 54 These results are supported by the NHANES. 53 Younger women may experience greater difficulties with weight management related to critical life transitions, including young adulthood, pregnancy, the post-partum period, and perimenopause. This greater longitudinal weight gain and poor program adherence and weight loss is proposed to be related to increased family and time commitments; lack of motivation, childcare, time and support; increased prevalence of physical inactivity; and pregnancy-associated weight gain and retention. [54][55][56] There is limited research specifically examining psychological or behavioral factors related to weight management, attrition, or compliance in reproductive-aged women. In qualitative research in women aged 18-50 years undergoing a 12-month weight gain prevention intervention, the initiation and continuation of positive behavior change was likely to be facilitated by factors such as internal motivation and selfefficacy. 57 A reduced score on the appearance evaluation subscale and body image satisfaction score was associated with a prior weight loss of 10 lb (4.5 kg) or more in a subset of n = 1143 black women aged 24-42 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. 58 In n = 203 women aged 17-37 years randomized to a general or prescriptive weight loss intervention over 12 weeks, attrition was related to a greater baseline internal weight locus of control, psychological distress, and higher food cravings. 59 In a qualitative examination in women aged 25-45 years undergoing an 18 week intervention, self-motivation and internal factors, including self-regulation, were identified as behavioral facilitators or barriers to weight loss and maintenance. 60 The limited literature, therefore, suggests that behavioral or psychological factors may play a role in determining the success of a weight management intervention in young women.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Behavioral and psychological correlates of weight management in pregnancy", "text": "The beginning of pregnancy is a critical time for the health of the mother and her child. The key peri-conception health challenge currently in many countries is the rise in obesity. Half of women entering pregnancy are either overweight or obese. [61][62][63] Critically, around 60% of women have excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and *65% have post-partum weight retention 1 year after giving birth, by which time 20% who entered pregnancy at normal weight are overweight or obese, and 40% starting as overweight are now obese. 62,64 Excessive GWG places the mother and baby at an increased risk of pregnancy and birth-related complications, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and instrumental and operative delivery. 64,65 Infants born to mothers with excessive GWG are also at an increased risk for higher weight across the lifespan: large for gestational age or macrosomia at birth, 66 and overweight and obesity during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, [67][68][69] which are independently exacerbated by excess GWG. 61 Given the association of PCOS with an increased prevalence of pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and large-for-gestational-age babies, 9,10 this highlights the importance of optimizing GWG for pregnant women with PCOS.\nThere is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to assist optimal weight gain during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a time where women are believed to be motivated to be healthy for the benefit of their unborn baby. 70 However, more than 30 interventions have been conducted since 2000 71 and it is reported that traditional behavior and lifestyle change approaches, such as education and advice alone, lack efficacy. 72 The majority of previous behavior change interventions aimed at preventing excessive GWG focused primarily on diet and physical activity, neglecting other important psychological, social, and health behavior change factors 73,74 such as weight gain expectations, eating attitudes, depression, stress, body image, coping skills, and social support. 74 Women's weight gain expectations more strongly predict GWG than their weight gain desires. 75 This may be because women who experience excessive GWG are more likely to overestimate the minimum amount of weight gain needed to have a healthy baby and knowledge of GWG is strongly associated with actual gain. 75 Furthermore, women who exceed GWG recommendations report ''eating for two'' whereas women achieving appropriate GWG are more likely to report modest or no increases in energy calories. 76 These findings suggest that women set themselves up to gain excessively by taking an attitude that fosters enabling of behaviors associated with higher GWG.\nThe limited research exploring the relationships between other psychological factors and GWG reports depressive symptoms, and disorders are associated with both excessive 77 and lower GWG. 78 Stress, but not anxiety, is also associated with inadequate GWG. 79,80 Low levels of social support may place women at an increased risk of higher GWG, 81 and the use of positive coping strategies, such as acceptance of issues or problems, is associated with lower GWG. 82 It is argued that coping ability mitigates the effects of pregnancy-induced stress, leading to improved health and energy-balance-related behaviors and, ultimately, healthy GWG. 83 There is more research examining the association between body image and GWG with overall body dissatisfaction 84,85 and feeling less attractive earlier in pregnancy and feeling less fat in late pregnancy associated with higher or excessive GWG. 86 Further research is needed to better understand the influence of psychosocial factors of weight management during pregnancy. Readers may refer to Table 1 for a synthesis of psychological correlates in the general population, reproductive aged women, and in pregnancy.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lifestyle and Behavioral Management of Obesity", "text": "Diet and physical activity are key components of lifestyle interventions for weight management and can achieve short-term behavior change and weight loss. However, improvements are rarely maintained. Behavioral weight loss interventions are informed by classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning theories. 87 They typically include self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, strategies targeting motivation, social support, coping skills, and psychological well-being and relapse prevention strategies aimed at improving unhelpful eating and activity behaviors. 87,88 The implementation and intensity of behavior change strategies varies across studies, and they are difficult to determine due to poor intervention description. 88 Although behavioral weight loss interventions would be expected to be informed by behavioral theory and use more intensive behavioral interventions than lifestyle interventions, the two terms are often used interchangeably in the literature. 89 Lifestyle and behavioral management of obesity in the general population Although lifestyle and behavioral interventions achieve clinically significant short-term weight loss (5%-10% of initial weight), long-term weight regain generally occurs. 29 The addition of behavioral strategies, and the use of more intensive behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions, are associated with improved initial weight loss and delayed weight regain. However, they do not prevent eventual weight regain. Behavioral interventions focus on modifying health behaviors via making changes to the antecedents and consequences of behaviors to reduce energy intake or increase energy expenditure. Strategies include goal setting and stimulus control. Cognitive behavioral focus is on modifying behaviors and cognitions that are believed to be maintaining unhealthy behaviors. Strategies include cognitive restructuring and motivational interviewing. 90 A Cochrane review of psychological interventions for weight loss included predominantly behavioral (83%) and cognitive behavioral (11%) interventions. Behavioral interventions were more effective than no treatment (Mean difference [MD] -2.5 kg), and the combination of behavioral and/or cognitive behavioral (MD -4.9 kg) interventions with diet and physical activity was more effective than diet or physical activity alone. Higher-intensity behavioral interventions resulted in greater weight loss (MD -2.3 kg). 88 These and other similar findings demonstrate the benefits of adding behavioral therapy to diet and exercise interventions. 22,91 A Systematic reviews have examined the impact of behavioral intervention components (e.g., goal setting, selfmonitoring) on weight loss. Diet and physical activity goal setting and self-monitoring are associated with greater weight loss, weight maintenance and prevention, reduced energy intake, increased energy expenditure, 92,93 and improved psychological outcomes (e.g., dietary restraint, body satisfaction, and depressive symptoms). 94 Frequent self-monitoring is associated with weight loss; however, the optimal duration and frequency is unknown. 93,94 Stimulus control (i.e., making environmental changes to promote positive behavior change) is also a core component of behavioral weight loss interventions. Monetary contingency contracting is associated with greater retention and weight loss during treatment, but not with retention or weight loss post-treatment. 95 Single studies have demonstrated weight loss benefits for various other stimulus control strategies, including eating frequency 96 and food provision. 97 However, there is limited research examining the impact of individual behavioral strategies.\nThese results suggest that the addition of behavioral interventions to diet and physical activity further improves weight loss and delays weight regain. These findings are the basis of international obesity management guidelines highlighting the importance of diet (e.g., eating behavior, diet quality, energy intake), physical activity (e.g., physical activity, sedentary time), and behavioral (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting, POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME 839 Young adults (18-35 years) are underrepresented in traditional intensive weight loss programs. However, higher attrition (67% vs. 95%), poorer adherence (52% vs. 74%), and weight loss (-4.3 vs. -7.7 kg) are reported compared with older adults. 99 There is also limited research assessing weight loss or weight gain prevention in young women. In a recent systematic review of eight studies of moderate-to-poor quality, significant weight loss was reported for the intervention compared with the control group for nearly two third of the studies. However, variability in study interventions makes it difficult to identify successful program components to translate to clinical interventions. 100 In additional weight loss research, a program in young adults reported that an individualized behavioral, dietary, and physical activity weight loss program resulted in 6.6 kg weight loss and 88% completion rate over 20 weeks. 99 This program modified previous interventions to incorporate greater focus on self-monitoring, reduced program intensity (11 sessions over 20 weeks), and tailoring of session content to incorporate issues relevant to this age group (e.g., fast food and alcohol consumption, time management, social eating). 99 Conversely, in n = 203 young women (age 17-37 years) randomized to a general or prescriptive weight loss intervention over 12 weeks, prescriptive advice was associated with greater weight loss (4.2 -0.4 vs. 0.6 -0.2 kg, p < 0.001) but greater attrition (48% vs. 31%, p < 0.05). 59 These conflicting findings highlight the difficulty in reconciling program efficacy, clinically meaningful weight loss, program effectiveness, and translatability.\nThe difficulty that young adults may experience in weight loss interventions also reinforces the focus toward weight gain prevention as a preferred obesity management strategy in this high-risk group. A community-based model may be a preferable approach for weight gain prevention, as primary healthcare involvement is less necessary in the absence of chronic disease. Community-based approaches to fostering healthy lifestyles form part of an overall, multi-pronged approach to obesity prevention. 101 These include the Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP-her), which is a low-intensity, community-based lifestyle intervention that is designed to prevent weight gain in women of childbearing age. 102 The 4month intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and incorporated goal setting, self-monitoring, social support, problem solving, and relapse prevention training. Both short-(4 months) and long-term (12 months) outcomes were positive, with intervention group women reporting no weight gain compared with weight gain in a comparison group that received a single lecture-style healthy lifestyle education session. 102 On expansion of this program to a rural setting involving 649 reproductive-aged women across 41 Australian towns, 103 participants who successfully initiated and continued behavior change (to prevent weight gain) reported realistic program expectations, applied program messages readily, reported high intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and self-awareness, and perceived minimal environmental and social barriers in qualitative research. 57 These findings sug-gest that promoting women's motivation and self-efficacy, and reducing socio-contextual barriers may help promote healthy weight. 43 ", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lifestyle and behavioral management of obesity in pregnancy", "text": "Pregnancy-related lifestyle and behavioral interventions have targeted prevention of excess GWG, and reduction of postpartum weight retention. Hill et al. 74 meta-analyzed behavior change techniques associated with effective GWG interventions, and found that the provision of information, motivational interviewing, self-monitoring, providing rewards contingent on successful behavior (e.g., encouragement for meeting physical activity goals), and goal setting (although the ideal goal types, timing and context as not yet clear) appear to be key strategies. 104 Although it is possible that behavior change techniques can be used to prompt women to higher levels of motivation, the psychosocial (e.g., depression, stress, body image, social support, coping skills) and cognitive (e.g., knowledge of and attitudes about GWG) factors outlined earlier may influence a woman's motivation and confidence to manage diet and physical activity behaviors. 105 HeLP-her was expanded to an antenatal intervention delivered during pregnancy for women at risk of developing gestational diabetes. 106 To our knowledge, it is the only community-based approach to preventing excessive GWG that has been conducted. The antenatal intervention was successful at promoting lower total GWG (to 28 weeks' gestation) and reducing postpartum weight retention (at 6 weeks postpartum) when compared with the single-session comparison group. 106 This suggests promise for communitybased interventions in preventing excessive GWG. These should be collaborative and multi-center in approach, capitalize on existing social connections, and motivate women to be active agents in their own behavior change.\nThe management of obesity during pregnancy and postpartum should also include the provision of support to optimize the uptake of breastfeeding as it is associated with postpartum weight loss, 107 in addition to reduced maternal risk of breast malignancy, 108 improvements in risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, 109 and infant health benefits. 110 However, breastfeeding continuation is challenging, with <50% of Australian women reporting any breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum, 111 which is further worsened in obesity. 112 A combined education and support program delivery with an individual or group approach may improve breastfeeding uptake and continuation, as reported in a recent systematic review. 113 ", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lifestyle and Behavioral Management of Obesity in Women with PCOS: Existing and Proposed Models and Clinical Implications", "text": "Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for weight management and models of care in PCOS state that lifestyle management should be recommended for general health benefits, prevention of excess weight gain, and modest weight loss. 20 Lifestyle management is also important to highlight for lean women with PCOS given that longitudinal weight gain is higher 2 and that weight gain prevention programs are less clinically intensive.

This should incorporate both a specific structured weight loss component and a separate phase focusing on weight maintenance. Successful structured weight loss programs exist in PCOS that report weight loss of 4.2-7.7 kg over 3-12 months and improvements in body composition, reproductive hormones, menstrual cyclicity and ovulation, insulin resistance, risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, quality of life, and self-esteem. 23,117 Although these interventions are effective for intervention completers, high attrition is commonly reported with drop-out rates of up to 46%. 16 These programs focused solely on dietary or physical activity counseling and prescriptions with either no behavioral component or an undefined behavioral component delivered by a dietitian or an exercise physiologist. 30 Outcomes are likely to be improved with the inclusion of behavioral and psychological strategies. These should include goal setting, self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, problem solving and relapse prevention, target improved motivation, social support, coping skills, and psychological well-being and also include behavioral change techniques such as motivational interviewing, selfmonitoring, and time-management strategies. PCOS management may also require differing health expertise in a shared interdisciplinary healthcare model, including referral to allied health professionals such as psychologists, dietitians, or exercise physiologists, where appropriate, based on individual presentation and circumstances. 20 In the context of pregnancy, this model of care would also benefit from midwives assisting in implementation of lifestyle management. Prior research highlighted that midwives see themselves as central in providing lifestyle behavior education to pregnant women, 118 and the majority provide counseling on GWG, diet, and physical activity. 119 As previously discussed, the consideration of appropriate support for optimizing breastfeeding uptake and continuation is also crucial given that obesity is associated with poorer breastfeeding success and that obesity is increased in PCOS. 112 Although breastfeeding has been previously proposed to be further worsened in PCOS, 120 a recent community-based cohort study reported that obesity but not PCOS status was independently related to breastfeeding success. 121 A specific structured weight maintenance and prevention of weight gain approach is also required in women with PCOS who are not overweight or obese, consistent with the previously reported Help-Her approach. This was also achieved with minimal attrition (10%) and low program intensity (four sessions over 12 months). This is consistent with weight management research focusing on young adults that previously reported that reduced program intensity is preferable beyond 3 months in this age group. 99 This is also consistent with the PCOS guidelines that recommend the use of behavioral change techniques for prevention of weight gain. 20 Evidence-based guidelines for the Assessment and Management of PCOS 20 also provide guidance on the optimal dietary composition of lifestyle management. Dietary compositions such as higher protein or lower glycemic index approaches have received increasing interest in PCOS due to their beneficial effects on weight loss or maintenance [122][123][124] related to potential beneficial effects on satiety. 125,126 However, the systematic review that informed the guidelines identified five studies that assessed either monounsaturated fatty acid enriched, low carbohydrate, low glycemic index, or high protein diets or diets consistent with standard healthy eating principles. 127 Weight loss improved the features of PCOS regardless of dietary composition in the majority of studies, and the guidelines recommended that healthy food choices should be used irrespective of diet composition for weight loss (Level C evidence-Body of evidence provides some support for recommendations but care should be taken in its application) or prevention of weight gain (Level D Evidence-Body of evidence of weak and recommendation must be applied with caution).

It is a complex trait with significant environmental and genetic influences that are likely to affect disease expression. 2,3 A number of menstrual and reproductive factors are suggested as risk factors or markers for endometriosis, such as earlier age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, heavier menstrual volume, and nulliparity. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] A link between use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and endometriosis is still uncertain. Researchers have observed an increased risk, 12 a protective effect, 13 and even no association 14 between OC and endometriosis. It has been suggested that up to 50% of infertile women have endometriosis; however, a causal link has not yet been demonstrated. 7,15 Environmental and lifestyle factors are also suggested as risk factors or markers for risk. Although studies have indicated an inverse relationship between endometriosis and body mass index (BMI), [16][17][18][19] there is no consensus as to whether a lean body type is a cause of, or a result of, the disease. Furthermore, one recent study has suggested a positive association between endometriosis and BMI during late childhood. 20 Coffee consumption and smoking have also shown diverse associations with endometriosis. One study reported an increased risk 21 whereas another failed to show any association between coffee and endometriosis. 22 Smoking has shown to be either protective 23,24 or not to be associated with the disease. 25,26 A meta-analysis indicated an association between alcohol consumption and endometriosis. 27 ", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study Aim and Objective", "text": "Despite the high prevalence of morbidity and healthcare costs, risk factors or markers for endometriosis remain largely unknown.

Question concerning level of education was ''What is the highest education you have undergone/are undergoing, how many years in total.'' Weight and height were reported at interview and these measures were used to calculate BMI (kg/m 2 ). Information on parity (''Number of children'') was also requested. Regular use of OC pills solely for contraception was questioned and this variable was used in analysis. We also investigated ''Do you take hormones as the pill because of menstrual pain'' to distinguish from the use for contraceptive purpose. Information on infertility was ascertained with the question, ''Have you been investigated or treated for infertility?'' Coffee consumption was assessed by the question, ''How many cups of coffee do you drink on average per day?'' (do not drink/drink sometime, 1-2 cups, 3-4 cups, or 5 or more cups per day). Cigarette smoking and use of snuff were calculated according to an algorithm based on survey questions, whether they smoked or used snuff regularly, sometimes, or did not use.

Typically, responding women were more than 40 years old with menarche at 13 years of age. The majority of women had a normal BMI, with parity of two or more children and did not use OC regularly. Infertility was more common among cases than among noncases. Almost 80% of women consumed coffee daily, less than 50% smoked regularly, and alcohol consumption was moderate.

An inverse association between OC and endometriosis was found, however, not statistically significant in the adjusted analysis.\nThe findings of an inverse relationship between late age at menarche and endometriosis are in line with findings from previous published studies. 8,10 The majority of previous studies have reported that early menarche (<11 years) increases the risk of endometriosis. 4,7,[33][34][35] Most of these studies have been based on small sample sizes, and they did not find a linear trend always. In some studies higher levels of estradiol 36,37 and estrone 37 have been observed among adult women who had early age at menarche. Evidence shows that estradiol plays an important role in the development of endometriosis, [38][39][40] which may explain that higher early exposure to estrogen caused by early age at menarche may cause an increased risk for endometriosis.\nConsistent with other published studies, an inverse association with endometriosis was shown for parity with two or more children 7,9,11,40,41 and also a strong association between infertility and endometriosis. 41,42 Parity may be inversely associated with endometriosis in this study because of reverse causation. We speculate that women who have endometriosis are less fertile and are thus less likely to end up having two or more children. The hypothesis that endometriosis causes infertility or a decrease in fecundity remains, however, controversial. It is not clear whether endometriosis and infertility share a common cause or whether infertility is in the etiological pathway to endometriosis. 41 During the use of OC, ovulation is suppressed and the amount of menstrual bleeding is reduced, making OC an effective treatment option for endometriosis. Considering this mechanism, the use of OC might have the potential to also prevent the development of endometriosis; however, this could not be shown in our study. The possibility of a link between use of OC and endometriosis has long been a matter of debate. Studies have shown previous use of OC to be associated with endometriosis later in life, 12,43 whereas ", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RISK FACTORS FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS 155", "text": "others have reported a protective effect 13,44 or could not find any association between use of OC and endometriosis. 5,14 The diversity of findings can be explained by several factors. In previous studies, the indications for OC use as well as the durations of treatment vary between individuals, making interpretation difficult. In our study, only women using OC solely for contraceptive purpose were considered as OC users in the analysis. Although our results pointed toward a protective effect, the association did not remain significant when other risk factors/markers were considered. Our results thus neither support nor oppose the use of OC for primary prevention of endometriosis. Among women in our study, we could not find an association between smoking and the risk for endometriosis. Our study is in line with a previous large meta-analysis 25 and other studies 6,17,26,45 and further strengthens that there is no association between smoking and endometriosis.\nWe observed no association between BMI and endometriosis, which is inconsistent with previous studies. Others have observed a positive 20 or inverse 16,17,19,46 association between BMI and endometriosis. This discrepancy could be because of lack of information regarding BMI before the onset of the disease. Nagle et al. 20 collected data on BMI when women were 10-16 years of age, whereas Shah et al. 18 in their large prospective study used the BMI reported by women both at the time of data collection and when they were 18 years of age. In our study, we asked for the information of BMI at the time of interview, and most women probably had a lower BMI at younger age, since BMI usually increases with age. 47 We are concerned about the possibility of recall bias and reverse causation because of our study design. That may be a reason why we did not observe association between BMI and endometriosis. However, the biological mechanisms behind a possible association are not clear and further work should focus on elucidating underlying biological relationships that contribute directly to the initiation and promotion of endometriosis in association with different BMIs.\nThis study showed no association between consumption of coffee and endometriosis, after adjustment for other risk factors/markers. Our result is consistent with the result of a recent meta-analysis 22 and further strengthens the result of no association between coffee consumption and endometriosis. We observed no meaningful association between alcohol consumption and risk for endometriosis. One recent metaanalysis concluded that alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk for endometriosis. 27 The limitation of this is that it is impossible to evaluate whether alcohol exposure preceded the development of endometriosis.

Previous large studies have examined in total 116,678 females with 1,766 endometriosis cases 7 and 17,032 women with 313 endometriosis cases. 44 Other studies were small including a total of 512-976 women with 168-410 endometriosis cases. 10,12 This study also has limitations, which should be considered. It is a cross-sectional study where information was collected at one time point with no follow-up, which probably affected the prevalence of endometriosis. Reverse causality bias may be introduced in cross-sectional studies because exposure is ascertained at the same time point as the outcome. As the delay in diagnosis of endometriosis can be 7-10 years, it is difficult to report the timing of exposure in a retrospective survey. Consequently, because the true time sequence of events is unknown, we cannot ascertain that the exposure preceded the outcome. Furthermore, diagnostics criteria for endometriosis have varied during the years, a fact that might have contributed to underdiagnoses especially among women who were diagnosed before surgical confirmation became a requirement for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Self-reported age at menarche may be uncertain, but it would have the same impact also on the control group. One problem with all studies on endometriosis is to assure that the nondiseased group is free of endometriosis and the impossibility of knowing the exact onset of disease, as opposed to the date of diagnosis. 7 There is also a possibility of recall bias, even if we tried to limit recall bias through the use of a highly structured questionnaire.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our cross-sectional study of a large population-based twin sample revealed inverse association of endometriosis with reproductive factors such as late age at menarche and parity with two or more children.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-three women (age range 19-32) participated in the study. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (TT), and free androgen index (FAI) were measured. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) questionnaires were used to assess sexual function and distress, respectively.

This has resulted in improved tolerability of COCs. 2 On the other hand, current COCs could negatively modify the sexual activity of women by increasing the androgen-binding protein and producing hypoandrogenism. [3][4][5] This could decrease sexual desire in COC users, 6 even if not all authors have reported significant changes. 7 Furthermore, vaginal dryness could be due to the excessive low EE dosage, with consequent arousal disorder. [8][9][10] Today, contraceptive counseling is aimed at improving acceptability of a COC not only as a method chosen to avoid pregnancy but also having neutral or positive effects on the sexual function of women. 11,12 The use of estrogens and progestogens that show a greater resemblance to endogenous hormones represents the most recent advance in COC development. New pills contain 17bestradiol (E2) and have fewer adverse effects than EE. 13 The use of E2 in combination with progestogen could further improve tolerability and minimize the effects of EE on hepatic metabolism. 14,15 In fact, E2 has less effect on hepatic protein synthesis than EE and has more favorable lipid and hemostatic profiles. 16,17 Recently, a new COC containing 1.5 mg E2 with 2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC/E2) has been used with a 24/4 regimen, meaning 24 days of active pill use, followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval. 18 NOMAC has a long half-life (45-50 hours) compared with other contraceptive progestins; consequently, its contraceptive efficacy could be more forgiving of missed pill doses than progestins with a shorter half-life. 19 NOMAC/E2 exhibits a neutral to slightly positive effect on acne, which is consistent with its moderate increase of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreased androgen level. 20,21 SHBG is a carrier protein synthesized in hepatocytes; its synthesis has been shown to be highly sensitive to both estrogens and androgens. 22 Currently, EE administered orally in COCs markedly increases SHBG levels in a dosedependent manner, whereas progestogens, due to their antiandrogenic properties, decrease these levels to a varying extent depending on the steroid dose and type. The effect of a COC formulation on SHBG thus appears to reflect the balance between estrogenic and androgenic activities. 23 The effect of NOMAC/E2 on SHBG is relatively low, especially when compared with EE-containing oral contraceptives. 16,24 In contrast to many progestogens, NOMAC is not bound to SHBG, and therefore changes in SHBG levels should not affect pharmacokinetic parameters for NOMAC/E2. 16 While suppression of androgenic activity may be a useful treatment in women with hyperandrogenic symptoms such as acne, on the contrary, it may potentially affect sexual function in healthy women. [25][26][27] The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of NOMAC 2.5 mg/E2 1.5 mg on the sexual health of women on COCs who wanted to discontinue their contraception use due to low sexual desire.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This prospective observational study was performed at the Family Planning Centre of the Research Group for Sexology, Department of General Surgery and Medical Surgical Specialties, School of Medicine, University of Catania, Italy.

A score is calculated for each of the six domains and the total score is obtained summing all the items. The total score range is 2-36. A cutoff of \u00a326.55 is usually accepted for diagnosis of sexual dysfunction in women within a wide age range. 30 Moreover, for diagnosis of sexual dysfunction, an essential element is the requirement that the condition causes significant personal distress for the woman. Therefore, the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) was used. 31 The FSDS consists of 12 items. The maximum score is 48. An FSDS score of \u202115 corresponds to clinically significant distress. We considered women with an FSFI score of less than 26.55 to be affected by sexual dysfunction if they also had an FSDS score of 15 or greater.\nFurthermore, each woman received a diary to record daily sexual activity during treatment, covering behaviors from self-stimulation to arousal with partner and actual intercourse; moreover, the incidence of adverse events, the characteristics of withdrawal and intracyclic bleeding, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), characterized by mental and physical signs and symptoms, such as anxiety, irritability, mood swings, sleep disorders, fatigue, altered interest in sex, breast tenderness, weight gain, headaches, change in appetite, general aches and pain, and feeling bloated, were also recorded.\nBlood samples were obtained from all women during the morning on their current COC intake days 12-17 (baseline) to measure total testosterone (TT, ng/dL), SHBG (nM), and prolactin (PRL, ng/mL) concentrations by ELISA (Elecsys \u00aa Systems 2010; Roche).

Moreover, all progestogens had antiandrogenic activity. The time in which the dysfunction occurred was 3 -2 months after the women started taking the COC.

Mild adverse events were recorded in the diary. At baseline, 21 (25.3%) women on 21/7 COC regimen referred to be affected by abdominal pain, breast tenderness, and mild headache during the 7-day hormone-free interval.

NOMAC/E2 COC was chosen for the types of its sexual steroids. In the current study, SHBG decreased and TT increased in women during the third and sixth cycles of NOMAC/E2 with respect to those measured during the last cycle of previous COC usage. On the contrary, the FAI concentration improved at the two follow-ups. Normally, E2 has less impact on hepatic SHBG synthesis than EE. 17 Studies have shown that NOMAC/E2 induces an *44% increase from baseline in SHBG, 24 significantly lower than the 150% induced by EE/norgestimate, the 400% by EE/ cyproterone acetate, 32 or the 308% by EE/drospirenone. 21 The rise in SHBG induced by NOMAC/E2 is most likely only due to the estrogen component of this combination because NOMAC is nonandrogenic. However, NOMAC (19-norprogesterone-derived progestin) has moderate antiandrogenic activity, approximately five times less than that of cyproterone acetate, two times less than that of dienogest (19 nor-testosterone derived) and drospirenone (spirolactone derived), and similar to that of chlormadinone acetate (17 HO-progesteronederived progestin). 13 The quality of progestin might have played an even greater role, as demonstrated by the fact that TT at baseline was lowest in the women on a COC containing the least amounts of EE combined with drospirenone.\nA current literature review and meta-analysis demonstrated that COCs decrease circulating levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations. 23 Because of the SHBG increase, free T levels decrease twice as much as total T. The estrogen dose and progestin type of the COC do not influence the decline of total and free T, but both affect SHBG.\nHowever, other effects of progestins on sexuality should be taken into consideration, particularly those due to their FIG. 3.

Their mechanism of action, such as interaction with different receptors, could result in an impairment of social behavior and sexual motivation. 33 On the other hand, different combinations of COCs decrease plasma levels of allopregnanolone influencing aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors, which participate in the regulation of a variety of psychological phenomena, including anxiety, sleep, depression, seizures, and sexual dysfunction 34,35 ; moreover, DRSP and chlormadinone are able to reduce anxiety and mood swings. 34,36 The chemical structure of progestins influences their binding affinity with receptors. Because the progestins used in COCs can be derivates of progesterone, testosterone, and spirolactone, they could also bind with other members of the steroid receptor family, exhibiting additional nonprogestagenic biological effects. NOMAC is one of the most selective agonists of the progesterone receptor, with little or no activity for other steroid receptors. 37 From data obtained during our study, we think that the synergic activity of both NOMAC and Estradiol might have promoted general improvement of women's sexuality.\nFinally, other than all the combinations in terms of dose and duration of usage, the route of administration and baseline hormonal status of women could influence sexual health, increasing the complexity of this field.\nCurrently, COCs containing EE and progestin with antiandrogenic properties are widely used for noncontraceptive purposes: to treat chronic pelvic pain, PMS, or hyperandrogenic disorder. 38 Consequently, the reduction of dysmenorrheal, 39 endometriosis-associated pelvic pain 40 or esthetic signs due to hyperandrogenism 41 usually improves the quality of life and sexual health of users on the basis of COC compounds and regimen. 42 On the contrary, when COCs are prescribed for better sexuality, the effects of their high antiandrogenic activity could affect the quality of sexual life. Some authors previously reported the effects of COCs on sexuality on the basis of EE quantity and progestogen type and COC regimen reporting increased intensity of orgasm and frequency of sexual intercourse, [43][44][45] negative changes in sexual desire, 5,46 or reduced vaginal lubrication. 8 Today, some strategies for better COC usage could be taken into consideration to improve a woman's sexual health, such as decreasing dropout, increasing time using effective methods, and/or switching from less dysfunctional to more functional methods. The risk of discontinuation and/or change of contraceptive usage consist in promoting high unplanned pregnancy rates. 47 For all these reasons, new developments in oral contraception are continuing. We have learned not to expect one oral contraceptive to be the solution to all problems. In our experience, COCs containing E2 are an innovation that could help women to not suffer from low sexual desire during hypoandrogenic COC usage.\nConsequently, the concept that all women are different and variably sensitive to COC steroids has to be emphasized; in fact, we are going into an era where the concept of tailoring a COC to a particular woman has to be adopted. Thus, the first step in prescribing a COC is to understand the needs of the subject and to investigate her current sexual health.\nOne of the limits of our study was the small sample size. Moreover, there was no comparative COC group, so NOMAC/E2 usage was uncontrolled. In fact, not all women who are using COCs with high antiandrogenic activity have sexual health dysfunction. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate sexually healthy women to whom COCs were prescribed for the first time, follow them over time, and highlight those who experience a sexual disorder. This means that the study baseline has to coincide with the condition of normal sexual function. Thus, we could also investigate women with sexual FSD during COC treatment having no antiandrogenic activity and/or using an administration route that is not oral. Furthermore, it would be necessary to investigate the role that inducing amenorrhea could have on sexual health.\nIn the near future, randomized trials investigating the effects of long-term COC administration on a larger number of women having sexual side effects from COC will be needed also aiming to study the placebo effects that could take place in the first 6 months of COC usage.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors wish to thank The Scientific Bureau of the University of Catania for language support.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "The authors report no conflicts of interest.

Methods: Data were drawn from the Women's Healthcare Experiences and Preferences Study, an Internet survey of 1,078 women aged 18-55 randomly sampled from a national probability panel. Survey items assessed women's preferences for contraceptive methods, match between methods preferred and used, and perceived reasons for mismatch. We estimated predictors of contraceptive preference with multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Among women at risk for pregnancy who responded with their preferred method (n = 363), hormonal methods (non-LARC [long-acting reversible contraception]) were the most preferred method (34%), followed by no method (23%) and LARC (18%). Sociodemographic differences in contraception method preferences were noted ( p-values <0.05), generally with minority, married, and older women having higher rates of preferring less effective methods, compared to their counterparts. Thirty-six percent of women reported preference-use mismatch, with the majority preferring more effective methods than those they were using. Rates of match between preferred and usual methods were highest for LARC (76%), hormonal (non-LARC) (65%), and no method (65%). The most common reasons for mismatch were cost/insurance (41%), lack of perceived/actual need (34%), and method-specific preference concerns (19%). Conclusion: While preference for effective contraception was common among this sample of women, we found substantial mismatch between preferred and usual methods, notably among women of lower socioeconomic status and women using less effective methods. Findings may have implications for patient-centered contraceptive interventions.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W hile contraceptive methods like long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) are highly effective at preventing unintended pregnancies, high unintended pregnancy rates continue to be a national public health concern. Over half (54%) of U.S. unintended pregnancies are attributed to the 14% of ''at risk'' women who do not use contraception or use it inconsistently. 1,2 Among various factors associated with contraceptive method use and continuation, increasingly, satisfaction appears to be important. 3 In a study of 1,489 women at 65 centers in Europe and South Africa, researchers found that higher satis-faction rates among transdermal patch users were associated with higher adherence rates, compared to oral contraceptive (OC) users, who experienced both lower satisfaction rates and lower adherence rates. 4 The association between satisfaction rates and continuation rates was further demonstrated in the St. Louis Contraceptive CHOICE Project, in which LARC users exhibited both higher satisfaction (80% versus 54%) and continuation rates (86% vs. 55%) compared to OC users. 5 Indeed, the consequences of method dissatisfaction have been consistently described-dissatisfaction leads to discontinuation or switching to a less reliable method, or no method at all. [5][6][7][8] Beyond satisfaction, less research has focused on women's preferences for contraceptive methods. The majority of literature has used choice as a proxy for preference by assuming women are choosing and then using their preferred method. [9][10][11] However, few, if any, studies have comprehensively described the unique construct of contraceptive method preference or estimated whether women are using their preferred methods, and subsequently identified what barriers may preclude preferred method use. One notable preference-based study of U.S. women at high risk of unintended pregnancy identified effectiveness, lack of side effects, and affordability as ''extremely important'' contraceptive features, but did not directly ask participants their preferred contraceptive method. 12 Although method satisfaction has been well researched and associated with method continuation, more research is necessary to elucidate the connections between contraceptive preference, use, and continuation. Ultimately, a better understanding of contraceptive preference is needed to inform patient-centered models of care, promote women's reproductive autonomy, address unmet family planning needs, and inform efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies for women in the United States. [11][12][13][14] We described women's contraceptive method preferences, use, and preference-use mismatch among a sample of reproductive-aged women in the United States and examined sociodemographic factors associated with method preferences and women's reasons for preference-use mismatch.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design and sample", "text": "We analyzed data from the Women's Healthcare Experiences and Preferences Study, our Internet-based survey of 1,078 U.S. women aged 18-55 conducted in September 2013. The study design and sample have been described elsewhere. 15 GfK (Menlo Park, CA) fielded the survey among their national household random probability panel composed of 50,000 U.S. residents aged 13 and older. The GfK panel is sampled by probability-based address mailing (ABS) and random digit dialing (RDD) telephone methods. GfK uses a probability-based sampling of addresses from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File for its ABS sample, and employs list-assisted RDD sampling techniques based on a sample frame of the U.S. residential landline telephone universe for the RDD sample. Oversampling in the RDD sample was conducted in telephone exchanges that had high concentrations of African American and Hispanic households based on census data. Thus, panel members come from listed and unlisted telephone numbers, telephone and nontelephone households, and cell phone-only households, as well as households with and without Internet access.\nPanelists with no Internet connection or computer are provided computer access to participate. Panelists are provided a unique login information and responses are deidentified by GfK. Sociodemographic information is collected and updated to facilitate complex, stratified sampling designs. Incentive points (redeemable for cash, merchandise, gift cards, or game entries) are offered to encourage survey response. Among GfK panelists eligible for inclusion in the larger study (Englishspeaking women ages 18-55), 2,520 were randomly selected and emailed an invitation to participate.\nStatistical weighting was computed in several stages to offset known sample selection deviations and address sources of survey error, including nonresponse due to recruitment methods and panel attrition. These biases were incorporated in the sample's base weight before the sample was drawn, which was then subjected to an iterative raking procedure to calibrate to national demographic benchmarks, including appropriate representation of groups of underrepresented women (i.e., minority women, poor women) (more information on survey methodology can be found at www.knowledgenetworks.com/ ganp/reviewer-info.html). This study was approved by the University of Michigan's Institutional Review Board.\nWe adapted the standard parameters to define our ''at risk'' analytic sample, 16 so that women who were ''at risk'' for unplanned pregnancy were defined as follows: (1) aged 18-44, (2) sexually active with a male partner in the last 12 months, (3) not pregnant in the last 12 months, (4) not trying to get pregnant at the time of the study, (5) and not sterile by noncontraceptive reasons (e.g., hysterectomy).", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "The Women's Healthcare Experiences and Preferences Study survey included 29 items designed to measure women's preferences and experiences with health and healthcare. Information was also collected on sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive and health histories, health behavior and health service behavior intentions, and reproductive healthcare/policy knowledge and attitudes. The survey content was based on our previous work and existing reproductive health surveys (e.g., the National Survey of Family Growth [NSFG]). We piloted the survey among 25 panelists for readability and comprehension before finalization. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the survey was 6.6 and the average completion time was 15 minutes.\nIn this study, we focused on a series of items that measured women's experiences with and preferences for contraceptive methods.\nWomen were first asked, ''What, if any, type of birth control method(s) did you and/or your partner use during your last sexual intercourse?'' In our analysis, ''method used'' was treated as a covariate to characterize method preference. Multiple responses were possible and options included the following: ''intrauterine device (IUD; for example, Mirena or Paragard); implant (for example, Implanon or Nexplanon); pills (for example, Ortho Tri-Cyclen or Yaz); patch (for example, Ortho Evra); ring (for example, Nuvaring); injectable (for example, Depo-Provera shot); condoms; withdrawal (''pulling out''); emergency contraception (''morning after pill''); other barrier methods (for example, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap); other contraceptive method (please specify); or 'We did not use a birth control method at last sex.'''\nWomen who reported tubal ligation or male partner vasectomy in open responses were coded as ''other permanent method.'' Women were top coded to the most effective method reported (e.g., if a woman reported using both ''LARC'' and ''pills,'' they were top coded to the more effective method -''LARC'').\nWe examined method use in multiple ways and present analyses that employed two categorical indicators: a 6-point method variable ( Women were then asked, ''If you could choose any type of birth control METHOD in the future, regardless of cost or other difficulties, what method would you MOST LIKE to use?'' This variable served as our ''preferred method'' outcome. Response options were the same as for the use variable, with the additions of the following: ''I do not need birth control (for example, because I only have sex with women or my male partner is infertile)''; ''I prefer not to use a birth control method''; and ''Don't know.'' We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore different iterations of our outcome variable (6 point, 4 point, binary) and results are similar, so we present the 6-point and 4-point variables for method preference as described above for use.\nFinally, women were asked, ''Are you currently using the type of birth control that you would MOST LIKE to use?'' For those who responded ''No,'' they were asked, ''What is the reason(s) that you are not currently using the type of birth control that you would MOST LIKE to use?'' Response options included a comprehensive list of 14 potential reasons, including an open-ended ''some other reason,'' and women could select multiple reasons. Examples included the following: ''Method is too expensive''; ''Insurance does not cover that method''; ''Health provider will not give you that type of method''; ''Worried about side effects''; ''Don't think you can get pregnant''; ''Don't mind if you get pregnant''; and not having sex regularly.\nWe coded and sometimes collapsed specific reasons into the following ten constructed categories for data management and presentation purposes: (1) cost/insurance (e.g., ''Insurance does not cover that method''), (2) perceived/actual need (e.g., ''Don't think you can get pregnant''), (3) fear of side effects and health concerns (e.g., ''Worried about side effects of birth control''), (4) pregnancy ambivalence (e.g., ''Don't mind if you get pregnant''), (5) access/provider barriers (e.g., ''Health provider will not give you that type of method''), ( 6) contemplation/intention phase (e.g., ''Just started thinking about switching''), ( 7) method-specific preference concerns (e.g., ''Partner does not want you to use that method''), (8) perceived eligibility (e.g., ''Other health problems prevent you from using that method''), ( 9) convenience, and (10) other.\nWe examined all available demographic, social, and reproductive history covariates as ''predictors'' of method preference based upon our prior work, 17 including the following: age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, income level, religious affiliation and service attendance, political party affiliation, type of health insurance, health service use, and pregnancy and childbirth history.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "We applied sampling weights and employed weighted statistical commands in SAS Studio 3.4 (Cary, NC).

Among the third of women who reported mismatch, cost/insurance (41%) and lack of perceived/actual need (34%) were the most commonly reported reasons why women reported that they were not using their preferred method, followed by fear of side effects/health concerns (19%), access/provider-related barriers (13%), pregnancy ambivalence (9%), being in contemplation or intention phase within the contraceptive decision-making process (9%), perceived ineligibility (6%), and method-specific preference concerns (6%).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In our study of women's contraceptive method preference and method preference-use match, we found strong preference for ''effective'' and ''highly effective'' methods and high rates of concordance among LARC (86%), no method (65%), and hormonal (non-LARC) method (65%) users. Others have documented similar results for method satisfaction, with high satisfaction rates among LARC users and satisfaction predicting high continuation and low unintended pregnancy rates among the women who were using and preferring a method. 4,5,8 Notably, 36% of our women reported method preference-use mismatch and mismatch was highest among ''less effective'' method users (e.g., condoms, withdrawal), for women using a method. While choice, satisfaction, and continuation have been more widely studied dimensions of contraceptive decision-making and behavior, our findings build upon this work to highlight the unique contribution of method preference to this contraceptive continuum. [11][12][13][14] Social disparities in contraceptive preference and method preference-use mismatch were noted, with minority women preferring less effective methods compared to White women. Some researchers have documented lower levels of method awareness among minority populations, 18,19 yet others have found LARC use higher in some groups (e.g., Hispanics) when cost and knowledge barriers are removed. 20 For instance, data from the 2011-2013 National Study on Family Growth (NSFG) show higher LARC use in Hispanic populations (15%) versus White (11%) and Black (9%) populations. 21 Nonetheless, our findings in this study regarding less effective method preference may be important in helping explain persistent disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among minority women. Results are from the subsample of 351 women who provided all preferred contraceptive method and sociodemographic data. Results are presented as weighted percentages. p-value from Chi-square comparing method preferred by method used.\n* Missing p-value is due to insufficient cell sizes across permanent and withdrawal/other methods.

Results are from the sub-sample of eligible women that reported a reason for preference-use mismatch (n = 87).\nResults are presented as weighted proportions (%) and frequencies. Numbers may not add to 100% because women could select multiple reasons.\nHere, mismatch was determined by a single survey item explicitly asking women, ''Are you currently using the type of birth control that you would MOST LIKE to use?''", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "698", "text": "HE ET AL.\nIn addition, some lower educated women in this study preferred less effective methods and contraceptive preferenceuse mismatch was particularly high among them, although not in an expected direction-less than 5% of women with less than high school education preferred LARC, while 16% were using it. These estimates were consistent with national estimates from the NSFG (12% of women with less than high school education report using LARC). 21 Scholars have argued that socially disadvantaged women may experience reduced reproductive autonomy in contraceptive decision-making and provision, 14,15,22 and from a reproductive justice perspective, this finding deserves more attention. Young, poor, minority, and undereducated women were underrepresented in our study (which limits our generalizability), and yet these same groups experience the highest rates of unintended pregnancy. 2 Overall, a better understanding of socially disadvantaged women's preferred methods and access to them is urgently needed. Clinical and public health efforts should also consider sources of discrimination in family planning services. Interventions that explicitly account for women's contraception preferences and pregnancy desires in contraceptive education decisionmaking and provision are urgently needed.\nCost/insurance concerns were among the top reasons for contraceptive preference-use mismatch (41%), closely followed by other access and provider-related issues. Financial and health services barriers precluding utilization of highly effective methods have been widely documented. [23][24][25][26][27] With the Affordable Care Act, full insurance coverage of contraceptive methods in the United States has expanded, improving access to LARC and hormonal methods in recent months. 28 Yet, fewer women in our sample reported no insurance (20%), and it is unclear in these data why cost/insurance concerns were so high. It is possible that women's insurance plans in 2013 had been ''grandfathered'' into the system with the healthcare law and were not yet required to cover all methods, or that, there were discrepancies between women's perceived and actual contraception coverage. Indeed, challenges to implementation of mandated contraceptive coverage have impacted both insured and underinsured women's ability to obtain their preferred methods. 29,30 Structural barriers appear to continue impeding women from comprehensive, preferred family planning care.\nMethod-specific concerns and behavioral intentions were also prominent reasons for contraceptive preference-use mismatch. Among women with method-specific concerns (e.g., convenience, fear of side effects/health concerns, perceived ineligibility), the majority (70%) preferred more effective methods than the ones they were using. Indeed, associations between method knowledge/attitudes and satisfaction, choice, and use have been described. 3,9,31 However, the meaning and implications of interrelationships between effectiveness and preference are not clear, given that the CDC effectiveness categories may not reflect a woman's motivation to choose or use a particular contraceptive method for effectiveness alone. Unfortunately, we did not assess women's knowledge of different methods or experiences with counseling in this study, limiting our ability to explore the impact of knowledge or relationships of interest on preference.\nOn the other hand, a nontrivial proportion of women had active intentions to pursue their preferred methods, but had not yet acquired them (e.g., their reported reason for mismatch was ''need to find a doctor to go to'' and were thus coded to ''Still in Contemplation/Intention Phase''), which is a promising finding consistent with behavioral change models. 10,32 Women in ''precontemplation,'' ''contemplation,'' or ''preparation'' stages may be particularly influenced by information from peers, partners, health providers, and others, and thus are prime targets for educational and social network interventions. Indeed, cognitive behavioral models that account for preferences (or some proxy of it) appear useful in intervention research on contraceptive method continuation. A study of postpartum U.S. adolescents indicated a disconnect between intention to continue Depo-Provera at 6 months (80%) postpartum and actual continuation at 12 months (43%), despite high satisfaction with the method. 33 Collectively, contraceptive counseling that addresses method-specific understanding, misperceptions, and benefits and targets women's contraceptive method behavioral intentions may have the potential to facilitate informed contraceptive decision-making and uptake of preferred methods. At the least, clinicians should consider the complex context in which contraceptive decision-making occurs before a woman steps into the exam room.\nOur study has several notable limitations. While our study response rate of 43% (n = 1078) was consistent with other Internet-based population health surveys, it was not ideal. Our sample was derived from a national probability panel and applied sampling weights, but women were more educated, more privately insured, of higher income status, more Caucasian, and older than the general population and were similarly different from nonrespondents. Our subsample sizes for some contraceptive outcomes were small and limited our ability to fully examine differences across individual methods and sociodemographic groups. In addition, our small subsample sizes likely contributed to relatively large effects of some factors associated with women's preference (i.e., reflected in wide confidence intervals). Thus, the true magnitude of effects for these factors would benefit from further investigation. In particular, our findings do not yield firm conclusions about LARC preferences necessarily, given our relatively small sample of women using (n = 42) and preferring (n = 67) LARC.\nWe approximated contraception method choice with women's method at last sexual intercourse, which may differ from their usual method of contraception. Also, our measures for preference and reasons for preference-use mismatch may have not fully captured the complexity of women's experiences. While our preferences question item stem was originally worded in an attempt to best distinguish between methods women are currently using and what they actually prefer, women's ''future'' preferences may not entirely reflect current preference. Although we included an openended response option and attempted to provide a comprehensive list based upon the literature, our reasons for mismatch were likely not exhaustive and may have missed some important factors. 34,35 In addition, while we were interested in sterilization as a method of interest, the meaning of preference among women already sterilized is not fully clear from these data-the prevalence rate for mismatch may reflect regret or that they simply perceived no need and thus have no preference. We adapted the standard parameters to define our ''at risk'' analytical sample, although it is possible that our inclusion CONTRACEPTIVE PREFERENCE-USE MISMATCH criteria had the potential to both erroneously exclude ''at risk'' women, and include women not ''at risk'' for unintended pregnancy. Furthermore, we did not assess women's fertility intentions, which could potentially explain our high rate of preference for ''no method.'' Future research is needed to further examine preferences and presence-use mismatch for nonusers in a broader context of fertility intentions.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Nonetheless, findings suggest that, while perfect match rates between women's preferred and usual contraceptive methods are a lofty goal in current healthcare systems, [17][18] strategies that reduce cost and awareness barriers may improve women's reproductive autonomy, participation in shared decision-making, and ultimately, their access to and use of desired and (highly) effective methods. 19 Even when financial/access/knowledge barriers are reduced, however, women's personal goals for contraceptive methods and family planning may not align with population-level goals, which emphasize contraceptive effectiveness and reducing aggregate unintended pregnancy rates. Healthcare professionals must balance patient autonomy and shared decision-making in contraceptive care with the broader public health agenda.\nAdditional research is needed to understand women's complex reasons for method preference, preference-use mismatch, and disparities across groups. In particular, it is vital for contraceptive counseling interventions to explicitly address women's preferences for contraceptive methods, target groups at risk for mismatch (i.e., minority women, users of less effective methods), and holistically consider the many potential reasons for mismatch within reproductive health service delivery models. Continued efforts to promote universal coverage of the full scope of methods and more robust patient-centered models of contraceptive care can ultimately help women achieve greater concordance between their family planning preferences, aspirations, and outcomes.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Source of Work", "text": "Women's Health Care Experiences and Preferences Survey, a population-based study administered in August 2013 using the GfK (formerly Knowledge Networks) nationally representative probability panel.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Pr\u00e9 cis", "text": "While many women preferred effective and highly effective contraception, mismatch between preferred and usual methods was common.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "", "text": "Author Disclosure Statement V.K.D. has received payments from the University of California, San Francisco, to provide content expertise during the development of a web-based educational program on early pregnancy failure funded by an anonymous donor (2012); has received payments for expert witness work for Bayer (2014,2015); has received a one-time honorarium for participation in an expert advisory panel for Johnson and Johnson.

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were run to accomplish this. Results: In bivariate and multivariate models, living in a household in which adults treated each other violently increased odds of ever receiving a Pap test. In bivariate models, physical and sexual abuse was associated with decreased odds of receiving a recent Pap test. After accounting for confounders, only the latter association remained significant.

Women who adhere to Pap screening recommendations have better cure rates than those who are overdue for screening. 3 Given the importance of Pap tests in the early detection of cervical cancer, it is essential to consider what psychosocial factors are associated with the initial uptake and continued compliance to cervical cancer screening.\nOne potential predictor of cervical cancer screening that has not received adequate attention is the potential impact adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may have on use of Pap tests. These ACEs encompass both child abuse and household dysfunction experienced before the age of 18, such as physical abuse and parental separation. 4 Available research, focusing almost exclusively on sexual abuse, has found that women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse are less likely to receive cervical cancer screenings. 5 This same research showed that experiencing acts of terrorism was not associated with cervical cancer screening. 5 Qualitatively, women who have experienced sexual abuse identified the mechanism of the examination, gender of provider, negative emotions, power disparities, trust, pain, safety and disclosure, communication barriers, and sexual victimization as potential barriers to screening. 6,7 Despite the evidence suggesting sexual abuse is associated with decreased cancer screening, other ACEs remain unexamined.\nThere are several reasons to suspect that ACEs may be associated with cervical cancer screening. First, as evidenced from the findings examining survivors of sexual abuse, exposure to some ACEs may motivate women to eschew screening. 5 This is unsurprising considering the relatively invasive nature of the procedure and when considering that sizable proportions of women believe Pap tests to be painful. 8 Second, experiencing ACEs has been associated with a wide pattern of risky health behaviors that includes alcohol abuse, 9,10 drug use, 11,12 tobacco use, 13 and risky sexual behaviors. 14 In the family context, individuals can adopt these health behaviors as a means of coping with a hostile or cold family environment, or because uninvolved adults are not available to monitor the uptake of these harmful behaviors. 15 Similarly, it is possible that these parents or adults are themselves not receiving screening for cancers, thus modeling negative health behaviors to children around them.\nThird, in the specific context of healthcare utilization, ACEs have been associated with increased utilization of care, partially because these individuals are more likely to be sick. 16 Given that this runs counter to the established findings showing an association between sexual abuse and cervical cancer screening, it is impossible to know if specific ACEs will follow the general pattern seen among health behaviors or if cancer screening will more closely match the pattern observed among utilization of healthcare services.\nFinally, experiencing ACEs can impact cervical cancer screening indirectly through socioeconomic status as a potential mediator. Specifically, experiencing ACEs has been associated with diminished socioeconomic status in adolescence and adulthood, [17][18][19][20][21] which, in turn, is associated with lower rates of cervical cancer screening. 22,23 In sum, individual ACE items may positively or negatively impact the utilization of Pap tests.\nThe goal of the current study is to examine if ACEs are associated with uptake and continued use of Pap tests among American women. Specifically, this analysis ascertains whether specific ACEs are associated with odds of women ever receiving a Pap test or having recently received a Pap test.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data source", "text": "Data come from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This random digit dial telephone survey is conducted annually and was designed to be representative of the household-dwelling U.S. states and territories. 24 All states and territories administer a core set of questions. Optional modules can be administered by states and territories, to all or some of their respondents.\nIn the 2009 BRFSS, only one state, Tennessee, elected to administer questions on both ACEs and cervical cancer screening. 25 In Tennessee, a total of 1971 people received the modules containing both ACEs and cervical cancer screening. Of these, 1967 were women older than the age of 21, which is the age at which Pap tests are recommended. 26 Respondents missing data (i.e., missing or responses of ''don't know'' or ''refused'') on any study variable were excluded, yielding an analytic sample of 1527.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "The 2009 BRFSS included an 11-item version of the ACE scale, which was used to measure the independent variables for this study. The items measured if several experiences had occurred before age 18. 4,27 These items are listed in Table 1. All items were dichotomized to reflect whether or not the respondent had experienced the item, consistent with previous research. 28 Three items capturing sexual abuse were combined to create a single measure of sexual abuse. This resulted in nine ACE measures.\nThe main outcome of interest was the utilization of Pap smears. The BRFSS asked two questions related to cervical cancer screening: ''A Pap test is a test for cancer of the cervix.\nHave you ever had a Pap test?'' and ''How long has it been since you had your last Pap test?'' These were used to create the following two variables: (1) ever received a Pap test (yes vs. no) and (2) received a Pap test in the past 3 years (yes vs. no), which would imply currently up-to-date with screening. These variables were based on the 2003 US Preventative Task Force's recommendations for cervical cancer screening, which recommend that women between the ages of 21 and 65 receive Pap tests at least every 3 years. 29 The US Preventative Task Force updated their recommendations in 2012 to include cotesting of Pap and HPV testing every 5 years for women 30-54. 26 Because this analysis utilized data from 2009, the former guidelines were considered in analysis.\nSeveral variables were included in analyses as potential confounders. Age was included as a continuous variable. Gender was measured as a dichotomous variable. Race and ethnicity were measured using a dichotomous variable (non-Latino white vs. other). Educational attainment was recoded from its original categories (i.e., kindergarten or less, 1st through 8th grade, 9th through 11th grade, high school graduate, 1-3 years of college, and 4 or more years of college) to continuous values that represented the midpoint of the category in terms of years of education, except for the last category coded as 16 years. This coding system has been previously used with analyses using the ACE module in the BRFSS 13 and was adopted here because conclusions remained largely unchanged when compared to using the original variable categories.

In this way, analyses mirror the age-specific recommendations for cancer screening. Three groups of logistic regression models were fit for each of the two outcomes. For the first group, bivariate associations between each of the nine ACE measures and the outcome were modeled. For the second group, confounders were added to these models.

A majority of respondents had ever received a Pap test (93.55%). A smaller majority had received a Pap test in the last 3 years (85.44%). Emotional abuse was the most commonly experienced ACE measure (27.93%) and living with someone who was jailed (6.92%) was the least commonly experienced. On average, respondents were 49.32 years old. About four-fifths of respondents were non-Latino white (81.88%). Respondents, on average, had some college education (13.8 years of education). Under a third of participants had received a hysterectomy (30.84%).\nTable 3 shows the result of logistic regression models predicting odds of ever receiving a Pap test, among women aged 21 and older. In bivariate models (Model 1), living in a household in which adults treated each other violently was associated with a 104% increase in odds of receiving a Pap test (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13, 3.68). This relationship remained significant after accounting for confounders (Model 2) and after accounting for confounders and other ACEs (Model 3). No other ACEs were associated with odds of ever receiving Pap tests.\nTable 4 shows the result of logistic regression models predicting odds of receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years   Follow-up analyses that individually introduced confounders into the model with physical abuse revealed that the greatest attenuation of this relationship resulted with the introduction of educational attainment into the model. In this sample, higher educational attainment was associated with higher odds of receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years and lower odds of reporting physical abuse. In Model 3, no ACEs were associated with odds of receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years. However, when education was treated as a categorical variable, sexual abuse was still associated with lower odds of receiving a Pap test.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The present study offered important insight into how ACEs are associated with cervical cancer screenings. Findings revealed that specific ACEs are associated with both the uptake and continued use of Pap tests. This is important for a few reasons.\nFirst, it provides support for a growing body of research that has shown an association between specific ACEs and cancer overall 27,28,30,31 and cervical cancer specifically. 32 That is, the negative association of some ACEs on current compliance with cervical cancer recommendations may be a reason why ACEs are associated with increased odds of cancer.\nNext, because only specific ACEs were associated with cervical cancer screening and because associations were both positive and negative and associations depended on outcome, this research highlights the benefits of disaggregating items in the ACE scale. These items, as shown in this study, are not equally prevalent in the population. As a result, some of them may be more normative and potentially less harmful than others. Also, by analyzing specific ACEs, the field can ex-amine more nuanced research questions and arrive at more meaningful conclusions.\nNotably, the findings suggest that different ACEs are important for determining ever use and continued use of Pap tests. Women who were exposed to violence among adults in the household were more likely to have ever received a Pap test. While it is unclear why this factor was protective, it is consistent with the general pattern observed among ACEs and utilization of healthcare services. 16 It is also possible that experiencing vicarious violence may lead to posttraumatic growth or positive change resulting from dealing with the crisis. 33 That is, women may have an increased motivation to take care of their health following exposure to violence and the potential ramifications that this violence has on others. Because this association was not observed for current Pap test compliance (i.e., in past 3 years), it is possible that this association is limited to first time screening and does not extend to repeat screening. However, because posttraumatic growth is observed in response to a wide range of adversities, 33 further research should examine this as a potential explanation for the observed association between household violence and life time cervical cancer screening. Interestingly, physical and sexual abuse were each associated with reduced odds of recent cervical cancer screenings. That is, these experiences discourage regular Pap tests. It is possible that these women avoid screening altogether. However, given the high prevalence of ever screening among women in the sample, it is more likely that abuse is discouraging repeat screening. As previously mentioned, because Pap tests may lead to retraumatization and discomfort for survivors of sexual abuse, 6,7 it is conceivable that these women would elect to avoid these procedures after initial negative experiences with them.\nBecause the association between physical abuse and receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years became nonsignificant with the introduction of educational attainment into the model, educational attainment may mediate the association between physical abuse and cervical cancer screening. In this sample, higher education was associated with lower odds of abuse, but only among women aged 21-65. However, proper mediation cannot be tested in this study because, at present, binary independent variables and full weights cannot be done with Stata. Comparatively, the association with sexual abuse CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING remained significant until other ACEs were accounted for, suggesting that overlap in these adversities is notable.\nThere are limitations to consider when interpreting the results of the present study. Because the data are cross-sectional, several problems are inherent (i.e., directionality of relationships cannot be established and recall bias cannot be accounted for). However, given that cervical cancer screening does not start until adulthood, it is unlikely that screening will have led to adversity. Also, the study sample is limited to Tennessee, which is different from many other states in the country given its low population density (average of 153.9/mile 2 ) and the fact that one-third of residents live in rural settings. 34 Therefore, generalizations must be made cautiously.\nNext, while weights and adjustments created by BRFSS attempt to make the survey representative of the underlying population, nonresponse bias has still been a documented issue with the BRFSS. 35 Consequently, the present analyses may not be fully representative of the noninstitutionalized adult population in Tennessee. Also, because of the way the BRFSS asked questions about cervical cancer screening, we cannot determine if women have undergone alternative cervical cancer screening procedures or when their hysterectomies occurred relative to their last recommended screening date.\nFinally, as noted previously, recommendations for screening intervals changed in 2012. 26 As the data included in this analysis were from 2009, guidelines from 2003 were considered contemporary in this study. The 2012 addition of cotesting (cytology plus HPV DNA testing) for women aged 30-65 may have an impact on screening adherence, as the interval for screening with this method was extended to every 5 years. However, more research is needed to explore this effect.\nLimitations not withstanding, findings highlight opportunities to improve the cervical cancer screening procedures for women who are survivors of sexual and physical abuse. Healthcare providers may be able to mitigate the fears and concerns of patients undergoing Pap tests better if they screen for a history of child abuse. This is especially important given that few women who experience sexual abuse disclose this information to their physicians. 36 This is further complicated by the fact that most women who have experienced sexual abuse as children are not asked about their experiences. 37 This is perhaps due to reluctance on the part of physicians to screen for child abuse because they feel uncomfortable doing so or they do not see a medical need to do so. 38 However, if and when women make a history of childhood sexual abuse known to their healthcare providers, efforts to make the examination more comfortable, such as sharing control of procedures with the patient and adjusting the position of the examination, 6 can be made. In all, findings highlight groups of women that would greatly benefit from care that acknowledges and addresses their past childhood adversities.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Cancer statistics", "journal": "CA Cancer J Clin", "year": "2014", "authors": "R Siegel; J Ma; Z Zou; A Jemal"}, {"title": "Cervical cancer trends in the United States: A 35-year population-based analysis", "journal": "J Womens Health", "year": "2012", "authors": "O Adegoke; S Kulasingam; B Virnig"}, {"title": "Screening and cervical cancer cure: Population based cohort study", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2012", "authors": "B Andrae; Tm-L Andersson; P C Lambert"}, {"title": "Available at: www.cdc.gov/ violenceprevention/acestudy/prevalence", "journal": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results: Of the 35,413 incidents, 6,573 involved hands, fists, or feet, and 1,866 involved external weapons of which 576 were guns. Most incidents were male-on-female: 63.4% (no weapon), 77.4% (bodily weapon), 50.2% (nongun external weapon), and 79.5% (gun). Guns were used most often to threaten the partner (69.1%). When a gun (vs. bodily or nongun external weapon) was used, IPV victims were less likely to have visible injuries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.64 and 0.23, respectively)-offenders were less likely to have pushed or shoved, grabbed, punched, or kicked the victim-but (victims) were more likely to be frightened (AOR = 3.13 and 1.49, respectively). Conclusions: Weapon use of any type by an intimate partner is associated with a wide range of violent offender behavior and multiple negative outcomes for victims. The use of a gun has implications that include, but go beyond, physical injury of the victim. Documentation of the enforcement of state law regarding gun removal merits improvement, which has important implications for the evaluation of policies designed to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "G uns figure prominently in the violent lives and deaths of women. An estimated 4.5 million U.S. women alive today have, at one time, been threatened with a gun held by their intimate partner. 1,2 About 900,000 have been shot or shot at by an intimate partner. 1,2 And when it comes to fatalities, women in the United States are more than twice as likely to be shot and killed by their male intimate as they are to be fatally shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, strangled, or killed in any other way by a stranger. 3,4 Federal law (the 1994 Violence Against Act and the 1996 Lautenberg Amendment) prohibits persons under certain domestic violence restraining orders and persons convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor from purchasing and possessing firearms. Going beyond federal statute, some states engage law enforcement officers to remove guns from batterers. The scope of these laws varies substantially-some require removal, some allow it, some are specific to guns used in the incident, and some are for all guns. 5 The idea of officers removing guns at the scene of intimate partner violence (IPV) has substantial public support. 6 Unfortunately, we lack systematic information about the degree to which IPV gun removal laws are being implemented and enforced.\nWe also know relatively little about the nonfatal use of guns against an intimate partner. A recent systematic review of the literature identified 10 studies that assessed the prevalence of nonfatal gun use by an intimate partner and raised the question of whether it is limited to severe physical abuse or is used more widely as a tool of intimidation. 7 Another recent review, 8 summarizing research that assessed the risk of IPV given access to firearms, found that, most often, having a gun in the home was not associated with an increased risk of nonfatal IPV. [9][10][11] In battering, however, there appears to be a link: firearm ownership has been associated with batterers' likelihood of threatening a partner with a gun, 12 a firearm in the home has been associated with batterers' use of the gun against the partner, 13 and, in a study of 199 abused pregnant women, firearm access was associated with more severe abuse. 14 In a study in Canada, firearm access was associated with severity of assault but not because of firearm use; 15 a note of caution is necessary when interpreting the study findings given that only three used a firearm in the assault. The present investigation extends this prior research and expands the scope of inquiry to include policy and practice.\nUsing 1 year of department-mandated domestic violence forms collected by police officers at the scene of domestic violence in one of the largest U.S. cities provided an efficient way to generate population-based knowledge about guns and nonfatal IPV. We examined the frequency and nature of gun use (e.g., who used it and how), the outcome (e.g., whether injury is more or less likely if a gun is displayed; one could reasonably expect either outcome), policy relevance (i.e., whether restraining orders are associated with lower rates of gun use), and actual law enforcement practices (e.g., how often officers take custody of a gun at the scene) in incidents of IPV.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "A retrospective cohort study design was employed using all, not a sample of, IPV cases to which police were called in Philadelphia during 2013.

Completion of the form, in its entirety, is mandated whether or not an arrest is made.\nLaw enforcement uses a broad definition of domestic violence that includes all violence in families as well as incidents involving housemates. The Philadelphia Police Department received 137,867 domestic calls for assistance in 2013; a substantial number were screened out because they were deemed to be unfounded (n = 35,668), another type of crime (n = 18,878), or another type of investigation (typically investigation of a premises; n = 26,195), which yielded 57,126 calls.

The digitizing firm reported an accuracy rate of 99%. Open-ended fields (e.g., the officer's description of the incident) were coded by a team of research assistants. To ensure the quality of the coding, coders were trained on a subset of the data until their work was deemed to be of sufficient quality before they were allowed to work on the data set itself. Second, a 10% sample of each batch of 1,000 cases was double coded, feedback given to each coder, and differences were reconciled so as to maintain a high level of inter-rater reliability. And, finally, coders coded one field at a time (quality is believed to be higher if coders focus on one field at a time) so multiple passes were made through the 35,413 records. The type and status of the offender-victim relationship, injuries, and gun involvement were coded using the relationship, body map, and narrative fields of the forms.\nWeapon use consisted of four categories: no weapon, bodily weapon only (hands, fists, or feet), nongun external weapon (either alone or with a bodily weapon), and gun (either alone or in conjunction with a bodily weapon, nongun external weapon, or both). Incidents were considered to have involved a gun if a gun was mentioned in the description recorded by an officer. Whether a gun was fired was noted but the definition of gun involvement (also referred to as ''gun use'') was not limited to shots being fired.\nGun use was classified into 1 of 11 categories: shooting the victim; shooting at but not hitting the victim; pistol whipping; threat with hostile display (e.g., ''Compl. [complainant] stated her exboyfriend came over her house to see their kids and while he was there he showed the Compl. a gun and stated 'This is for you and your new boyfriend.' Then he pulled the gun out of his waist. Male left w/o incident.''), threat without hostile display (e.g., ''The Compl. states she's been separated from her husband for 1 year and he stated to her that if she dates someone else he will shoot her with his gun.''), threat via telephone, text, or social media (e.g., ''Compl. states offender [child's father] called her over the phone and stated 'I am going to come over your house with a gun and kill you'.''); gun was stolen or taken in context of IPV incident; gun was recovered or transported (e.g., while being questioned, the victim gave the police the offender's illegal gun); the offender was carrying during the incident or the gun was simply present during the incident (e.g., ''Compl. states that she awoke in bed this morning with her exboyfriend (offender) on top of her choking her. He then punched her twice on the left side of her face, scratched her neck & stated 'I'm gonna kill you bitch.' Compl. observed a blk handgun laying on the bed beside him. She screamed & her sons came in the bedroom & pushed the offender off her. He then fled residence via front door.''); the victim was fearful because the offender was known to have or carry a gun (e.g., ''Compl. states verbal dispute over custody issues with daughter. States offender threatening and does carry a gun. The officer spoke to offenders parole officer who is issuing a warrant for his arrest for absconder. Does have number of firearms violations per p/o [parole officer].''); and no gun involvement.\nThe form referred to the parties as ''offenders'' and ''complainants'' rather than offenders and victims or suspects and complainants.

Multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression was used to identify demographic characteristics associated with weapon (gun and other weapon) use. The analytic technique allows for two comparisons central to the topic at hand: we compared those who used a gun versus no weapon and those who used a gun versus another weapon. The multivariate logistic regressions that followed took into account multiple demographic and situational characteristics associated with gun use. The key predictor variable of interest was whether a gun was involved.\nAs is common in administrative data, information was missing for a substantial minority of the incidents. When data were missing for a predictor variable, a ''not ascertained'' category was included in the regressions. To assess the potential effect of missing data in the outcome variable, post hoc analyses were conducted, in which cases missing outcome variable data were dropped and the regressions run again.

For example, offenders who used a nongun weapon or a bodily weapon only were one-and-a-half to two times as likely to have punched the victim than when a gun was used (34.0% and 46.1%, respectively, vs. 21.0%). When demographic and incident characteristics were taken into account (see lower half of Table 2), the general pattern of findings became more pronounced. For example, continuing with ''punched,'' we see that offenders who used their hands, fists, or feet were nearly three-and-a-half times as likely and those who used a nongun external weapon were more than twice as likely to have punched their victims as did offenders who used a gun.\nTable 3, which reports findings for all four weapon use categories, documents that all of the listed offender behaviors-threatened, stalked, imprisoned, injured children, broke in, threw objects, damaged property, and violated a protection from abuse order-differed statistically among the four groups.

Officers recorded Uniform Crime Reporting incident codes that are a felony or are likely a felony (e.g., certain robberies) for 309 of the incidents involving a gun. If the offenders were found guilty, they would be prohibited by federal law from purchasing and possessing a firearm.\nPennsylvania law, passed in October 2005, mandates the removal of weapons under certain circumstances. The law requires the arresting officer to ''seize all weapons used by the defendant in the commission of the alleged offense'' if a probable-cause arrest (i.e., without a warrant) can be made under certain statutes (e.g., simple assault) and the officer has observed ''recent physical injury to the victim or other corroborative evidence'' [18 Pa.

Of particular note is the finding that although victims against whom a gun was used were less likely to have visible injuries, they were far more likely to have been threatened and substantially more likely to be frightened. As a whole, findings suggest that (1) persons who use a gun against their intimate partners are less intent on inflicting physical harm than are those who use another type of weapon; (2) intimates use a gun to intimidate and coerce (i.e., to increase victim compliance during an assault), which results in fewer visible injuries and greater victim fear; or (3) some combination of the two. Even when other offender behaviors (punching, kicking, etc.) are taken into account, offenders who use a gun against an intimate partner are more likely to be gone when officers arrive and, if still present, are more likely to be threatening on the scene. Many of those who left the scene may well have taken the gun with them. If an offender had left the scene, an arrest was understandably less likely. The mandated removal of weapons when the offender was arrested, however, was reported to have occurred in fewer than half of the incidents that involved a gun. The lack of documented enforcement is notable and merits research beyond one locale. In many jurisdictions, a substantial number of arrested domestic violence offenders are released shortly after arrest, and access to a gun at that time could increase risk for victims.

The data, from the fifth-largest U.S. city, included a large number of incidents that allowed for the use of statistical techniques that take into account multiple victim, perpetrator, and incident characteristics along with the primary variable of interest, weapon use.\nThe administrative data provided an efficient and economical means to study the topic. A general population survey of a sample of residents would be needed to be able to estimate all gun use against an intimate partner. Conducting such a survey, either as a stand-alone survey or as an addition to an on-going survey, is possible yet challenging because of currently low response rates, a variety of concerns related to self-report, and the cost-benefit ratio of spending research dollars on a survey when a viable alternative exists to address a similar question. In addition, the data allowed us to describe officers' self-report of their action in terms of following the legal mandate to remove firearms when an arrest is made, an otherwise difficult phenomenon to observe.\nThe accuracy of the information the officers reported could not be verified. Thus, for example, we cannot ascertain whether, when an offender was arrested, a gun was present and officers did not remove it or whether officers removed a gun but did not record it. Nor can we ascertain the completeness of or potential systematic bias in the information recorded. For example, an offender may have shaken his fist at but not hit the victim and the victim not reported the action to an officer or the officer not recorded it on the form, whereas victims may have been more likely to report and the officer to record that a gun was pointed at them. The fact that offenders were more likely to be threatening on the scene as well as toward the victim suggests, however, that disproportionate victim reporting (i.e., over-reporting) of threats with a gun might not have occurred. The quantity and quality of available information can be expected to improve with further law enforcement investigation, as would be the situation for the subset of cases (not identified in the on-the-scene reports) that were assigned to detectives. Logistic regressions to obtain the AORs took into account relationship variables (married, breaking up, and former relationship), offender characteristics (gender, race and ethnicity, age, on probation, and history of substance abuse), victim characteristics (gender, race and ethnicity, and age), whether witnesses were present (any, children), history of domestic violence (prior history, prior DV reports to police, and ever had a domestic violence restraining order), and, to take missing data into account, a ''not ascertained'' category for each covariate.\na p < 0.0014, the p level after correcting for multiple tests. Another limitation is that the forms did not contain information about victim behavior during the incident. Given that victims were more likely to be punched, kicked, injured, etc. when a nongun weapon (vs. gun) was used, one could reasonably surmise that victims might have been more likely to try to defend themselves or fight back when a nongun weapon was used but to acquiesce when a gun was used. Or perhaps offenders using a nongun weapon were simply more intent on assaulting the victim than were offenders using a gun. Although study findings suggest these possibilities, such questions cannot be tested in the data.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "GUNS IN IPV: COMPARING INCIDENTS BY WEAPON TYPE", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Implications", "text": "Clinical care. Healthcare providers respond primarily to the health problem with which they are presented and, in the case of active battering, the acute issue likely is an injury inflicted by the abusers' hands, fists, or feet. Our findings indicate that when a weapon other than a gun is used, the risk of physical harm is higher, perhaps, in part, because the potential victim chooses to resist or fight back, resulting in further harm.\nThe presence of a gun might be associated with lesser injury than another weapon, but it portends ill for the woman. Guns can facilitate a condition known as coercive control, in which an abuser dominates and intimidates his intimate partner. 17 Women living under chronic threat can be expected to have a high allostatic load that has been associated with multiple negative health outcomes. Inquiring about gun involvement in incidents of IPV will provide the clinician with a greater understanding of the circumstances that the woman routinely navigates.\nPhysicians practicing in Florida likely are aware of a 2011 state law restricting physician inquiries about guns in the home. It includes an exception for circumstances in which the physician ''in good faith believes this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety or to the safety of others.'' 18 Abuse is likely one of those circumstances.\nThere has been relatively little discussion, let alone agreement, about what physicians should do next. Options range from nothing (record the information in the chart only) to informing the woman about laws and procedures by which her abuser can be prevented from purchasing and possessing a gun to encouraging her to get her own gun. (In terms of the latter, note that the best available research shows that women's purchase of a handgun is associated with a subsequent and lasting increase in their risk of becoming a victim of both homicide and suicide. 19 )\nEducating physicians about relevant laws can be helpful; for example, a recent article 20 debunks the idea that physicians in some states are barred from asking about guns in the home and suggests when such questions might be most appropriate. Another recent article suggests that most patients would be receptive: a majority of individuals, including gun owners, believe that it is at least sometimes appropriate for physicians to ask about guns in the home. 21 Although the process can be anticipated to be somewhat lengthy, physician organizations are encouraged to begin discussions so as to arrive at a standard of practice.\nPartners in prevention. Police are the most common first responders in IPV. Victims typically call the police, and call repeatedly, in an attempt to get their partner to stop being violent. Calls for police assistance (''911'' calls) typically are made long before there is a domestic violence restraining order or a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction. Thus, law enforcement work can be a useful point of intervention and prevention.\nCertain potentially helpful officer actions occur, at least according to the report of the officers themselves, less often than would be ideal: officers reported that they provided about one-fourth of the victims with a community resource card (an action mandated by Department directive), one-sixth with the phone number for victim-assistance services, and one-tenth with information about the domestic violence advocate. Officers reported telling about half of the victims about protection from abuse orders, the option that would require the most effort for victims (e.g., filing a petition and appearing before a judge) but would, if certain orders are issued, prohibit the abuser from being able to legally purchase and possess a gun. And, finally, officer documentation of the enforcement of state law regarding the removal of guns at the scene can be improved.\nPolicy. Understanding the scope of gun possession by abusers might encourage some legislatures to extend firearm purchase and possession prohibitions to emergency restraining orders. Although a woman's risk of homicide is highest when she is trying to end the relationship, 22 most state laws regarding restraining orders are consistent with federal law, which limits the prohibitions to only certain domestic violence restraining orders and emergency orders are not among them.\nIt is important to know how laws related to guns and IPV are implemented and enforced. Such knowledge can be used in future agency directives and legislative action. The few evaluations of the aforementioned laws designed to reduce abusers' access to guns document modest effects. [23][24][25][26] Each of the investigations was limited by an inability to assess the degree to which the laws were implemented.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Victims of IPV against whom a gun was used were less likely to have visible injuries, were far more likely to have been threatened, and were substantially more likely to be frightened. Medicine and public health focus primarily on physical injuries (both fatal and nonfatal) to document the nature and scope of gun violence. Such a focus may need to be reconsidered if gun use in IPV is primarily a means to an end. In this situation, guns would heighten fear and compliance and likely would reduce willingness to leave or otherwise end the relationship, thus promoting chronic abuse.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author is grateful to the Philadelphia Police Department for providing access to the data.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines IPV as ''physical violence, sexual violence, threats of physical/sexual violence, and psychological/emotional abuse perpetrated by a current or former spouse, common-law spouse, nonmarital dating partners, or boyfriends/girlfriends of the same or opposite sex.'' 4,5 Previous studies have linked IPV to a wide range of adverse health consequences, including injury, 3,[6][7][8] chronic pain, 9,10 gastrointestinal disorders, [11][12][13] sexually transmitted diseases, [14][15][16][17] disability, 18,19 poor pregnancy outcomes, 20 substance abuse, [21][22][23] depression, 24,25 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 26,27 and death. 28 Clearly, a gender gap exists in susceptibility to violence in general and IPV in particular, with most national surveys suggesting higher IPV rates in women versus men. 3,29,30 Based on the National Violence against Women Survey conducted through telephone interviews of 8000 women and 8000 men, nearly 25% of women and 7.6% of men disclosed rape and/or physical assault by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or date at least once during their lifetime. 29 In addition, 1.5% of women (representing 1.5 million women) and 0.9% of men (representing 834,732 men) said that they were raped and/or physically assaulted by a partner in the previous 12 months. 29 Finally, nearly 5% of women and 0.6% of men reported being stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime. In addition, 0.5% of women (representing 503,485 women) and 0.2% of men (representing 185,496 men) were stalked by an intimate partner in the past year. 29 Although both sexes are involved in IPV and experience IPV-related health outcomes, 31,32 researchers have traditionally focused on physical and nonphysical forms of violence perpetrated by a male partner against a female victim. 1,33 In the general population, lifetime prevalence of IPV against women has been estimated at 22%, 3,[34][35][36] with physical violence affecting 17%-34% and nonphysical violence affecting 12%-35% of women. [37][38][39] Among women identified in primary care or emergency departments (EDs), 37%-50% reported lifetime physical violence and 36%-72% lifetime nonphysical violence, with 10%-18% reporting physical violence and 28%-44% reporting nonphysical violence in the past year. [40][41][42][43][44] Women with a history of IPV were shown to utilize healthcare services (including primary care and EDs) for injuries and physical and mental health problems nearly twice as often as women with no history of IPV, 37,45,46 highlighting opportunities for IPV screening by healthcare providers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates annual IPV-related costs among women at $5.8 billion (with $4.0 billion in healthcare costs). 45,47 Based on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Violence Against Women Survey, it is estimated that $2.4 billion in medical costs are attributable to physical assault and $1.6 million in medical costs are attributable to rape against women by an intimate partner. 37,48 Routine screening for identification and treatment of IPV by healthcare providers can potentially reduce the burden of IPV and its associated health problems on individuals, families, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. 40 According to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), high-quality evidence supporting IPV screening in primary care and EDs as a safe and effective strategy for the prevention of IPV and its associated health outcomes remains inconclusive 40,49 with recently conducted intervention trials yielding inconsistent findings.  While the USPSTF and other organizations have recommended screening of reproductive aged women for IPV in various healthcare settings, 31 the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO) requires all EDs to have policies and procedures in place for IPV screening and patients who disclose IPV can be treated or referred to services, which address healthcare needs associated with IPV. 45 Despite the JCAHO mandate, less than half of US EDs report having policies and procedures in place for IPV screening, and even fewer EDs regularly ask about mental health problems in women identified as IPV victims. 40,45,78 A bidirectional association 31 has been previously suggested between IPV history and costly mental health problems 45 such as symptoms of depression, 79-81 PTSD, 82,83 suicidality, [84][85][86] and substance abuse. [87][88][89] In a recent study of women enrolled in the Group Health Cooperative, IPV exposure was specifically linked to excessive utilization of mental health services. 11,37 Comorbid mental health problems can adversely impact the success of IPV interventions and often present at EDs rather than specialized centers while being underdiagnosed by ED healthcare providers. 45 Successful screening interventions require a better understanding of what mental health symptoms and diagnoses are frequently encountered in patients with a history of IPV, for the purpose of referral to on-site and off-site services. Although a growing body of the literature has evaluated mental health outcomes of IPV in both sexes, 38,[90][91][92][93][94][95] previous studies were predominantly focused on women and little is known about sex-specific mental health outcomes of IPV. Limited evidence suggests that men and women respond differently to IPV exposure and that IPV-related mental healthcare needs may be sex specific. 1,96 To our knowledge, no published studies have examined overall and sex-specific utilization of healthcare services linking physical IPV (PIPV) to mental health diagnoses, using a nationally representative sample of ED discharges.\nThe purpose of this population-based cross-sectional study is to examine these relationships among male and female adult patients, 18-64 years of age, whose medical records were included in the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's (HCUP) Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS).

Furthermore, ICD-9-CM clinical classification category codes (DXCCS1-DXCCS15) were used to identify ED discharges whereby the patient had been diagnosed with the following mental health problems: ( 1 [60][61][62][63][64], and household socioeconomic status in quartiles as denoted by the patient's zip code. In addition, the principal diagnosis was ranked among PIPV cases, and the most common 19 diagnoses with a 20th category labelled as ''Others'' were presented and compared between men and women in terms of relative proportion. Based on Figure 1, the most common principal diagnoses among men (aside from the ''Others'' category) were ''adult physical abuse'' (12.0%), followed by ''contusion of face/scalp/neck'' (8.1%), and ''open wound of the scalp'' (5.2%), with similar proportions obtained for ''head injury'' (4.7%) and ''open wound of forehead'' (4.8%).

Summary statistics included prevalence proportions of PIPV and mental disorders, accounting for sampling design complexity, as well as weighted totals. Prevalence of PIPV was estimated overall and within strata of hospital-and patient-level categorical variables. Among IPV cases, men and women were compared in terms of principal diagnosis proportionate distribution. Comparisons between categorical variables were done using design-based F-tests. Moreover, we examined differences in the prevalence of specific and overall mental health diagnoses by PIPV status. Those analyses were conducted on the entire sample of eligible discharges (18-64 years, Weighted N = 81,386,155). Using PIPV cases and the 10% sample of controls from the non-IPV subgroup, multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine PIPV as a predictor of mental health diagnoses, adjusting for potential confounders. Finally, using the same 10% subsample of controls and the full sample of PIPV cases, we performed sex-specific analyses to evaluate whether observed associations differed according to sex, while examining interaction effects. A second 10% sample of non-PIPV controls (Control B) was also selected and the results were contrasted with those of the first 10% subsample (Control A). All analyses were performed taking into account the singlestage cluster sampling design, through STATA's svy commands.

Furthermore, variations in PIPV prevalence were observed according to US hospital region, patient sex, and age ( p < 0.0001), but not according to hospital urban-rural location, trauma center designation, teaching status, ownership, or household socioeconomic status. The estimated PIPV prevalence was higher among female (57 per 100,000) versus male (6 per 100,000) patients; also, PIPV prevalence was highest among patients 25-34 years of age and in the Western region of the United States (Table 1).\nOverall, PIPV was positively and significantly associated with the presence of any mental health diagnosis, either before (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.32) or after (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23-1.48) adjustment for confounders. However, the magnitude and direction of the association differed according to the specific mental health disorder. In multivariable models, the strongest positive associations pertained to alcohol-related (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 2.62-3.50) and adjustment (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.56-3.58) disorders, followed by intentional self-harm, suicide, and intentional self-inflicted injury (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.89), anxiety disorders (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.40), drug-related disorders (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47), and mood disorders (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.31). By contrast, PIPV was not significantly associated with disorders usually diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence, attention-deficit, conduct, and disruptive behavior disorders or personality disorders. Interestingly, a significant but negative association was noted between PIPV and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35-0.71) (Table 2).\nFinally, we examined interactions between PIPV and sex in relation to the selected mental health disorders (Table 3). With the exception of alcohol-and drug-related disorders, there were no significant interactions whereby the magnitude or direction of associations between PIPV and mental health disorders differed between men and women. For alcohol-related disorders, the association with PIPV was stronger among women (adjusted OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 2.79-3.72) compared to men (adjusted OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.42-2.77). Similarly, drug-related disorders were significantly  ", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first populationbased cross-sectional study to examine sex-specific associations between PIPV and mental health diagnoses, using a nationally representative sample of ED discharges. Our results suggested that PIPV was positively associated with specific diagnoses, namely, alcohol-related, adjustment, intentional self-harm, suicide, intentional self-inflicted injury, anxiety, and drug-related and mood disorders, and negatively associated with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In addition, alcohol-related and drug-related disorders were more strongly associated with PIPV among women than among men.\nOur results should be interpreted with caution and in light of several limitations that arise from the use of deidentified databases. First, little data could be gleaned from HCUP NEDS regarding clinical presentation and since our study included only ED patients, physicians may not have been aware of relevant patient experiences, due to the urgency of events. This may explain the paucity of secondary diagnostic codes available for each patient. Furthermore, race was not included as a data element in the HCUP NEDS, precluding the evaluation of racial disparities in PIPV. Second, the HCUP NEDS database consists of discharge records whereby multiple observations may be attributed to an individual patient. Given the nature of PIPV, the likelihood of repeat ED visits for each individual patient may be substantial, but cannot be ascertained in HCUP NEDS. Third, the crosssectional design precludes examination of temporal or causal relationships between PIPV and various mental health problems. Fourth, the quality and completeness of HCUP NEDS data depend on existing medical records, which may result in misclassification and residual confounding biases. Of note, PIPV is typically underreported by patients and under identified by healthcare providers, suggesting a high false negative rate and underestimation of PIPV prevalence. 97 More importantly, patients experiencing IPV were identified based on ICD-9-CM codes, which do not take into account psychological forms of violence that often co-occur with physical and sexual forms of violence based on the CDC definition, especially among patients diagnosed with mental health disorders. Accordingly, IPV prevalence estimates are substantially lower in the NEDS population compared to estimates from general and clinical population surveys. For instance, previously conducted surveys in ED settings have estimated 2%-7% annual prevalence rates of IPV. 98 Similar validity issues are encountered with respect to PIPV and mental health disorders based on ICD-9-CM, whereby date of diagnosis is unknown in NEDS. In addition, the hypothesized relationship between PIPV and mental health disorders may be confounded by patient and hospital characteristics that were not assessed in the HCUP NEDS. Nevertheless, administrative databases are ideal for providing a large patient sample with sufficient power to detect uncommon occurrences, including mental health diagnoses.\nPIPV is a significant public health concern that has been linked to increased risk of a variety of mental health problems, including depression, 24,81,99,100 alcohol abuse, 101,102 substance use, 102 suicidality, 103 and PTSD. 104 Although the majority of PIPV research has focused primarily on women, 105 it was found that men also experience mental health problems associated with PIPV. 103,106 It is estimated that more than half of PIPV events are not reported to the police, 107 suggesting the need for intervention efforts aimed outside the realm of law enforcement. Healthcare providers, particularly those working within ED settings, can serve as an important point of contact for victims of PIPV. Although PIPV is common among patients presenting to EDs, 108,109 screening and identification for PIPV by healthcare providers are low. 109 Considering that intervention for mental health problems related to PIPV may reduce the risk of revictimization, 110 it is important for healthcare providers to appropriately address these issues in addition to screening for PIPV among both men and women seeking healthcare in EDs. Furthermore, despite consistent findings suggesting an association between PIPV and mental health problems, few studies 81 have examined the relationship between PIPV and diagnosed mental disorders. Specific mental health diagnoses may be important clues in identifying individuals at an increased risk of PIPV victimization or perpetration.\nPrevious research suggested sex differences in mental health problems related to PIPV, consistent with our study findings. Among victims of PIPV presenting to EDs, women tend to report more symptoms related to depression, 96 PTSD, substance abuse, and alcohol use 102 and men report symptoms related to depression, 96,103 PTSD, and suicidality. 103 Two study findings necessitate further elucidation. First, the inverse relationship between PIPV and psychoses may be explained by PIPV underreporting or absence of a partner in ED patients diagnosed with these mental health disorders. Second, in line with the concept that PIPV is a public health issue that cuts across all layers of society, PIPV prevalence did not differ significantly according to household socioeconomic status although it was linked to other hospital and patient characteristics.", "n_publication_ref": 25, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, PIPV in ED settings may be linked to a wide range of mental health disorders, with women experiencing comorbid PIPV and substance use disorders more frequently than men. Increased awareness of the connection between PIPV and mental health conditions may lead to better referrals or coordination of care. These sex-specific associations should be used to guide PIPV interventions in ED settings.

This study describes IM program directors' perceptions of women's health topics that residents should master and the current state of women's health education in IM residency programs. Materials and Methods: We recruited 408 program directors of IM residency programs to complete an electronic cross-sectional survey. Participants were surveyed about expected resident mastery of twelve women's health topics in the context of their program's current characteristics, core curricula, and training opportunities. Results: One hundred twelve IM program directors completed the survey (response rate 27%). The percentage of program directors who perceived that residents should master each of the twelve women's health topics ranged from 48% to 98%, with the most program directors expecting mastery of osteoporosis (N = 110, 98%), sexually transmitted infection (N = 110, 98%), and gender-specific cancer (N = 109, 97%). These topics, however, were not currently included in the core curricula of 6%-12% of programs. Programs offered varied opportunities in women's health, including dedicated women's health electives (N = 76, 68%), concentrations or tracks (N = 8, 7%), and continuity clinics (N = 15, 13%). Most program directors were interested (N = 90, 80%) in expanding women's health opportunities in their programs. Conclusion: While women's health topics were perceived by program directors as a priority for IM resident mastery, certain priority topics and training opportunities were limited. Additional studies are needed to explore barriers to expansion of resident education in women's health and potential solutions.", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "Introduction W omen's health encompasses ''conditions which are unique to women, are more common in women, are more serious in women, and have manifestations, risk factors, or interventions which are different in women.'' 1 Women's health has historically been underrepresented in medical education and in the medical literature. 2 Over the past few decades, multiple professional societies, including the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), 2,3 the American College of Physicians (ACP), 4 the Federated Council for Internal Medicine (FCIM), 5 the National Academy on Women's Health Medical Education (NAWHME), 1 and the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), 6 have emphasized incorporating women's health topics into Internal Medicine (IM) resident level curricula (Table 1). In addition, the Accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) states that IM residents should demonstrate ''sensitivity and responsiveness'' to ''diversity in gender'' as well as the ability to manage ''diagnosis and treatment of gender-specific disease.'' 7 Despite these national recommendations, implementation of women's health education has varied in IM residency programs nationally. Previous cross-sectional surveys of primary care program directors demonstrated some limited growth of women's health opportunities, with 52% of programs offering an ambulatory gynecology rotation in 1994 and 95% of programs offering this rotation in 2004. 8,9 Resident utilization of these opportunities, however, remained constant with 68% participating in 1994 and 67% participating in 2004. 8,9 Surveys at both time points noted discrepancies between perceived and expected resident mastery of topics in women's health. 8,9 A decade later, there exists little data to measure progress in the adoption of recommended women's health curricula.\nAs graduate medical education evolves, it is important to assess if women's health education remains a priority. The past decade has brought increased emphasis on the primary care medical home, work hour restrictions, and competency-based education. The IM milestones, introduced by the ABIM and the ACGME in 2007, emphasize competency-based rather than topic-based assessment of residents, providing an opportunity to incorporate multidisciplinary teaching in women's health within a competency-based framework. 10 Increased work hour restrictions, introduced by the ACGME in 2003 and revised in 2011, have had a mixed impact on the balance of resident patient care and educational activities. [11][12][13] The extent to which this changing educational climate has influenced women's health education is currently unknown. In addition, no prior surveys have compared women's health education in IM programs with and without primary care tracks.\nThis national study describes IM program directors' perceptions of women's health topics that residents should master and the current state of women's health education in IM residency programs with and without primary care tracks.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "We recruited program directors of IM residency programs accredited by the ACGME to complete an electronic cross-sectional survey in 2015.

Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree). These twelve women's health topics were chosen based upon the topics most commonly recommended by national societies as outlined in Table 1: (1) screening for gender-specific cancer, (2) screening for osteoporosis, (3) treating sexually transmitted infections, (4) managing menopausal symptoms, (5) treating cardiovascular disease in women, (6) prescribing contraceptives, (7) treating incontinence, (8) screening for domestic violence, (9) diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome, (10) initiating a workup for abnormal uterine bleeding, (11) providing preconception counseling, and (12) initiating a workup for infertility.\nParticipants also rated their interest in expanding women's health training opportunities (not interested, somewhat interested, very interested). They detailed their expansion plans through an optional open-ended question.\nCurrent state of residency programs. Survey questions about program characteristics included training facility setting, program size, safety net status, the presence of funding dedicated to women's health education, and the presence of a designated primary care track.\nWe asked about women's health opportunities, including research, tracks or concentrations, ambulatory electives, and continuity clinics. We created a composite score by adding the number of women's health opportunities (research, tracks or concentrations, ambulatory electives, and continuity clinics) for each program.

An expert was defined as a faculty member who devotes the majority of his or her clinical practice to women and/or is interested in promoting healthcare for women through public policy, medical education, or research. Additional survey questions included the percent of residents who see at least 50% women in outpatient practice and resident participation in a women's health ambulatory elective.

More than half of programs (N = 67, 60%) had a women's health expert on the IM faculty. The majority of programs reported using a women's health expert from another department (N = 74, 66%), most frequently from obstetrics/gynecology (N = 74, 66%), endocrinology (N = 22, 20%), and cardiology (N = 12, 11%). Of the programs with a women's health rotation, about one third (N = 32, 29%) required resident participation. Overall, resident participation in women's health electives was low: only 21 (19%) reported that greater than 20% of Table 3 shows that programs with a primary care track had significantly more women's health tracks or concentrations, continuity clinics, experts, and research opportunities compared to categorical programs. Programs with a primary care track also had significantly more total women's health opportunities (research, tracks or concentrations, continuity clinics, and electives), with 28 (72%) programs with a primary care track and 21 (29%) categorical programs offering at least two opportunities ( p < 0.0001, Table 3).\nCurrent curricula. The most highly represented women's health topics in core curricula were gender-specific cancer screening (N = 105, 94%), osteoporosis (N = 102, 91%), and sexually transmitted infection (N = 99, 88%) (Fig. 1). There were no significant differences in topics included in the core curricula for programs with and without primary care tracks. The majority of programs (N = 74, 66%) covered 8 or more of the 12 surveyed women's health topics, with a median (interquartile range) of 9 (3) topics covered. Additional women's health topics reported in current core curricula included pregnancy (N = 3), mental health (N = 2), and work/ life balance (N = 2).\nOverall, the percentage of program directors that expected residents to master each women's health topic was higher than the percentage of programs that included that topic in their core curricula (Fig. 1). However, this discordance between expected resident mastery and inclusion in core curricula was statistically significant for infertility only ( p = 0.04, Fig. 1).\nEducational modalities. Women's health curricula were mainly delivered through the ambulatory setting (N = 75, 67%), as opposed to both ambulatory and inpatient (N = 35, 31%) or solely inpatient (N = 1, 0.9%) settings. The most ). Almost all programs used multiple teaching modalities, with 38 (37%) using at least two modalities, 56 (50%) using three or four modalities, and 18 (16%) using five or more modalities. Program directors reported that women's health education was ideally delivered through patient care and direct clinical training (N = 16), small group discussions or clinic conferences (N = 10), hands-on skills training (N = 8), didactics (N = 6), experiential learning with a qualified teacher or mentor (N = 5), and electives (N = 5).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "While surveyed program directors perceived that women's health was a priority for IM resident mastery, overall program inclusion of certain topics and training opportunities was limited. This study is the first to show differences in women's health curricula and opportunities between IM programs with and without a primary care track. These findings suggest variability in IM women's health education nationally, and further research is needed to determine both implementation barriers and the optimal delivery of women's health education to achieve resident mastery.\nProgram directors perceived that women's health topics remain a priority for IM resident mastery. In our survey, over 90% of program directors agreed that IM residents should master at least 7 topics and over 80% agreed that residents should master at least 10 topics. These findings are consistent with prior surveys, where >88% (1994) and 80% (2004) of primary care program directors believed that their residents should master each of 7 (1994) or 12 (2004) topics. 8,9 Although results were similar, our survey asked program directors about mastery for all IM residents, while prior surveys asked about mastery for primary care residents only. Women's health topics identified for resident mastery by program directors were consistent with recommendations from national societies and women's health experts. A recent national survey by Farkas et al. of women's health experts used the Delphi method to generate a consensus list of 35 core women's health knowledge domains for IM residents, and our twelve topics are all on that list. 17 Despite agreement that IM residents should master topics in women's health, inclusion of priority topics in core curricula was inconsistent nationally. For example, the top three women's health topics for resident mastery chosen by program directors in our survey and women's health experts as surveyed by Farkas et al. were osteoporosis, sexually transmitted infection, and gender-specific or cervical cancer screening. 17 Despite program directors' recognition of the importance of these three topics, they were not included in the core curricula of 6%-12% of responding programs. In addition, more national societies list menopause as a priority topic than osteoporosis, but this topic was not included in the core curricula of 22% of responding programs. This may reflect lower priority of menopause by program directors and women's health experts relative to national societies. Fewer than 40% of programs included abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, or preconception counseling in their core curricula, each of which has been prioritized by at least four national societies for IM resident curricula.\nAvailability and utilization of women's health training opportunities varied by program, and nearly one quarter of programs offered no dedicated opportunities. Most programs offered a women's health elective and had faculty with women's health expertise, but a minority had a concentration, track, or continuity clinic. The paucity of dedicated funding for women's health education reported in this survey may have contributed to this limitation in opportunities. Programs with a primary care track employed a greater number of women's health faculty experts and offered more women's health opportunities, especially in the areas of research, continuity clinics, and electives. This may reflect that programs with a primary care track were more commonly from university or academic hospital settings with larger numbers of residents.\nPrograms with a primary care track also had greater inclusion of women's health topics and opportunities compared to prior national surveys reflecting primary care programs. Reported topic inclusion was higher overall compared to data from 1994, when over 80% of responding primary care program directors offered teaching experiences in menopause and cancer screening, but fewer offered topics like coronary artery disease in women (60%) or domestic violence (40%). 9 In our survey, 87% of IM programs with a primary care track had a women's health expert on faculty, compared to 76% of programs in 2004 and 45% of programs in 1994. 8,9 In addition, we found that 80% of programs with a primary care track offered women's health electives, with 51% of programs reporting participation of 20% of residents or fewer. In prior surveys, 52% (1994) and 68% (2004) of primary care program directors managed programs with an elective ambulatory gynecology rotation and reported that 68% (1994) and 67% (2004) of primary care residents participated. 8,9 This decrease in reported participation may reflect that we asked program directors about all IM residents rather than primary care residents alone, as assessed in prior surveys. While these comparisons may represent overall trends over the past 20 years, direct comparisons are limited due to differing survey questions and populations.\nSurvey responses suggested that barriers to expansion of women's health education may include a lack of qualified faculty, interested residents, and effective women's health clinical experiences. While many responding programs used women's health experts from other departments, IM programs may benefit from increased formalized interdisciplinary education drawing from psychiatry, family medicine, obstetrics, and gynecology programs with expertise and clinical opportunities in the physical and mental health of women. Interdisciplinary women's health programs, such as those at Yale University and the University of Pittsburgh, may provide a framework to address these barriers, but long-term sustainability requires collaborative relationships and institutional support. 18,19 In addition, family medicine residency curricula and evaluations may provide a model of how to best incorporate women's health into IM resident education.\nMore research is needed to explore optimal delivery and extent of women's health education to achieve resident clinical competence in women's health. Residents' low comfort with women's health topics has been linked to a lack of clinical and scholarly activities in this area. 20 A number of challenges exist in implementing women's health education in residency programs. In the setting of resident work hour restrictions, IM residents may have less patient exposure, didactics, or elective time. In addition, changing recommendations for screening breast and pelvic examinations may lead to reduced clinical exposure for both medical students and residents, further highlighting the importance of expansion of women's health opportunities. 21,22 Our survey suggests that lectures are the most common method for delivering women's health education, but program directors reported direct clinical training as the ideal modality and a target for curricular expansion. While topic inclusion in core curricula and simulated patient encounters expose residents to women's health, these education modalities may not be sufficient to lead to clinical mastery.\nA strength of this study was that we surveyed both categorical and primary care IM program directors. One limitation of this study was a low response rate, which may yield a sample population that is not representative of all program directors or the programs they represent. When comparing program director demographics to national survey data, there were no significant differences in reported age or gender, but respondents to our survey reported fewer years as program directors ( p = 0.0002). 11,23 There was also no significant gender difference between responders and nonresponders in our invited survey population ( p = 0.06). Median program size was similar compared to national data from APDIM, but a higher proportion of programs in our survey were from university and community hospitals and a lower proportion of programs were from university-affiliated community and military hospitals ( p < 0.0001). 17 ", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our survey suggests that while women's health curricula aligned with the topics program directors expected residents to master and recommendations of national societies, availability of certain priority topics and opportunities remains limited in programs nationally. Women's health opportunities were more available in surveyed programs with a primary care track, but the extent to which women's health education should differ for primary care and categorical residents remains undefined. While most programs reflected in this survey utilized a variety of educational modalities, the optimal training methods to ensure IM resident competence in women's health will require further exploration. More research, especially qualitative studies of IM residents and faculty, is needed to explore barriers to expansion of women's health education. We strongly advocate for increased collaboration among resident educators across specialties and institutions on curriculum development and evaluation measures for clinical competency. With over 20 years of documented deficits in IM resident women's health education, continued advancement will likely require both local and national champions to determine how to best meet the training needs of physicians who will care for women.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Funding", "text": "The survey incentive was funded by an award from the Graduate Research and Scholarship Awards (GRASA) from the Boston University School of Education, awarded Fall 2014.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Women's health in the curriculum: Resource guide for faculty: Undergraduate, residency, and continuing education", "journal": "", "year": "1996", "authors": "G D Donoghue"}, {"title": "What internists need to know: Core competencies in women's health.

[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is thought to be more common in women due to numerous pathomechanics 7 : smaller gluteal tendinous insertion on the femur to dissipate tensile load; shorter gluteal moment arm resulting in reduced mechanical efficiency 8 ; increased peripheral adiposity, and a lower femoral neck shaft angle. 9 Misdiagnosis and lack of recognition of GTPS are common, due to the numerous differential diagnoses around the hip joint, and difficulty localizing the pathological structure causing the pain. 10,11 There are many diagnostic tests used to assess arthritic and nonarthritic hip conditions, however, few have been evaluated in the GTPS population. [12][13][14][15] A number of clinical tests exist for the diagnosis of GTPS, however, there is limited analysis of their value in this condition. 12,[15][16][17] The commonly accepted clinical presentation is pain in the greater trochanteric region with pain on palpation of the greater trochanter, however, this has recently been redefined to include ''in the absence of difficulty with manipulating shoes and socks'' in an attempt to differentiate from hip osteoarthritis. 13 Pain in the greater trochanteric region during the Patrick's or FABER test is also identified as a key indicator 13,15 and a systematic review by Reiman et al. 18 demonstrated the ability to modify the post-test probability of a gluteal tendinopathy diagnosis using the resisted external derotation test. More recently, Grimaldi et al. 19 assessed the utility of numerous clinical tests and reported palpation of the greater trochanter to be highly sensitive (80%) and single leg stance of 30 seconds on the affected limb to be highly specific (100%) for the condition. 19 However, as no single test leads to a definitive diagnosis, a battery of tests is recommended for clinical assessment of hip abductor function. There is a need for further exploration of the use of clinical tests for efficient and accurate diagnosis of GTPS, and to confirm the findings of previous studies. 13,15,18,19 Despite known limitations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the reference standard in tendon disorders, 15 such imaging is used to diagnose GTPS. 16,17,[20][21][22] MRI can identify tendon pathology (peritendinitis, tendinosis, and partial and complete tears) and pathology in associated structures (bursal fluid, enthesopathic changes along the greater trochanteric insertion, fatty atrophy of the muscle), thought to be involved in GTPS. 16,20 MRI has a reported accuracy of 91%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 92% for diagnosing hip abductor tendon tears, 17 but detection of abnormalities on MRI may be a poor predictor of trochanteric pain, as abnormalities are also present in asymptomatic patients. 12,15,21 Woodley et al. 15 reported that 82.5% of symptomatic patients had abnormal MRI findings in their study. However, 72.5% of asymptomatic patients also had abnormal MRI findings, indicating that pathology is not always reflective of clinical symptoms. Recent evidence investigating diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests with MRI as the gold standard may not provide an accurate evaluation of such tests for GTPS. 19 Greater trochanteric pain is a common complaint that presents to medical and allied health practitioners. There is limited knowledge about the accuracy of the current tests and investigations to diagnose GTPS, and this may result in misdiagnosis and ineffective interventions. The aim of this study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests that can be used in the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome in women. This study will further compare these clinical tests to MR findings in women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome.", "n_publication_ref": 44, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "A total of 46 female participants who responded to a community advertising flyer or who were referred by health professional practices (general practitioners, physiotherapists) were recruited for the study between May 1st and August 18th, 2014; 28 participants with greater trochanteric pain and 18 asymptomatic participants.

From these preliminary results, the four most valuable tests for the diagnosis of GTPS are palpation of the greater trochanter, Patrick's or FABER test, resisted hip abduction test, and the resisted external derotation test. Moderately valuable tests include resisted hip internal rotation test, single leg stance test, and modified resisted external derotation test (compression and contraction components). The least valuable clinical tests were the standard and modified Ober's test. These findings should be viewed in light of variability across some of the tests with wide CIs for some sensitivity and specificity values and inclusion of the null value for OR and LR CIs for the two Ober's tests and LRs of the single leg stance test. The resisted hip abduction test, displayed considerably large CIs for OR and LR, but was still included in the four recommended tests based on reasonable specificity, PPV, and NPV values.\nExcessive compression is thought to be important in the development of insertional tendinopathies. 39 Clinical tests thought to compress the gluteus medius and minimus tendons included the static component of the modified external derotation test, Ober's tests, and palpation. Pain on greater trochanter palpation is reported to be a key indicator of GTPS 1,2,5,12,14,[23][24][25]40 and an inclusion criterion for many GTPS studies. It is not surprising that palpation tenderness was found to be the most sensitive test in this study and in the most recent article by Grimaldi et al. 19 Direct pressure over and surrounding the greater trochanter is likely to cause compression of the tendinous insertions, reproducing symptoms in individuals with greater trochanteric pain. Pressure pain thresholds have been used in the gluteal tendons, 24 and the other tendons [41][42][43] as an assessment tool to monitor effectiveness of treatment interventions. Palpation was also the most likely test to elicit pain from asymptomatic participants, increasing the number of false-positive results and lowering the PPV.\nDuring the modified resisted external derotation test, the hip is passively taken into 90\u00b0of flexion and full adduction. Due to the widespread gluteal and lumbodorsal fascial connections, 44 this may increase compressive load of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. Previous research has shown an increase in subligamentous forces from 4 N to 106 N 45 during 0-40\u00b0hip adduction. The combination of flexion and adduction forces may further increase this compressive load. Lower sensitivity found during resisted external derotation  15 This study reported low sensitivity values for both tests, however, a +LR of 5.4 (standard Ober's test) and 5.6 (modified Ober's test) would be considered to have moderate effect on posttest probability of GTPS. 46 CIs for +LR cross the null value of 1, so at this stage, these tests could not be used confidently in the diagnosis of GTPS. Also, a -LR of 0.9 for both tests, had no effect on posttest probability. 46 Although a clinical association of hip abductor dysfunction, iliotibial band (ITB) compression 47 and tensor fascia latae (TFL) relative hypertrophy has been reported, 48 results suggest the Ober's Test positioning may not provide enough tendinous compression to elicit pain. Additionally, the length of the ITB and TFL may limit the amount of adduction able to take place during these tests.\nThe single leg stance test might briefly mimic the gluteal tendon compression and contraction 49 that occurs particularly during walking and single leg stance activities, secondary to poor femoropelvic control. 48 However, it does not account for the dynamic element of pelvic rotation that occurs in gait. Our study allowed participants to place their fingertips on a wall on the side of the symptomatic hip for balance, potentially reducing compression that occurs with symptomatic hip adduction. This test was found to be useful for ruling out the condition, but not ruling it in. These results reflect those in a recent study by Grimaldi et al., 19 where they found 100% specificity and 38% sensitivity during a 30-second single leg stance test. In comparison, Lequesne et al. 14 showed 100% of their 17 participants to have a reproduction of pain during a single leg stance test. Differences may be due to population-Lequesne et al. 14 did not test an asymptomatic population.\nMore recently, a positive Patrick's or FABER test has been used to define GTPS during clinical examination. 13 In our analysis, the test showed high specificity and the second highest sensitivity. Furthermore, the likelihood ratios suggest a small increase in the likelihood of the disease with a positive finding and minimal decrease in the likelihood of the disease with a negative finding. 37 For example, if pretest probability for a postmenopausal woman presenting with localized greater trochanteric pain with no hip joint range restriction having GTPS was estimated as 60%, a positive Patrick's or FABER test would be considered to have slight to moderate effect on posttest probability, 46 increasing to 80% when using a nomogram and the LR+ of 3.0. A negative test result with an LR-of 0.6 has a slight effect on posttest probability, 46 and reduces the chance to 30% on a nomogram.  Pain reproduction during this test may involve elongation and/ or compression of the tendon and bursae. When passive external rotation range is completed at 90\u00b0hip flexion, gluteus minimus muscle excursion lengthens up to 30 mm when compared with external rotation at neutral hip position. 50 Anatomically, an external rotation movement opposes the internal rotator pull of the anterior gluteus medius and minimus, 51 imposing an elongation force on their respective tendons. The elongation and potential compression of underlying thickened pathological bursae may result in a pain response. However, during 0-20\u00b0of abduction (a component of the final position of the Patrick's or FABER test), they have been found to shorten 15 mm. The contrast in findings between the three movements, provides a confusing picture as to the reasons Patrick's or FABER elicits greater trochanteric pain. 50 The finding of Beck et al. 50 of lengthening muscle fibers during flexion and external rotation can also be applied to the resisted internal rotation test, and the standard and modified resisted external derotation tests. During all three tests, the gluteus minimus tendon may be exposed to increased compression over the anterior and lateral facets of the greater trochanter as they wrap around the anterosuperior aspect of the hip joint. 52 Furthermore, the gluteus medius tendon and trochanteric bursae are likely to be compressed during adduction as the tendon wraps around the posterolateral aspect of the greater trochanter.\nClinical tests that involved contraction of the deep gluteal musculature against therapist resistance demonstrated high specificity and moderate sensitivity for pain reproduction. Conversely, previous studies have reported a positive relationship between pain reproduction with resisted hip abduction and presence of GTPS 2,12 or gluteal tendon tear (sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 46.2%). 12 This is likely due to methodological differences-Karpinski 2 did not specify the method of hip abduction testing and Bird et al. 12 completed testing in supine. Additionally, Bird et al. 12 and Lequesne et al. 14 recruited participants from tertiary referral centers, unlike this study, where participants were recruited from a community population. This may influence the symptomology of the included participants-those that have presented to tertiary referral centers, may have higher levels of pain and dysfunction and increased sensitivity of these clinical tests.\nIsometric internal rotation and tests that involved a dynamic contraction from an externally rotated position to hip neutral had varying results-either elevating or reducing pain response. Reduction in pain may reflect a lessening of tendon compression as the anterior portion of gluteus medius and minimus contract to internally rotate out of the compressed position. 51 Elevated pain response may be indicative of a fully ruptured tendon, whereby the primary internal rotator function is inhibited and compensatory abductor recruitment and muscle patterning may be used.\nThe association between tendon pathology on imaging (tendinosis) and symptomatic tendon pain (tendinopathy) on clinical examination has been challenged in the literature. Mayordormo 53 found gluteal bursal enlargement in 30% of their asymptomatic control group and Woodley 15 reported gluteus medius and minimus tendinopathy, tendon tears, bursitis, and mild osteoarthritis in the asymptomatic hips of subjects with unilateral greater trochanteric pain. Analogous to the presence of degenerative disc disease [54][55][56] and rotator cuff tears 57 of the shoulder in asymptomatic populations, false-positive results for 15 of 17 asymptomatic participants in this study, reflects the lack of an association between clinical and imaging findings in this condition.\nBased on the results of the current study, undertaking of a series of pain provocation tests (palpation of the greater trochanter, Patrick's or FABER, resisted hip abduction and the modified resisted external derotation test) could be useful for diagnosing GTPS. Radiological investigation with a MRI scan, may be of little value to the management of this condition, however, is an important tool to rule out more sinister pathologies (e.g., tumor, infection) 58 and other potential causes of hip pain (e.g., lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac joint pathology).

This may be ameliorated with a larger sample size, by reducing the likelihood of needing this computation to run validity analyses.

We examined the association between IPV exposure and 5-year weight gain in young women. We also examined whether depressive mood conferred additional increases in weight gain. Materials and Methods: Analyses were conducted among women in Project EAT, a longitudinal cohort study of weight-related health, which has collected data at three 5-year survey waves: ''EAT I'' (mean age 15 years), ''EAT II'' (mean age 19 years), and ''EAT III'' (mean age 25 years). Height and body weight were self-reported at each survey wave. IPV victimization and depressive mood were assessed on the EAT II survey. The study comprised women with data on IPV and body mass index (BMI) (N = 619). Linear regression analyses examined (1) 5-year (EAT II to EAT III) BMI change as a function of IPV exposure and (2) 5-year BMI change as a function of depressive mood at EAT II in women with and without IPV exposure.

Women exposed to both physical and sexual IPV at EAT II gained 1.1 kg/m 2 (95% CI -0.2 to 2.4) more, over 5 years, than women unexposed to IPV, although this did not reach statistical significance. Among those with IPV exposure, depressive mood at EAT II was associated with an additional increase in BMI of 1.8 kg/m 2 (95% CI 0.2-3.4) relative to no depressive mood.

[2][3][4] Probable mechanisms for an IPV-obesity association include unhealthy strategies for coping with stress such as overconsumption of high-energy foods in an attempt to relieve negative emotions. 5,6 Depressive mood, which is common among those exposed to IPV 7,8 and has been linked to weight gain in some (although not all) studies, [9][10][11] may also exacerbate unhealthy coping strategies and the weight-related impacts of IPV.\nAlthough there is a large literature on the impact of violence from a parent during childhood on weight-related outcomes, 12 studies on the association of violence from an intimate partner with weight status are more limited. We know of only a handful of studies that have examined weight as a function of IPV. Six have examined cross-sectional associations of IPV with weight status, 3,[13][14][15][16] with four finding a positive association. 3,[14][15][16] Two studies (one cross sectional, one longitudinal) have examined combined ''interpersonal'' violence exposure, without differentiating IPV from other types of violence exposure. Both found an association with body weight. 17,18 To our knowledge, only one longitudinal study has examined the relationship between IPV and weight change. This study, which used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, assessed physical and sexual IPV in adolescence and its impact on weight during the transition to adulthood; it found that women exposed to IPV had an overall 0.4 kg/m 2 greater 15-year body mass index (BMI) change than women unexposed to IPV. 2 Additional longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nThe current literature also lacks studies examining how depression may operate in concert with IPV exposure to predict weight change. Depression has been found to be associated with problematic overeating [19][20][21] and overweight. 9,22,23 It is plausible that IPV-exposed women who suffer from depressive symptoms are at particularly high risk for weight gain, as depressive symptoms may impede women's capacity to cultivate healthy coping strategies. Depression may also be a marker for the most severe IPV experiences that place women at particularly high risk.\nA better understanding of the association between IPV and weight status-including the role of depression-could inform interventions to prevent obesity-related disease risk in adulthood among the large number of women with IPV exposure. For example, existing interventions to improve mental health outcomes after IPV could potentially integrate obesity prevention strategies (e.g., strategies for addressing disordered overeating) to improve overall health outcomes in this highrisk population. Likewise, obesity prevention and intervention strategies might be more effective if appropriately tailored, for example, ''trauma-informed,'' for those with IPV histories by addressing the unique factors that contribute to weight gain in this population (e.g., depressive symptoms). We therefore aimed to estimate the association of physical and sexual IPV with 5-year weight change among women in Project EAT, a longitudinal cohort focused on weight-related health. In addition, we were interested in whether depressive mood conferred additional weight-related risks; we therefore examined the association between depressive symptoms and 5-year weight change in women with and without IPV exposure.", "n_publication_ref": 30, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sample", "text": "Our study used data from surveys administered by Project EAT, a longitudinal cohort study of adolescents initially recruited from Minneapolis-St. Paul public middle and high schools serving socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse communities. Of the 53 schools that were invited to participate, 31 agreed to take part. The surveys were administered at three time points, each 5 years apart, referred to as EAT I, 24,25 EAT II, 26 and EAT III, 27,28 respectively. Project EAT I was conducted in the 1998-1999 school year, with surveys administered in schools in health, physical education, and science classrooms. All students in participating classes were eligible to participate. For Project EAT II, 5 years later, the original participants were resurveyed by mailed questionnaire. EAT III resurveyed participants once again at 10 years from baseline; participants were mailed letters inviting them to complete online or paper versions of the Project EAT III survey. Survey development was guided by theory, pilot testing, and focus groups. 29,30 Participants aged 18+ years were asked about IPV on the EAT II survey. The sample for the present study included women in this age group (N = 940), who responded to both the EAT II and EAT III questionnaire (N = 756). We restricted analyses to women, because preliminary data analysis in men indicated that the numbers reporting IPV, particularly sexual IPV, were too limited (N = 20) to obtain stable estimates. Participants who were pregnant or breastfeeding at EAT II or EAT III were excluded (N = 102). In addition, women who did not complete IPV information at EAT II (N = 21) or body weight information at either EAT II or EAT III (N = 14) were not included in the data analysis. This left 619 women for our analytic sample.\nWomen in our analytic sample were on average 20.3 years old and almost 30% nonwhite (8% black, 3% Hispanic, 13% Asian, and 4% other or mixed). Just over half had parents with less than a college education. Women who responded to all three Project EAT surveys (a requirement for inclusion in our sample) were more likely to be white and have parents with at least a college education than the original sample. Analyses were weighted to adjust for loss to follow-up, which corrected this distribution back to that of the original sample.\nMeasures BMI change. BMI change was calculated as the difference between BMI at EAT III and BMI at EAT II in kilograms per meters squared (kg/m 2 ) based on self-reported weight and height. At EAT III, a substudy was conducted to validate the self-reported weight and height by measuring 125 participants and comparing their actual measurements and their self-reported measurements to establish the accuracy of their BMI; the validation study showed a high correlation between self-reported and measured BMI (r = 0.98 for females). 31 We chose to examine BMI change from EAT II to EAT III as our outcome, rather than BMI at EAT III alone, because we could be sure that change in BMI after EAT II (when IPV was measured) reflected the hypothesized temporal order-from IPV to BMI-rather than the reverse.\nIPV exposure. IPV was assessed a single time at EAT II. Physical IPV was assessed with a question derived from the Conflict Tactics Scales 32 asking participants if a dating partner had ever hit, shoved, held down, or used some other physical force against them either in the past year or before the past year. In a separate sexual IPV question, derived from the Sexual Experiences Survey, 33 participants were asked if they have ever been forced to touch their dating partner sexually or if their dating partner forced some type of sexual behavior on them either in the past year or before the past year. Because small numbers of participants reported past-year IPV, we combined past-year and prior IPV to create a dichotomous variable for physical IPV (ever/ never) and sexual IPV (ever/never). In addition, we created a joint physical-sexual IPV variable to assess their independent and combined associations with BMI, categorizing women into four categories: no physical or sexual IPV, physical IPV alone, sexual IPV alone, and both physical and sexual IPV. Finally, we examined the association of any IPV with BMI change, where ''any IPV'' was defined with an indicator variable equal to one if a woman experienced either physical or sexual IPV.\nDepressive mood. Because depression is common among women with IPV exposure, 7 and has been linked, although inconsistently, to weight status, 22,23 we were interested in whether depressive mood conferred additional risk of weight gain over and above IPV exposure. We therefore examined the interaction between depressive mood and IPV in the prediction of weight change, and also conducted depression-BMI change analyses stratified by IPV. Depressive mood was measured with the Kandel and Davies Scale 34 at EAT II and dichotomized at the recommended cutoff for clinically significant depressive symptoms. Baseline covariates. We included the following baseline (EAT I) sociodemographic variables in adjusted models because they are potential confounders of the IPV-BMI change relationship: age (continuous), race/ethnicity (white, nonwhite), and socioeconomic status (SES) based on parental educational attainment (parent education <college degree vs.\n\u2021college degree).

We then ran a model regressing BMI change on the combined four-category physical and sexual violence variable, as well as a model regressing BMI change on an indicator for exposure to any IPV. For each of our exposures, we ran a crude model and a model adjusting for sociodemographic confounders plus BMI at study baseline. Models were weighted to adjust for loss to follow-up; weights were based on the inverse probability of response to each questionnaire cycle as a function of baseline age, race, and SES. Primary models were run as complete case analyses, that is, with adjusted models excluding observations with missing covariates (N = 44).\nWe ran two supplemental models to assess the sensitivity of our findings to various modeling decisions. First, we re-ran our models using missing indicators for the race and SES covariates to assess whether our results would change when the full sample was retained in adjusted models. Second, we excluded women with extreme values for the outcome (BMI change ->3 SD of the mean), to ensure our results were not driven by outliers.\nTo assess whether depressive mood was associated with BMI change in women with and without IPV, we first ran a model regressing 5-year BMI change on depressive mood, IPV, and their interaction term (plus sociodemographics and baseline BMI).

Even after adjustment for age, race, baseline SES, and baseline BMI, the association of joint exposure to both physical and sexual IPV with BMI change remained substantial (>1 kg/m 2 ), although no longer statistically significant, possibly due to limited power. Differences in BMI of this magnitude are associated with increases in type 2 diabetes risks of 10%-20% in women (with greater risks in some subpopulations such as Hispanics and Asians). 35 If these accelerated weight trajectories continue for women with histories of IPV, then they are likely to be at even greater risk for weight-related disease as they enter middle and older age.\nAmong women with IPV exposure, depressive mood was associated with a large additional increase in 5-year BMI change. It is not clear from our data whether depressive mood is simply a marker of more severe IPV, or plays a more mechanistic role (e.g., is a pathway by which IPV influences  weight gain because depressive symptoms undermine healthy coping strategies). In either case, these findings suggest that women with IPV histories who experience depressive mood would benefit substantially from targeted obesity prevention, although future work is needed to identify the types of prevention strategies that are most likely to be effective in this group. If depressive mood is indeed on the pathway between IPV and weight gain, then intervening on depressive symptoms themselves may be an important obesity prevention tool in women with IPV histories. The reasons for the observed lack of association between depressive mood and BMI change in women without IPV exposure are unclear, but may reflect milder symptoms in this group, or different phenotypic expressions of depressive symptoms.\nOur results are consistent with prior literature, which has found that IPV exposure is associated with weight-related behaviors 36 and obesity-related chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease. 13,37,38 Our results are also consistent with a crosssectional study, in which a substantial association was found between IPV exposure and obesity ( \u202130 kg/m 2 ) in women; however, this study was among Egyptian women, and it is unknown if the results are generalizable to women in the United States. A single prior longitudinal study also found small accelerations in 15-year BMI change associated with a history of IPV in adolescence. 2 Several other published studies have focused on the association of IPV exposure on psychological outcomes of abuse, for example, depression, anxiety, and somatization. 7,8,39,40 To our knowledge, this study is only the second longitudinal examination of weight change as a function of IPV.\nOur study was limited by the use of single-item questions rather than full validated scales to measure physical and sexual IPV. Use of full IPV scales may have picked up additional IPV experiences that participants did not report on our single-item measures; it is unclear whether such experiences would be related to BMI in the same way as IPV captured by our singleitem measures. Nonetheless, the prevalence of IPV found in our sample was similar in our study to estimates in national samples, 2,41 providing some reassurance that our measures are performing similarly to more extensive scales. Self-reported BMI may be prone to error; while validation studies in the overall sample suggest accurate self-report, women with depression may be less accurate in their reporting and influence the results of our stratified analysis. Restriction of our analytic sample to those who responded to all three Project EAT questionnaires resulted in a select group; in particular, comparisons of our analytic sample to responders to the original Project EAT survey suggest that our analytic sample was more likely to be white and have higher parental education than the original Project EAT sample. However, after weighting to correct for loss to follow-up, the analytic sample was similar to the original respondents on these characteristics. Restricting our analysis to women, due to the small number of IPV reports among men in this cohort, is an additional limitation, and future studies should examine these associations in larger samples of men.\nDespite its limitations, our study has several notable strengths, including a community-based sample, prospectively measured IPV, and BMI self-reports that perform well against measured BMI in the overall sample. Furthermore, longitudinal data allowed for identification of the temporal order from IPV to weight change; our ability to adjust for baseline BMI, which may predict later BMI trajectory, provides additional support for this temporal order. Although small sample sizes in our IPV-exposed group resulted in wide confidence intervals around our IPV estimates, our results suggest a clinically important association that warrants further investigation.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The present study suggests that women who experience physical and sexual IPV in conjunction with depressive mood are significantly more vulnerable to accelerated weight gain than women who do not have this constellation of experiences.

Progesterone, one of the key hormones in pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age. Methods: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring, apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the effects of gestational age and maternal weight. Results: Twenty-seven cases and 64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM = 0.71, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls. Conclusions: Progesterone levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "O bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep related breathing disorder in which the upper airway is repeatedly obstructed during sleep. OSA is characterized by various degrees of airflow limitation, intermittent hypoxemia, and repeated arousals. Sleep disordered breathing, a spectrum of disorders that encompasses snoring, OSA, and other disorders, is more prevalent in pregnant than in nonpregnant women (35% vs. 9%). 1,2 Several factors associated with physiologic changes of pregnancy may contribute to this higher prevalence. Nasal congestion, 3 reduction in upper airway size, 4 more advanced Mallampati scores, 5 and decreased functional residual capacity 6 are all factors that may contribute to the de novo development or worsening of preexisting sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disordered breathing, including OSA, is associated with an elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes, possibly leading to adverse neonatal outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction and premature delivery. [7][8][9][10] Progesterone is a crucial reproductive hormone in pregnancy with levels reaching 6-to 8-fold preconception levels due to placental contribution in its secretion. 11 It is also a key factor in stimulating ventilation at the level of the central chemoreceptors on the ventrolateral surface of the medulla, 12 leading to increased minute ventilation, decreased end-tidal carbon dioxide, and lowered upper airway resistance. 13,14 As such, it is possible that progesterone may play a protective role against sleep disordered breathing. 1 There are multiple proposed mechanisms by which increased progesterone levels may inhibit the development of sleep disordered breathing. Ventilatory drive stimulation and increased minute ventilation may be one of the protective mechanisms. 15 Furthermore, progesterone enhances the responsiveness of the upper airway dilator muscles to chemical stimuli during sleep, reducing upper airway resistance. 16,17 Though increased progesterone levels create a state of respiratory alkalosis that may theoretically favor central apneas, we recently demonstrated that pregnant women were unlikely to be diagnosed with central sleep apnea compared to matched nonpregnant controls. 18 Studies involving exogenous administration of progesterone directly suggest a protective role of progesterone on breathing control and the prevalence of obstructive events. In postmenopausal women with chronic hypercapnic respiratory and partial airway obstruction during sleep, administration of medroxyprogesterone has been associated with improved carbon dioxide levels. 19,20 Given this potential protective role, we hypothesized that OSA status would impact levels of progesterone in pregnancy. The main aims of this study were to examine the relationship between progesterone levels and body mass index (BMI) and assess the association between OSA status and progesterone levels.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This is a case control study aimed at evaluating progesterone levels in women with OSA and low risk controls that were enrolled at two large teaching hospitals.

Individual medical records were reviewed to confirm a diagnosis of OSA (i.e., positive polysomnography report or documentation of an outpatient continuous positive airways pressure [CPAP] prescription for sleep apnea). Given the limited documentation regarding details of OSA diagnosis and treatment in the available obstetric medical records on retrospective review, an accurate timing of OSA diagnosis in relation to timing of pregnancy (diagnosis preceding or during pregnancy) could not be determined.

MoM is a measure of how far an individual value deviates from the median value obtained in a control, reference population. Given the dynamic nature of screening markers results in pregnancy, variation in analytical performance of immunoassays used for testing, and specific population characteristics, an individual's test result may vary widely; hence MoM can normalize an individual test by comparing it to a representative population's median value. Therefore, a patient's MoM would then be reported as patient result/population median. A single set of log-linear medians was fitted to the combined first and second trimester data for controls. The progesterone values were converted to MoM levels by dividing by the expected median value for a given gestational age. These MoM levels were then regressed against maternal weight and a reciprocal model fitted. 25 All progesterone values, including those from cases, were then converted to gestational age and maternal weight adjusted MoM levels.

We found a positive  correlation of progesterone with gestational age, as expected, and a negative correlation with maternal weight. Convention in prenatal screening is to express maternal serum markers as MoM to account for gestational age and weight effects, as for example, when discussing alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol 26 ; however, this has not been the case for earlier studies of progesterone and sleep disordered breathing research. Expressing progesterone as MoM in accordance with convention for other maternal serum markers, as performed in this study, should be strongly considered for future clinical use and analysis, since interpretation of progesterone as raw, unadjusted values may not provide an accurate assessment of adequate progesterone secretion.\nProgesterone levels remain a valuable way to assess pregnancy health, as deficiency may play a role in specific pathologies such as recurrent pregnancy loss. 27 In current clinical practice, progesterone levels are interpreted as raw values, and patient characteristics such as gestational age and maternal weight are not factored into the interpretation. In this study, we have confirmed the expected increase in progesterone levels with increasing gestational age. We have also demonstrated that higher weight in pregnant women is, in general, associated with lower progesterone levels and vice versa. This negative correlation may be due to a simple dilution from the larger blood volume of heavier women, as is routinely observed for Down syndrome screening markers. In prenatal screening for Down syndrome and open neural tube defects, adjusting levels of maternal serum markers by covariates such as maternal weight has been shown to improve screening performance. 28 We have controlled for weight in this study by using linear regression.\nAs hypothesized, our study has shown significantly lower progesterone levels in women with OSA compared to controls. Our progesterone MoM of 0.71 for cases in the first trimester indicates that progesterone levels in women with OSA are 29% lower than matched controls during this period. Similarly, a progesterone MoM of 0.84 in the second trimester indicates that levels in women with OSA are 16% lower than matched controls during this time. These findings suggest that women with higher levels of progesterone may be protected against OSA. As lower progesterone levels are associated with heavier weight, it is possible that lower progesterone levels may in part mediate the association between obesity and OSA in pregnancy. However, progesterone levels remained lower in women with OSA even after correction for maternal weight.\nWe cannot discount the possibility that OSA may have impacted placental secretion of progesterone. This putative effect may occur via oxidative stress, sympathetic stimulation, or inflammation. Our previous work showed that women with OSA had alterations in placental secretory function evidenced by altered pregnancy associated plasma protein A and estriol levels as compared to low risk controls. 29,30 We have also demonstrated evidence of fetal normoblastemia-a marker of chronic hypoxia on placental histopathology-and cellular hypoxia evidenced by altered carbonic anhydrase IX in placentas of women with OSA. 31 It is therefore possible that reduced progesterone occurs in response to placental damage from OSA, rather than, or in addition to having a causative effect.\nAs it was difficult to ascertain the timing of OSA development in relation to pregnancy in our cohort, our data cannot determine a temporal relationship between OSA and progesterone secretion to help address the question of causality. The association of OSA and progesterone levels may also differ depending on the timing of OSA development and diagnosis in relation to pregnancy. We did, however, find a somewhat larger effect in the first compared to the second trimester. Additional studies are needed to confirm this finding, especially since only a single sample was evaluated in each trimester. Other possible confounding variables of progesterone secretion, such as circadian rhythm, pulsatile secretion, and metabolic clearance could be addressed with multiple samples from each subject within a trimester. While progesterone levels have not appeared to follow consistent circadian patterns, levels may fluctuate with pulsatile secretion and decrease after meals. [32][33][34] Lastly, our data are complicated by the fact that meaningful data on continuous airway pressure therapy use, duration, or compliance could not be reliably ascertained by a review of the obstetrical medical record among our subjects due to poor documentation, prohibiting any useful analysis of the effect of therapy on the described association. However, in this study, CPAP prescription among OSA cases may have perhaps led to a reduction in effect size and ultimately an underestimation of study results.\nThis study was limited by the use of stored convenience samples. Hence, only a limited subset of subjects had residual serum samples available for progesterone testing and inclusion in this study (48% of subjects with confirmed OSA diagnosis and 20% of controls had residual samples for testing). Given the large proportion of controls excluded from this study, selection bias in determining the study control group in particular is possible. However, comparison of included controls with available residual serum and excluded controls without available residual serum shows overall similar maternal demographics, comorbidities, and similar maternal and neonatal outcomes. Additionally, our control subjects at low risk for OSA originated from a convenience sample screened by questionnaires rather than polysomnography, due to lack of funding to perform polysomnography on asymptomatic women. Therefore, it is possible that a small number of control subjects could have had undiagnosed OSA not picked up by the multivariable apnea prediction index survey. If present, this would lead to a reduced estimate of the effect size.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study demonstrated a positive association of progesterone levels with gestational age through the first and second trimesters and a negative correlation between progesterone levels and maternal weight. In addition, lower progesterone levels in women with OSA, after accounting for gestational age and maternal weight, may suggest a protective role of this hormone against OSA.\nUltimately, the relationship between low progesterone levels and OSA is important to confirm, as progesterone may serve as an inexpensive method to identify pregnant women at higher risk of OSA and may be used in conjunction with other clinical predictors to triage women for diagnostic testing. In addition, as exogenous progesterone supplementation has been shown to improve upper airway obstruction during sleep and lower carbon dioxide levels by improving ventilation in the nonpregnant population, this therapy could also be evaluated in pregnancy. The use of such therapy would be simplified by the already approved use of progesterone in women with a history of preterm labor. Other future research may expand the focus to other hormones with a potential to impact respiratory control and upper airway obstruction, such as leptin. 35,36 ", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "", "text": "Acknowledgments J.L.: Grant funding from the NIH NHLBI (T35HL094308).

Methods: In this pilot study, 40 postpartum women credentialed to receive postpartum women, infants, and children (WIC) service were randomized to usual care (''WIC Moms'') or a personalized health intervention delivered via a SmartPhone (''E-Moms'').

[2][3][4] The most successful weight management programs are intensive, employing frequent in-person contact, a specific dietary prescription, and individualized feedback on body weight change and dietary intake. [5][6][7][8] Intensive in-person programs have several limitations including financial and geographical barriers that prevent many individuals from obtaining these services. In-person interventions do not typically provide timely treatment advice to individuals and have limited scalability, making dissemination of the lifestyle intervention to large numbers of individuals costly and impractical.

The application included near real-time weight and activity monitoring, scheduled delivery of health information, and interventionist feedback.\nTo track weight and activity, participants were provided a BodyTrace \u00aa scale and a Fitbit Zip \u00d2 accelerometer.

Both analyses drew the same statistical conclusion unless otherwise stated.\nThe primary outcome, change in weight following the 4month intervention, was investigated in several ways. First, a linear mixed model was used to compare absolute change in weight between the intervention and control groups. A simple model with only fixed effects for treatment group, time, and their interaction was constructed. A random subject effect was included to account for intra-individual correlations over time. Using adjusted means from the model, two-sample ttests were used to compare the two groups. This same method was used to assess absolute change in secondary outcome body fat percentage, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.\nIn addition to comparisons of outcomes between treatment groups, differences in outcomes based on intervention adherence were investigated post hoc. Adherence was defined in terms of the number of days participants weighed themselves and the number of days participants' step counts were recorded from the FitBit Zip. An expected number of days for logged weights and recorded steps was determined for each participant. Based on the distribution of data, women were divided into three adherence groups defined to meaningfully categorize the participants, while maintaining a near balance in adherence group sample sizes.

Other mHealth weight loss interventions have found similar results, reporting a net weight loss of no more than 2 kg after a 6-month health intervention when compared to control. [23][24][25][26] Due to negligible weight change, it is not surprising that body composition indicators and blood pressure were also unaffected.\nThe majority of participants (71%) did not breastfeed or stopped breastfeeding before study start. Due to study enrollment occurring at 8 weeks postpartum, the intervention did not focus on breastfeeding as most breastfeeding practices were established before study start. The effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss in our study is difficult to isolate from other confounding factors, and thus, the available evidence is heterogeneous and does not show a strong association between breastfeeding and postpartum weight loss. 27 Larger, more robust studies are needed to assess the influence of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss.\nIntervention adherence was variable among participants with objective data transmitted from the body weight scale and accelerometer showing that some individuals were engaged at least 5 days per week and others not engaged at all. The women who had high adherence to self-monitoring did see a modest reduction in their body weight, body fat percentage, and hip circumference throughout the 16-week postpartum intervention when compared to the WIC Moms group who experienced weight gain. Individuals who had high adherence to the E-Moms intervention decreased body fat percentage by 2.5%, which is consistent with other weight loss trials that achieved caloric restriction through diet and exercise modifications. 28,29 Age at study enrollment was the only significant baseline characteristic difference between the adherence groups. However, with the small sample size and limited number of participants with high adherence, discerning demographic differences between the adherence groups is limited. In addition, other behaviors and characteristics not assessed during the study could further explain adherence and outcome differences.\nWhether deployed in an mHealth or in-person intervention, increased self-monitoring, including weight and physical activity monitoring, has been associated with increased weight loss and successful weight management. [30][31][32][33][34] As expected, similar to self-monitoring, an increased intervention engagement is associated with an increased weight loss. [35][36][37] Despite near real-time feedback and increased frequency of communication and access to health information, mHealth interventions have the potential to be more passive than inperson interventions. Participants may more easily disengage by ignoring remote communication attempts (i.e., texts, emails, and phone calls) and decrease adherence to recommendations without the accountability of a face-to-face intervention, especially as the study progresses. 38,39 mHealth interventions may struggle to provide a dynamic intervention that motivates and encourages the participant to meet goals and remain engaged. [40][41][42] While barriers to adherence and participation to the E-Moms intervention were not directly assessed, independent qualitative studies report barriers such as lack of knowledge and skills (which alludes to issues of health disparities), lack of child care or presence of other family duties, lack of time or work schedules, inadequate access to the needed foods, and stress. 43,44 Indeed, it is likely that many, if not all, of these factors may have impacted the desire and ability of E-Moms participants' to participate fully in the intervention. As a result, mHealth research and developers are charged to develop weight management interventions that integrate pillars of successful weight management interventions (e.g., self-monitoring and frequent, near realtime personalized feedback) with consistent motivation and reasons for engagement.\nPertinent to the WIC population who face health disparities, behavior change interventions should be more carefully developed with input from these groups to help overcome many of the stated barriers. Strategies to improve intervention engagement may include the use of peer-led programs, addition of a gamification component, deepening staff and participant relationships with video conferencing or in-person activities, 45 use of social networking or involvement of family and/or friends to increase social support, 43,46 delivery of participant-centered nutrition and health information, 47 and additional assistance with recommended foods for weight loss such as fruits, vegetables, and portioncontrolled foods. Herring et al. 48 deployed a similar, yet successful (-3.6 kg difference between treatment and usual care), technology-based weight loss intervention in urban low-income mothers, which engaged participants via social networking (Facebook support group), and provided an incentive to respond to health coaches' text by conducting raffles for gift certificates on a monthly basis. As observed in the current trial, intervention adherence led to greater weight loss.\nWhile intensive, in-person lifestyle interventions are the most effective behavioral weight loss treatment, frequent inperson counseling led by a trained interventionist is not always possible. 49 To decrease the burden on both the clinician and the client, the efficacy of alternative modes of weight management intervention delivery such as mHealth-based interventions for pregnant and postpartum moms are being tested. 50,51 In this pilot and feasibility study, we successfully partnered with local WIC clinics and deployed a mHealth weight management intervention. In a population that is traditionally difficult to recruit and retain, 50,52 40 women were enrolled within 1 year and 88% of the participants completed the 16-week study (95% retention in the intervention group). The increased retention in the E-Moms group may have been a result of an increased contact with the participants by nature of the study design, and the majority of the participants in the intervention were loaned a SmartPhone that provided a consistent mode of contact. In most cases, contact with the WIC Moms group was lost due to changes in address and phone numbers, and women not returning to the local clinic for routine WIC appointments, preventing follow-up. Similar retention and engagement challenges have been reported by Foster et al., including gaps in communication due to monthly renewal of limited cellular plans and lost cell phones. 53 WIC serves *2 million women of childbearing age in the United States 54 and the average interpregnancy interval in the United States is 34 months. 55 Therefore, the postpartum period of one pregnancy is also the prepregnancy period of another. With children eligible for WIC benefits until their fifth birthday, the likelihood that a woman will become pregnant again before ending WIC benefits with her first child is high. Together with the observation that without intervention mothers gained 4-6 kg in the first year postpartum, 56,57 WIC is an ideal setting to integrate weight management programs aimed to attenuate the weight gain observed during the reproductive years, while improving preconception health of the mother. A programmatic shift to focus on weight management would positively impact the health of more than just the mother as the mother's weight status directly influences the health of her developing fetus [58][59][60] and her family. 61,62 Collaboration and increased communication (e.g., shared electronic medical records) with other subsidized programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and Healthy Start would improve the continuum of care and ease the financial and logistical burden of implementing a weight management program in WIC, potentially improving the health and well-being of millions of Americans.", "n_publication_ref": 41, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Overall, the E-Moms SmartLoss mHealth intervention was not able to decrease postpartum weight retention in women receiving WIC benefits compared to usual care received through the current WIC program. However, the intervention was effective in those women who were adherent to the intervention. Therefore, further development of mHealth lifestyle interventions to improve adherence is needed. Interventions that successfully engage WIC participants may complement standard of care and facilitate weight loss during the postpartum period and reduce postpartum weight retention. Given that this is also the likely interpregnancy interval for subsequent pregnancies, further research is needed to improve individual engagement and adherence to mHealth interventions for low socioeconomic women, to improve the health of millions served by WIC.

Methods: Women aged 21-65 years were recruited for a randomized trial comparing home self-collected HPV testing to standard clinician-collected Pap screening. Participants were surveyed about their attitudes toward self-collected HPV testing. Clinicians performing cervical cancer screening in University of Washington medical clinics were also surveyed to determine their acceptability of self-collected HPV testing. Results: Over half (59.1%) of the 1,769 women surveyed preferred self-collected HPV testing to cliniciancollected tests. Reasons most often cited were convenience or time saving (82.7%), and avoiding embarrassment or discomfort associated with pelvic exam (38.1%). Women who did not prefer self-collected HPV testing reported greater faith in clinician-collected samples (56.7%) or a desire for a clinic visit to address other issues (42.4%). One hundred eighteen (49.6%) of 238 physicians and midlevel providers surveyed completed the survey. The majority (78.0%) reported that they would recommend a self-collected HPV test if the test had qualities such as high sensitivity and cost effectiveness. Provider concerns mirrored those of patients, namely ensuring adequate sample collection and the opportunity to address other health concerns. Conclusion: Patients and clinicians are supportive of self-collected HPV testing. However, concerns regarding adequacy of samples that are self collected and the desire to see a provider in a clinic setting for other health needs highlight areas that need to be addressed if self collection proves to be a viable option for cervical cancer screening.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "O ver the last several decades human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been extensively studied and validated as an important component of cervical cancer screening. Studies have demonstrated that as compared to primary Papbased screening, primary HPV testing (done on cliniciancollected samples) provides superior sensitivity (although lower specificity) for detection of high-grade squamous lesions. 1,2 Although clinical practice has not yet changed from cytology-based screening in the United States, recently published guidelines have supported the use of primary HPV testing, based on cervical samples obtained in clinics by healthcare workers, as an alternative to Pap screening for cervical cancer control. 3 In addition, clinical trials and a meta-analysis have also shown that HPV testing performed on self-collected samples (collected from the vagina either in clinic or at home) provides similar results to that of testing using clinician collected cervical samples. [4][5][6] Another large trial of self-collected HPV samples in countries outside the United States suggests that this approach is likely to increase the number of women participating in screening and potentially reduce costs so there is a great deal of interest in further research. 7 Previous studies have suggested that women prefer selfcollected HPV samples for screening but little is known about whether this method would be endorsed by clinicians 4,8,9 Endorsement by providers is of particular concern given recent reports that examined clinician attitudes toward other recent changes to the cervical cancer screening recommendations related to age of onset of screening, screening intervals, and use of HPV testing. Results from these surveys documented significant push back by clinicians to new recommendations for longer screening intervals and later onset of screening because of fear that such changes would result in less face to face contact with patients 10,11 . Since at home selfcollected HPV testing may further reduce the number of women seeking in-clinic screening, it is possible that there will be serious objections by providers.\nThe present study was undertaken to evaluate both clinician and patient attitudes toward at home self-collected HPV testing as part of a National Institutes of Health funded randomized trial comparing clinician-obtained Pap tests to selfcollected HPV tests for cervical cancer screening.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Beginning in March of 2012, women aged 21-65 years presenting to two University of Washington clinics for routine cervical cancer screening were invited to participate in the HOPE (Home HPV or Pap Exam) trial, a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the accuracy and acceptability of home self-collected HPV testing compared to routine Pap testing. Additionally, women were recruited by direct mailing to University of Washington students and staff, local newspaper advertisements, local web advertisements, and community posted flyers.\nWomen who had prior screening within 1 year of enrollment, known immune suppression, were currently pregnant, had a hysterectomy, or a colposcopy procedure within 2 years or treatment of cervical dysplasia within 3 years were excluded from participation into the study. Wait times to schedule screening visits ranged from 3 days to 2 weeks for those seen in the research clinic and waits for specific University of Washington providers varied but detailed information is not available. After providing informed consent, women were randomized to receive either cervical cancer screening with a home self-collected HPV test, or a cliniciancollected Pap or Pap with HPV test per current guidelines. 12 All subjects were seen by a clinician at enrollment and received a screening exam with collection of ThinPrep\u00d4 (Hologic 1996, Bedford, MA) sample from cervix. Subjects were then randomized to receive routine Pap test or home selfcollect HPV test for screening. If women were randomized to the self-collect arm then the ThinPrep sample obtained was held in lab and run only as a reflex test if needed. At end of the study visit, these subjects were given a self-collect kit. Brief instructions were reviewed regarding how to return the sample box via standard USPS priority mail. Subjects were informed that the kit contained one double-sided instruction sheet with collection instructions on one side and shipping instructions on second side. No additional education on self-collection procedure was provided. The kits contained two individually wrapped sterile Dacron polyester swabs and a container for the sample. No storage instructions required since the sample is kept at ambient temperature.\nWomen were asked to complete a written or online survey following their first screening visit. The survey consisted of *40 questions regarding prior experiences associated with Pap testing, preferences for at home self-collected HPV testing or clinician-collected tests, and reasons for preferring one method of testing over the other. Participants were asked to complete all questions on the questionnaire regardless of which method of testing they preferred. Short answers to open-ended questions were summarized by thematic categorization. Data from participants who enrolled and completed surveys from the first round of screening are presented here. Subjects received up to $50 ($25 after study visit and $25 after completion of the questionnaire) as incentive for enrollment.\nClinicians performing cervical cancer screening in University of Washington medical clinics were surveyed online regarding the acceptability of self-collected HPV screening. The short survey consisted of two sets of questions. The demographic questions included gender, years in practice, specialty, frequency of performing Pap screening, and knowledge of the HOPE study. The second set included questions aimed at determining the characteristics that clinicians felt were important for a screening test and whether clinicians would recommend an at home self-collected HPV test if such a test had these characteristics.\nThe survey invitation was sent by email to 238 internal medicine (n = 78), family medicine (n = 77), and obstetric and gynecology ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Patient acceptability survey", "text": "One thousand eight-hundred nineteen women enrolled in the HOPE study and 1,769 (97.3%) responded to the acceptability survey. The mean age of women completing the survey was 35.7 years (Table 1). Women in the self-collected HPV and clinician-collected test arms were comparable in terms of age, ethnicity, and race (data not shown). Over 58% of the responders reported two or more Pap screens in the past 5 years and 15.8% reported a previous diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection. Twenty-nine percent of women overall reported receiving two or more doses of an HPV vaccination.\nTable 2 summarizes the results of the patient acceptability survey. Over 59% of study participants indicated that they would prefer a self-collected HPV test to a clinician-collected Pap test (40.9%). The most common reasons cited for preferring a self-collected HPV test were convenience or time saving (82.7%) and avoiding embarrassment or discomfort (38.1%) associated with a pelvic exam. The majority of women (74.0%) indicated that they would be more willing to participate in self-collected HPV screening if their provider recommended it. Women reported preference for cliniciancollected tests primarily for two reasons: they had more faith in provider-obtained samples (56.7%) and clinic visits allowed for discussion of other medical issues (42.4%).\nWomen who preferred the self-collected HPV test were more likely to report embarrassment ( p < 0.001) or pain and discomfort ( p = 0.01) with a pelvic exam (Table 3). Preference for self-collected HPV testing increased with increasing level of education ( p < 0.001) and household income ( p < 0.001) as well as a need to take time off from work ( p = 0.009). However, women with a prior history of a sexually transmitted infection were less likely to prefer self-collected HPV testing ( p = 0.04). Women who were assigned to and received a self-collected HPV test compared to those who were assigned to and received a clinician-collected test were more likely to prefer the self-collected HPV test ( p < 0.001). Test preference did not vary significantly by age, need for child-care arrangement, out-of-pocket expenses, or clinic type ( p > 0.05).\nWomen who were randomized to the self-collected HPV arm of the study reported positive experiences with the selfcollected HPV test. Of 881 women, 97.7% indicated that the ''instructions were easy to follow'' and only 6.7% reported ''trouble obtaining a sample'' (data not shown).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Clinician acceptability survey", "text": "Of the 238 clinicians invited to participate, 118 (49.6%) consented and responded to the survey. Response rates were highest among gynecologists (64.7%) and were somewhat lower in family practitioners (41.6%) and physician assistants (14.3%). Respondents were mainly women (82.9%) and were 70.9% were internists or family practitioners (Table 4). Approximately half of respondents (47.5%) had been in practice <10 years. Approximately one-third reported performing Pap screening on a daily basis, and 64.1% of respondents reported prior knowledge of the HOPE study.    5 summarizes the characteristics of a screening test that were identified as important by clinicians. A higher percentage of clinicians indicated that patient acceptability was important (93.2%) compared to clinician acceptability (72.9%). The majority (78.0%) reported that they would recommend a self-collected HPV test if the test had qualities such as a high sensitivity and cost effectiveness. The most common reason cited for not recommending a self-collected HPV test was concern that a missed clinic visit could translate into a missed opportunity to address other health issues (n = 28). Other concerns included patient nonadherence to clinic-based follow-up, patients not coming in to the clinic for preventative exams, concerns about difficulty with sample collection or processing, and a desire to discuss the test results with a patient in clinic. Additional chi-square test for trend analyses comparing responses by age and years of practice (data not shown) revealed that older clinicians >40 years ( p = 0.06) and those in practice longer >10 years ( p = 0.03) were somewhat more likely to list ''patient able to obtain adequate sample'' as an important characteristic for the screening test. Most survey respondents reported prior knowledge of the HOPE study, and survey responses for those with and without prior knowledge of the HOPE study were similar.\nWhen subdivided by specialty, gynecologists were significantly less likely to recommend self-collected HPV testing ( p = 0.03). A ''missed opportunity to address other health concerns'' was the most common reason provided by gynecologists for not recommending a self-collected screening test (12 [67%] of 18 respondents). Ten percent of providers suggested additional characteristics that would be important for the self-collected test including: patient ability to understand results, ease of access to sample materials and testing, compliance with sample return, established frequency for testing, appropriate reminder systems in place, insurance coverage, stability of samples at room temperature, turnaround time, and positive and negative predictive values.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Although a number of studies have shown that self-collected HPV tests are acceptable to patients, to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to also determine acceptability in clinicians. Our results suggest that self-collected HPV testing would be acceptable to clinicians if specific characteristics for a screening test could be met. However, this study also highlights clinician fears regarding missed opportunities to detect other health issues due to lack of a clinic visit. Limitations of this clinician survey include a small sample size, a 50% response rate that varied somewhat by specialty, and a study population of mostly nongynecologic academic clinicians who may be more willing to adopt new approaches to cervical cancer screening than those outside of an academic setting. More than one-third of clinician respondents had <5 years in practice (44 in total: 34 residents, 3 fellows and 7 faculties). As such, it is important to confirm these results in a larger, more diverse group of clinicians, including those in primary care as well as gynecologic specialties, to determine whether selfcollected HPV tests are similarly viewed. Missing information is as follows: sex (n = 1), degree (n = 2), specialty (n = 1), frequency of Pap testing (n = 1). a Frequencies reported for all participants who responded to this question regardless of whether or not they reported that they would recommend home HPV testing.\nFindings from this study are consistent with others that show that self-sampling is generally acceptable to patients. 5,13,14 Over half the women in the clinician-obtained Pap arm of the study, and over 63% of women in the selfcollection arm of the study indicated they would prefer the option of self-collected testing; however, all participants were aware the study was evaluating a self-collected HPV screening test at recruitment, which may have resulted in overestimation of acceptability. Other limitations include the fact that this was a convenience sample, and that most (85%) participants were enrolled from a research clinic or at an academic institution. Despite this, our study population was similar to the general Seattle population in terms of race, ethnicity, and educational attainment. However, the views and preferences or participants in this study may not be generalizable to a specific population (United States Census Estimates July 1, 2015, www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/ RHI105210/5363000).\nSince women who preferred self-collected HPV testing cited convenience and less embarrassment or discomfort as reasons for their preference, this supports the idea that selfcollected samples could be an important alternative for women who may be reluctant to present to a clinic for routine screening. 7,13,15,16 In a rural community in Ontario, Canada, under-screened women were twice as likely to participate in cervical cancer screening when offered self-collected HPV sampling kits compared to women who were invited to undergo Pap testing. 14 In Argentina, offering self-collection of samples for HPV testing by community health workers during home visits resulted in a fourfold increase in cervical cancer screening uptake. 7 Positive self-collected HPV test results may be helpful in encouraging women to then present to a clinic for further testing. For instance, among a group of underserved women in rural Appalachia, women more frequently returned for follow-up Pap test if their self-collected HPV test results were positive. 9 Special populations such as lesbian/bisexual women and under-screened Swiss women (no Pap within 3 years) have been reported to have similar acceptance of selfcollected testing. [17][18][19] An important consideration is the age at which a selfcollected HPV test can be offered if deemed suitable for use. In this study, most clinicians (73.2%) felt the self-collected HPV test would be acceptable for use at all ages. In the HOPE study protocol, all participants aged 21-65 years were randomized to a self-collected HPV test or clinicbased Pap. Given most clinician respondents reported some prior knowledge or experience with the HOPE study, this may have biased their response. Since current guidelines 3,12 do not recommend the use of HPV testing for women aged <25 years, evaluation of whether the self-collected HPV test has similar accuracy and cost effectiveness in young women aged <25 years compared to women aged 25 years or older will need to be performed before self-collected HPV can be recommended for use across a wider age range.\nMost women in the HOPE study reported that they would be more comfortable with a self-collected HPV test if a provider recommends this form of screening, if a clinic confirmed that the test was performed correctly, and if the provider contacted the patient to discuss the results, including any need for followup. Anhang studied a population of low-income, Hispanic uninsured women who indicated a preference for clinician col-lected samples (68%) over self-collect because they had more faith in the results; however, 21% of subjects indicated that selfcollection would increase their likelihood of participation in screening. 13 Similarly, in Victoria, Australia, women perceived self-sampling to be more convenient and less embarrassing and uncomfortable, but expressed concern that self-sampling would be less accurate than a clinician-collected Pap test. 16 In our study, preference for self-collected HPV testing increased with education attainment and household income. Similar to our findings, in rural El Salvador, self-collection preference was associated with increased education and prior knowledge of HPV. 20 Further, a study of self-collected HPV tests in 3,863 women from India, Nicaragua and Uganda showed that acceptability was increased when providers prepared women for testing with education. 21 Finally, a consistent finding between clinicians and patients was the need to ensure that patients had access to their healthcare provider to address other concerns. Integration of self-collected HPV tests into routine clinical practice, should they prove accurate and cost effective, will not only require education but also determining how to establish new clinical pathways for recommending and following up test results while ensuring continued access to a healthcare provider for other needs.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Home self-collected HPV screening tests are acceptable to patients and clinicians if the test is shown to be accurate, cost effective, and does not impact access to a healthcare provider for other health concerns.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Supported by National Institutes of Health NIH R01 R01-CA-15469.

[1][2][3][4] Oxidative stress can be broadly defined as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants, potentially leading to damage. 5,6 If the level of reactive species is high and overcomes the antioxidant defense mechanisms of the human body, oxidative damage can occur to lipids, proteins, or directly to DNA. 7 DNA damage is hypothesized to play an important role in the initiation of carcinogenesis.\nOxidative stress mechanisms are also involved in the activation of cell signaling pathways, including tumor cell proliferation, increased tumor cell migration, and increased tumor cell proangiogenic factors, and play a key role in apoptosis, mechanisms that can impact both cancer progression and me-tastasis. 2,[8][9][10] Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resulting high oxidative stress are key characteristics of malignant tumors. 11 Many cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy and certain chemotherapy agents, act through oxidative stress pathways via the production of ROS to kill tumor cells. [12][13][14] Several biomarkers of oxidative stress have been identified for use in epidemiologic studies and can be measured in various biological samples, including both blood and urine. 7,[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] Commonly used biomarkers include DNA damage biomarkers, such as 8-hydroxy-2\u00a2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 22 protein carbonyl groups as a marker of protein oxidation, 23 and malondialdehyde (MDA) and F2isoprostanes as markers of lipid peroxidation. 21,[24][25][26][27] Studies have also evaluated the role of oxidative stress in cancer and other chronic diseases using plasma fluorescent oxidation products (FlOPs), which are considered a global biomarker of oxidative stress. 20,28 Biomarkers of oxidative stress have been investigated for their association with the development and progression of 1 Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Nashville, Tennessee. 2 Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee.\nseveral cancer types, and in particular breast cancer, as oxidative stress mechanisms may be involved in several known breast cancer risk factors, including obesity and daily alcohol intake, and circulating estrogen levels.

The first systematic search was to identify studies of oxidative stress biomarkers and risk of developing breast cancer and the second was for studies of oxidative stress biomarkers and breast cancer prognosis.

A total of 12 case-control studies, including five nested case-control studies, were identified. Oxidative stress biomarkers varied across studies, with measures of damage/oxidation to lipids, DNA, and protein, as well as a global biomarker of oxidative stress, FlOP levels.\nCase-control studies with biomarkers measured after diagnosis. In a population-based case-control study of 400 cases and 401 controls from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project, a positive association was reported for urinary 15-F 2t -IsoP measured via immunoassay and risk of breast cancer, but not urinary 8-oxodG measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 40 All samples for the cases were collected within on average 3 months after diagnosis of breast cancer, with most before the initiation of chemotherapy. The positive association between 15-F 2t -IsoP and increased risk of breast cancer was found among both pre-and postmenopausal women. Subsequently, investigators from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project conducted a larger study with 1061 breast cancer cases and 1108 controls (including the original cases/controls from the first study) and found no statistically significant associations between 15-F 2t -IsoP or 8-oxodG and breast cancer. 41 In a separate report, investigators from this same study evaluated the association between plasma protein carbonyl levels and breast cancer among 1050 cases and 1107 controls. 31 They reported a trend for increasing odds of breast cancer risk in relation to increasing quartiles of plasma protein carbonyl levels measured via noncompetitive ELISA. The association was not modified by menopausal status.\nIn a population-based case-control study of 268 sister sets from the Breast Cancer Family Registry, where one sister was a case and the other was a control, plasma protein carbonyls measured via noncompetitive ELISA were associated with increased odds of breast cancer, adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors. All samples were taken months to years after diagnosis for the cases. 42 A small case-control study with 57 cases and 139 controls conducted in Malaysia reported that higher levels of plasma MDA were associated with increased odds of breast cancer, adjusting for type of education, type of occupation, relatives, lactation, and waist circumference. 43 A very small case-control study among 70 cases and 70 controls reported that higher DNA damage in lymphocytes measured via the comet assay was associated with increased odds of breast cancer. 44 None of these three small studies evaluated associations by menopausal status.    factors. 45 However, when stratified by menopausal status, an inverse association was observed for both biomarkers among premenopausal women only (e.g., 15-F 2t -IsoP in the highest tertile [reference was the lowest] was associated with 42% reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer).\nIn a second nested case-control study in the same cohort with a smaller sample size (354 breast cancer cases/654 controls), breast cancer was not associated with urinary levels of MDA or 8-oxodG, 46 with authors reporting that associations were not modified by menopausal status. A nested casecontrol study in the Nurses' Health Study of 377 cases/377 controls evaluated the associations of FlOPs and breast cancer risk. Biomarkers were classified as proximate exposure (\u00a36 years before diagnosis) and distant exposure ( \u202110 years before diagnosis). 28 For FlOP_360, proximate levels for the second quartile (207-251 FI/mL) only (RRs [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.4-0.9]) were inversely associated with breast cancer risk, associations were not observed for the second or third quartile, and associations for this biomarker measured distantly were null. For FlOP_320 and FlOP_400, no clear pattern of association with breast cancer overall was observed.\nA fourth prospective nested case-control study of 336 cases/ 336 controls in Denmark evaluated urinary 8-oxodG levels measured via column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography in association with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Samples from cases were collected at cohort entry within 5 years of diagnosis. Overall, a positive association between 8-oxodG and risk of breast cancer was observed, 30 and when stratified by ER status, the positive association was limited to women with ER+ breast cancer. In 2015, a large nested casecontrol study focusing on premenopausal breast cancer in the Nurses' Health Study I and II studies reported some evidence for an inverse association for FlOPs and premenopausal breast cancer (e.g., FlOP_360 highest quartile levels [compared with lowest quartile levels] were associated with a 32% decreased risk of premenopausal breast cancer in adjusted models). 47 Subgroup analyses for lifestyle factors. Lifestyle factors may be associated with oxidative damage, and several studies considered body-mass index (BMI) and other lifestyle factors as potential effect modifiers/interaction variables, with results summarized (if available) in the comments section of Table 2. Briefly, three studies reported that results differed by BMI. In an early small case-control study, Smith et al. reported that the association between DNA damage and breast cancer was stronger among women with higher BMI, although no statistical test for interaction was provided. 44 Dai et al. reported a positive association for 15-F 2t -IsoPM among women with higher BMI and inverse association among women with lower BMI. 45 In the Nurses' Health Study, one of the FlOP biomarkers was found to have a significant positive association only among women with low BMI; however, the p-value for interaction was not statistically significant (0.13). 28 One study reported that the positive association of 8-oxodG was only present in women with low dietary iron intake; p-value for interaction = 0.02. 30 ", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Oxidative stress biomarkers and breast cancer prognosis", "text": "Study design and study population details are displayed in Table 3 and results are summarized in Table 4. We identified a total of eight studies that investigated biomarkers of oxidative stress in association with breast cancer prognosis with various oxidative stress biomarkers in blood, urine, and tissue utilized. The largest and earliest study identified, a prospective cohort of 363 breast cancer patients, reported that lipoperoxides measured in plasma before surgery were statistically significantly associated with increased risk of recurrence (>0.5 lmol/L = 2.13 [1.13-4.01]). However, lipoperoxides were not significantly associated with breast cancer-specific mortality (>0.5 lmol/L = 1.60 [0.73-3.51]). 48 In 2010, Sova et al. reported that negative 8-oxodG tumor status based on immunohistochemistry was associated with lower breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). 49 This study also reported that serum 8-oxodG, from blood collected before surgery, was not associated with BCSS, but data were not shown. Two small Finnish cohort studies evaluated 8-oxodG tumor status in association with BCSS, with the first evaluating 8-oxodG alone 50 and the second evaluating 8-oxodG in combination with 8-oxoguanine glycosylase. 51 The authors reported that no statistically significant associations were observed in multivariable analyses (effect estimates were not reported; Table 4).\nVera-Ramirez et al. conducted two studies, the first among 70 breast cancer patients 52 and the second among 30 metastatic only patients. 53 In both studies, they investigated biomarkers of DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein damage in association with disease-free survival and overall survival both before and after chemotherapy and found no evidence for an association between any of the studied biomarkers and prognosis. In a small nested case-control study of 160 breast cancer cases from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, GC/ NICI MS was used to measure 15-F 2t -IsoP and 15-F 2t -IsoPM in urine samples collected after completion of cancer treatment. 54 Adjusting for clinical and lifestyle factors, higher urinary levels of 15-F 2t -IsoP were statistically significantly inversely associated with total mortality, while levels of 15-F 2t -IsoPM were not significantly associated with survival.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Biomarkers of oxidative stress and risk of developing breast cancer", "text": "Associations between oxidative stress biomarkers and breast cancer risk were inconsistent across studies, with evidence for both positive and inverse associations depending on the biomarkers evaluated and/or menopausal status. Three studies evaluated 8-oxodG, a valid marker of DNA damage, with two case-control studies reporting null results and one prospective cohort study reporting increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in association with higher levels of DNA damage. Two prospective cohort studies with measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers before breast cancer diagnosis reported inverse associations with breast cancer risk among premenopausal women only. Two case-control studies reported increased risk of breast cancer in association with protein oxidation measured after breast cancer diagnosis.\nWhile some studies measured two oxidative stress biomarkers; none evaluated markers of DNA, lipid, and protein damage together and only one study measured biomarkers at more than one time point. Beyond menopausal status, results from subgroups analyses defined by BMI, dietary factors, and/or ER status suggested potential effect modification of the associations of oxidative stress and breast cancer risk by BMI and ER status in particular, which may contribute to differences across studies. Some studies have reported that higher levels of oxidative stress are associated with obesity and adipose tissue. 37,[55][56][57] The finding of higher levels of oxidative stress and increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer could reflect the known obesity and postmenopausal breast cancer association. 58 In fact, Dai et al. conducted analyses stratified by BMI and found a positive association among women with higher BMI, but not among women with lower BMI. 45 One key limitation that may contribute to the inconsistent results observed across studies is the timing of sample collection. Several studies collected samples after diagnosis of breast cancer, with some after surgery and/or during cancer treatment (such as chemotherapy). Levels of oxidative stress may change based on the presence and progression of the tumor itself and due to cancer treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. 9,13 While nested  case-control studies can help minimize this limitation, the concern that oxidative stress may be generated by the preclinical tumor remains. 32 This potential bias can be evaluated by stratifying associations by length of follow-up time, which was rarely done in the identified reports.\nAnother limitation is that breast cancer has been shown to be an etiologically heterogeneous disease, with studies showing modification of known associations by tumor subtype. 58,59 However, to date, only two studies examined associations of biomarkers of oxidative stress with breast cancer risk by tumor ER status, 30,47 and no studies have evaluated associations by molecular subtypes. Finally, differences in how menopausal status was defined across studies, a known methodological limitation in epidemiological studies considering menopausal status, 60 or lack of stratifying results by menopausal status could have contributed to inconsistencies in findings.\nMany reviews have described the limitations and strengths of various noninvasive biomarkers of oxidative stress used in epidemiological studies, including measurement issues (e.g., see Refs. 7,[15][16][17][18][19]21,24,61 ). Herein, we highlight some key issues to demonstrate how measurement assays and type of biomarker can also contribute to inconsistencies and lack of replication of findings. MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, was used in several studies summarized in this review, but is known to have the key issue of nonspecificity.\nThe gold standard in lipid peroxidation measurement includes 15-F 2t -IsoP and 15-F 2t -IsoPM, valid biomarkers of systematic in vivo oxidative stress. Highly sensitive and specific assays have been developed to measure F 2isoprostanes using GC/NICI MS. 62 In our review, some studies used GC/NICI MS and others used immunoassays to measure F 2 -isoprostanes, which are less accurate. 26,62 8-OxodG is one of the most commonly used markers for assessing oxidative DNA damage as it is one of the most abundant DNA lesions caused by ROS. However, 8-oxodG is a function not only of oxidation of DNA but also of excision repair, 51 and studies that measure both DNA repair and oxidative DNA damage are needed to improve interpretation of findings. In summary, inconsistent results may be attributed to using unreliable assays and markers for the detection of systematic oxidative stress, lack of assaying biomarkers at more than one time point before diagnosis, and lack of careful consideration of the impact of preclinical cancer on oxidative stress biomarkers.", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Biomarkers of oxidative stress and breast cancer prognosis", "text": "Oxidative stress plays a critical role in cancer treatment, with cytotoxic therapies increasing oxidative damage to potentially kill tumor cells. Beyond cancer treatment, oxidative stress from endogenous (e.g., metabolism, immune response) and exogenous sources (e.g., ionizing radiation, smoking, chemicals) may result in changes in the metabolic pathways in tumor cells, tumor vascular networks, and tumor macrophage infiltration. 8,33 These alterations can impact not only tumor progression but also cancer cell adaption to oxidative stress, potentially leading to increased resistance to therapy, angiogenesis, and increased risk of metastasis. 8,9 Due to the critical role of oxidative stress mechanisms in both cancer treatment and potentially cancer metastasis, it has been suggested that oxidative stress may be particularly important in cancer prognosis; however, as we found in this review, the epidemiologic literature in this area is very limited to date.\nOverall, studies of oxidative stress biomarkers and breast cancer prognosis have been limited by small sample sizes (ranged from 30 to 363 cases) and/or lack of standardized analytic approaches (e.g., multivariable survival analyses) with consideration of key covariates/potential confounding factors. In addition, most were single-hospital studies and not a This study only reported results that included both an oxidative stress biomarker and DNA repair biomarker combined, which is why the DNA repair biomarker is included in the study description.\nDFS, disease-free survival; ER, estrogen receptor; HER-2, human epidermal growth factor receptor; hOGG1, human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase; IHC, immunohistochemistry; PR, progesterone receptor; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances.\npopulation-based studies. Various biomarkers were used, with some studies measuring DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and/or protein damage in various biological samples (blood, tissue, urine). Furthermore, the timing of biomarkers varied, with some studies measuring markers before surgery, after surgery and before/during chemotherapy, and after any cancer treatments. The largest and earliest study reported a positive association between a marker of lipid damage and prognosis 48 ; however, this study used a marker of lipid peroxidation known to be nonspecific. Other studies generally reported limited evidence for an association. In summary, the lack of sufficient statistical power, use of various biomarkers, variation in time at biomarker assessments, and inadequate adjustment for confounding factors across studies hinder our ability to make a clear conclusion regarding the role of the biomarkers of oxidative stress in breast cancer prognosis at this time.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Research needs summary and conclusions", "text": "A key limitation of the literature to date is lack of studies in minority populations, including African American and Hispanic women, who may have different risk factor profiles for breast cancer and altered levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. 63 Another key limitation is that no studies evaluated associations by breast cancer molecular subtype, which could be particularly informative for understanding mechanisms of oxidative stress both in the etiology and prognosis of breast cancer. Studies were further limited as most did not evaluate multiple valid biomarkers in multiple biological samples (e.g., urine and blood or blood and tumor tissue), which could help overcome limitations found in using a single biomarker. Finally, there were insufficient data to conduct a metaanalysis at this time; however, this may be possible after future research.\nIn conclusion, prospective studies provide inconsistent evidence that oxidative stress may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (specifically DNA damage), but may be inversely associated with risk of premenopausal breast cancer (specifically F 2 -ispoprostanes and FlOPs). This association may be modified by ER status and/or BMI, but future studies with a larger sample size, applying standardized and multiple markers for measuring oxidative damage in prediagnostic biological samples, are needed to confirm these findings. Lipid peroxidation may play a role in breast cancer prognosis based on two small studies to date. Future large prospective studies that include multiple sample types (tissue, urine) using valid biomarkers measured at multiple time points after diagnosis (before and after cancer treatments) may be particularly informative and help to overcome methodological limitations of previous prognostic studies.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments and Funding", "text": "The authors thank Min Gao for helping with data abstraction.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional, baseline data from an intervention that was conducted between August 2008 and March 2009 in five family planning clinics in the San Francisco, California area, to examine the association of race/ethnicity with RC, IPV, and UIP among female patients aged 16-29 (n = 1234). Results: RC was significantly associated with race/ethnicity, p < 0.001, [prevalence estimates: Black (37.1%), multiracial (29.2%), White (18.0%), Hispanic/Latina (24.0%), and Asian/Pacific Islander/other (API/other) (18.4%)]. Race/ethnicity was not associated with IPV. UIP was more prevalent among Black (50.3%) and multiracial (47.2%) women, with an overall range of 37.1%-50.3% among all racial/ethnic groups ( p < 0.001). In adjusted analyses, factors associated with UIP were RC [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.59, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.26-2.01] and Black (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.02-2.60) and API/other (AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.15-1.73) race/ethnicity, which remained significant in the presence of RC. Race-stratified models revealed that RC increased odds of UIP for White (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.45-2.93) and Black women (AOR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.14-2.60). Conclusions: Black and multiracial women seeking care in family planning clinics have a disproportionately high prevalence of RC and UIP. RC may partially explain differences in UIP prevalence, with the effect of race/ ethnicity slightly attenuated in RC-adjusted models. However, the impact of RC on risk for UIP was similar for White and Black women. Findings from this study support the need to understand and prevent RC, particularly among women of color. Results are foundational in understanding disparities in RC and UIP that may have implications for refinement of clinical care.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A pproximately 45% of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. 1 Unintended pregnancies (UIP) influence maternal and child health [1][2][3] and are associated with lack or delay of prenatal care, maternal anxiety and depression, poor birth outcomes, and negative impacts on child development. 3 These effects are amplified among young mothers. 4 Nationally, UIP is the most prevalent among Black (64%) and Hispanic/Latina (50%) women, 1,5,6 yet the reasons underlying this racial/ethnic disparity remain elusive. 4 Racial/ethnic disparities in UIP persist, despite an overall reduction in UIPs in recent years and improvements in women's health policies that increase access to contraception. 1,4,[6][7][8][9][10][11] The socio-ecological model is a useful framework to understand the multifactorial nature of UIP risk factors at the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels that may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in intimate partner violence (IPV).\nAt the individual level, contraception use/adherence, age, and past sexual experiences influence the risk of UIP. 12,13 Specifically, in a nationally representative sample, Black and Hispanic/Latina women were relatively more likely to report early onset of sexual intercourse (before age 13), having more than four sexual partners in their lifetime, and failure to use contraception during their previous sexual encounter. 14 These differences may be impacted by varying attitudes and practices regarding sexuality and family planning based on cultural norms shaped by and reinforced within families and communities. [15][16][17] For instance, Rocca et al. 18 reported significant differences in the perception of childbearing between racial/ethnic groups, with childbearing being perceived as more favorable among Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women and unfavorable among White women relative to Black women. 18 Also, pregnancy intention and types of contraception used have been reported to vary between racial/ethnic groups and based on level of education and income. 15,19,20 At the societal level, women who experience moderate to high levels of social discrimination are more likely to have a UIP. 21 Racial discrimination is significantly associated with an increase in risk-taking, 22 including risky sexual behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, transactional sex, and concurrent sex partners). 23 Additional socio-structural predictors of UIP include country of origin, access to care, educational attainment, and social standing. 16 Kim et al. 9 conducted a decomposition analysis using the National Survey of Family Growth and found that characteristics including age, relationship status, insurance type, and education explained 51% of the differences in UIP among Black and White women and 73% of the differences in UIP among Hispanic and White women. These findings suggest that a large percentage of racial/ethnic disparity in UIP is unexplained and potential race-based mechanisms that underlie UIP have yet to be clearly defined. Although several studies have reported risk factors for UIP among the socioecological strata, one important gap is our understanding of the impact of interpersonal risk factors for UIP, namely, the influence of male partners in the context of race/ethnicity.\nIPV has long been associated with risk for UIP. 24,25 In addition, emerging research has identified the role of behaviors of male partners in increasing women's odds of UIP. [26][27][28] Reproductive coercion (RC) is one such mecha-nism linking violence within intimate relationships and UIP. RC is a phenomenon that involves pregnancy coercion (e.g., using threats to promote a pregnancy) and active manipulation of condoms and hormonal contraception to promote a pregnancy (e.g., breaking condoms on purpose, flushing birth control pills down the toilet). 29,30 RC can occur both in the context of IPV and in relationships where physical or sexual IPV is absent. A study of predominately White women aged 16-29 years old at 24 family planning clinics in Western Pennsylvania found that those who reported recent (past 3 months) experiences of RC and IPV were twice as likely to report a UIP compared with those without RC or IPV exposure. Odds of UIP were also elevated among women who reported only RC or IPV (but not both). 31 In a separate study using the same sample, Jones et al. 28 found that condom negotiation self-efficacy mediated the relationship between RC and past-year UIP among the young adult population (ages 20-24 years). In another study of women aged 18 or older, married or cohabitating Latina and Asian women, only those who experienced IPV, were twice as likely to experience a UIP relative to women who were not exposed to IPV. 32 Despite emerging work on the impact of RC on UIP, studies to date have not assessed the combined impact of race/ethnicity and RC/IPV on risk for UIP.\nThe current study, which addresses the aforementioned gap, focuses on the interpersonal level of the socio-ecological framework and recognizes the complex influences across multiple levels that contribute to risk of UIP. 33 This study examines associations among RC, IPV, and UIP by selfreported race/ethnicity among a sample of young women. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative presentation of differences in RC and its contribution to UIP by race/ ethnicity. This article examines (1) the prevalence of RC, IPV, and UIP with regard to race/ethnicity; (2) the effect of race/ethnicity, RC, and IPV as coexperiences on risk for UIP; (3) and the race-specific effects of RC on UIP risk.", "n_publication_ref": 46, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sample", "text": "Data were drawn from the baseline survey of a longitudinal cluster-randomized trial of a clinical intervention to address RC/IPV and reduce UIP. 26 Participants were English-or Spanish-speaking women aged 16-29 years seeking services at five freestanding family planning clinics located in lowincome neighborhoods in the San Francisco, California area.

We used a series of logistic regression models to assess the effects of race/ethnicity on the risk of UIP, with adjustments for age, education, relationship status, and country of origin. Subsequently, we added RC, and the final model included both RC and IPV (Table 3). Finally, we tested the race-specific effects of RC on the risk of UIP by race/ethnicity, comparing women with exposure to RC to non-exposed women in models stratified by race/ ethnicity (Table 4).

No race-specific RC effects on UIP were found for Hispanic/Latina, multiracial, or API/other women.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first quantitative study to document that Black (37.1%) and multiracial (29.0%) women disproportionately experience RC by male partners. Although previous studies 26,31 have illustrated that women who experience RC are more likely to report UIPs, current findings suggest that this may be the case primarily for White and Black women. We found that the relative increase in odds of UIP given RC was similar for White and Black women, suggesting several potential scenarios: (1) RC may be driving the disparities in UIP among Black and White women, given the higher prevalence of RC and UIP reported by Black women; and\n(2) RC is likely only one driver of disparities in UIP seen by race/ethnicity, as we hypothesized that the odds of UIP given RC would be elevated among Black women compared with White women.\nIn addition to findings among Black and White women, multiracial women were nearly twice as likely as White women to experience RC. Although this exposure did not translate into a statistically significant increased risk of UIP in race-specific models, the overall sample size within this category was relatively small, which may have compromised statistical power. Elevated, though non-significant, odds of RC among multiracial women warrant further investigation to understand experiences of abuse among women of color and how they impact their reproductive health. A study by Jackson et al. 38 reports a difference in contraception preference based on race/ethnicity, with Black, Hispanic, and API women favoring features of contraceptive methods that happen to have lower efficacy and may allow for greater susceptibility to partner manipulation or refusal of contraception (i.e., RC). These features included a contraceptive method that they had the ability to stop at any time, was only needed during intercourse, provided protection against sexually transmitted infections, and did not interfere with their menstruation cycle. 38 In addition to partner influence on UIP through contraception manipulation or refusal, marital status is associated with increased risk of UIP in certain minority populations. Namely, Masho et al. 39 reported that married White, Hispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian women who experienced IPV had significantly greater odds of a UIP relative to women who were not exposed to IPV-this association was the most pronounced among Hawaiian women, who were nearly five times the odds of experiencing a UIP due to exposure to IPV. 39 These findings may help to explain the persisting and elevated odds of UIP among API/other women in the present study, particularly after the addition of IPV into the model. IPV attenuated the risk of UIP among Black women, yet the significant risk for UIP based on exposure to RC and IPV persisted among API/other women. In this study, we lacked sufficient numbers of Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and other women for race/ethnicity-specific analyses, thus combining them into one group. Future studies should focus on differences within these sub-groups to fully understand factors that drive risk for UIP. Overall, the racial/ethnic differences documented in this study call for deeper exploration of how RC, IPV, and UIP are defined within various cultural contexts as well as possible drivers of health inequalities related to RC, IPV, and UIP.\nThe theoretical framework that guides this study acknowledges that health disparities are often linked to racial/ ethnic experiences, for instance discrimination and segregation, which impact social and sexual networks, limit access to resources, and contribute to chronic stress. 21,40,41 In this study, self-reported race/ethnicity was a proxy for race/ethnicbased experiences. 42 The association between race/ethnicity and health is often entangled in socioeconomic status (SES), 43 which is not surprising given the racialization of social class. 44 In a study by Finer and Henshaw, 10 race/ethnicity was documented as a predictor of UIP, despite income level. In an exploration of social standing, an increase in social standing among Black women was not directly related with decreased UIP risk, despite decreases in UIPs among White women of increased social standing. 12,16 Thus, factors beyond SES such as incarceration, perceived discrimination, and social stress may contribute to women's risk for UIP. In this study, the sample of women reflects a generally lower income population; therefore, the racial/ethnic differences observed are likely due to factors beyond SES. Additional studies are needed to explore the drivers of UIP among racial/ethnic minorities and risk factors for RC and UIP.\nA benefit of the present study is that women were all seeking care in family planning clinics. Although access to care is so often an important driver of health disparities, 45 that is not the case in this clinic-based study. Participants in this study sought care at family planning clinics known for providing affordable care to both insured and uninsured individuals. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive reproductive and sexual healthcare that recognizes the links between violence and women's health. A recent study by Phillips et al. 46 reported that women who experience RC are more than twice as likely to participate in risky sexual behaviors such as transactional sex when compared with women who have not experienced RC. Miller et al. 47 demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief clinical intervention in reducing odds of RC, particularly pregnancy coercion, among women who reported recent experiences of IPV. However, scaling-up of this intervention did not yield a statistically significant reduction in overall RC, with RC reductions noted only among women who experienced more severe RC at baseline. 48 A greater understanding of socioecological determinants of health is needed to inform health interventions and practices that reduce UIP and associated health concerns such as RC and IPV. The racial/ethnic differences documented in this study call for deeper exploration of potential drivers of health inequalities related to RC, IPV, and UIP and consideration of how these factors may be incorporated into existing interventions.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "This study is not without limitations. The cross-sectional study design only allows for assessment of associations among lifetime experiences of RC, IPV, and UIP; we were not able to establish temporality. A longitudinal study would bolster our understanding of the associations found. Aside from their known association with experiencing RC, IPV, and UIP, this design did not control directly for potentially confounding variables such as partner characteristics, risky sexual practices, and contraception nonuse not influenced by an intimate partner. [49][50][51] Also, the restricted sample, inclusive of women seeking clinical services, may not be generalizable to the general population in other regions of the country.

Future studies should consider the influence of socio-structural factors (i.e., discrimination, stress, relationships, poverty, incarceration, and perceptions of upward mobility) as potential drivers of RC and UIP, as well as their impact on associated health concerns such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

Patients and Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from August 6, 2012, through November 14, 2012. Respondents aged 18-49 years who reported a physician's diagnosis/suspicion of endometriosis within the previous 10 years were included. Endometriosis-related symptoms and diagnostic history were captured and summarized. Univariate analyses identified factors associated with time from symptom onset to first consultation and from first consultation to diagnosis. Results: Of 638 respondents included, most (56%) reported seeking care for at least one of the following symptoms: menstrual pain (31.6%), nonmenstrual pain (27.3%), and pain during sex (7.5%). Most diagnoses (84%) were made by obstetricians/gynecologists; 49% of diagnoses were surgical versus 51% nonsurgical. Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4.4 years. Mean time to first consultation was shorter among women aged 40-49 years versus those aged <18 years (14.2 vs. 43.5 months; p < 0.0001) and those consulting for symptoms versus routine/other care (27.9, 24.9, and 28.4 months for menstrual pain, nonmenstrual pain, and pain during sex, respectively, vs. 61.4 months; all p < 0.01).

[2][3][4] In addition, findings on clinical examination are often normal in women with endometriosis. 5 Definitive diagnosis in the absence of visible lesions has been most commonly established through pelvic laparoscopy, with histological confirmation. 5 For these and other reasons, there can be a substantial delay from symptom onset to diagnosis in many patients.\nGlobally, the delay in diagnosing women afflicted with endometriosis is currently estimated at *5-10 years. [6][7][8][9][10] In the United States (US), the average length of time to establish an endometriosis diagnosis was estimated at *12 years based on a survey conducted in 1995 2 and at *9 years based on analyses of the 1998 Endometriosis Association Survey. 11,12 These estimates indicate that time to diagnosis is quite long and one of the goals of this study was to determine if this lengthy delay still exists today. Because endometriosis is associated with decreased health-related quality of life, increased healthcare resource utilization, and loss of work productivity, 6,8,[13][14][15] longer delay in diagnosis may lead to unnecessarily prolonged patient suffering and to greater socioeconomic cost.\nTo accelerate diagnosis, a number of investigators have begun to characterize the factors that contribute to lengthy delay. For example, Greene et al. 12 showed that US patients who were adolescents at symptom onset took 3 times longer to receive a diagnosis versus those with adult onset; they also showed that patients who sought care from a generalist experienced a 30% longer delay in receiving a diagnosis versus those who saw a gynecologist. 12 Other factors, including key symptoms that lead women to seek medical attention, remain less well studied.\nGuidelines for the diagnosis and management of endometriosis have begun to emphasize the role of noninvasive methods, including advanced imaging techniques, 5,16 but the impact of this shift in diagnostic algorithm on time to diagnosis has not been assessed. Understanding the factors contributing to delays in diagnosis may lead to changes in current clinical practice patterns, patient awareness/education and identify key areas for further improvement.\nThe objectives of the current study were (1) to assess the duration of time to a diagnosis of endometriosis among patients in the US from 2002 to 2012 and (2) to identify key patient-and physician-related factors that affected the duration of time to diagnosis during that period. Patient-related factors assessed included sociodemographic characteristics, endometriosis-related symptom experience, and diagnostic experience; physician-related factors included clinical specialty and diagnostic methods employed. Overall diagnostic delay was defined as time from symptom onset to the diagnosis of endometriosis. To better differentiate patientdependent factors from physician-related factors, we considered the contributions to overall delay from two separate intervals: the time from symptom onset to first consultation with a medical practitioner and the time from first consultation until diagnosis.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Patients and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "Details on study design and survey content were described in previous reports. 17,18 We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of US resident women aged 18-54 years from August 6, 2012, through September 14, 2012. The survey was designed by the investigators and administered through Harris Interactive, Inc. (New York, NY), using previously described methodology.

To protect subject confidentiality, the survey was conducted using secure servers, and data were deidentified before analysis.\nFor the current study, survey participants were recruited primarily from three actively managed market research panels: Harris Poll Online (Harris Interactive, Inc., NY, NY), Global Market Insights (Lightspeed Research, Warren, NJ), and e-Rewards Opinion Panel (Research Now Group, Inc., Plano, TX). A subset of respondents was recruited from a specifically targeted sample of women who had indicated being diagnosed with endometriosis and/or uterine fibroids (UF) during previous research. 17,18 Data analyses of this survey that focused on examining the prevalence and symptomatic burden of diagnosed endometriosis in comparison with women with no diagnosis of endometriosis were reported previously. 17 The current analysis included those respondents who reported a physician's diagnosis of endometriosis only. Additional inclusion criteria were age 18-49 years at the time of survey administration and history of endometriosis within the past 10 years. The age range was restricted to focus primarily on premenopausal women, and the past 10-year history of endometriosis requirement was imposed to reduce the possibility of recall errors associated with responses to events from the more distant past. 21 ", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Survey contents", "text": "The survey was divided into two main parts: an eligibility screening questionnaire and the main survey of endometriosisrelated outcomes. The screening questionnaire collected information on sociodemographic characteristics (age, race/ ethnicity, geographic region, education, income, and insurance status) and contained items to identify and qualify respondents based on endometriosis-related symptoms and diagnosis.\nSurvey participants were first asked whether they had ever experienced any of the endometriosis-related symptoms listed in Supplementary Box S1 (Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/jwh). They were also asked whether they had ever been told by a physician that they had or were suspected of having endometriosis. Respondents with a diagnosis of endometriosis were then asked about the diagnostic methods employed by their physician, as outlined in Supplementary Box S1.\nThe main survey collected detailed information on each patient's history (pre-and postdiagnosis and within 1 month of completing the survey) regarding symptom severity; medical, treatment, and surgical history; quality of life and health productivity losses related to endometriosis. The main survey also contained several questions used to assess factors potentially affecting the length of time to a diagnosis of endometriosis.\nWe assessed both the time from symptom onset to first physician consultation and the time from first consultation to diagnosis by asking the questions, ''How long after you first noticed your symptoms did you first visit a physician to discuss them?'' and ''How long after you first mentioned your symptoms to a physician were you diagnosed with endometriosis?'' Overall diagnostic delay was defined as the time from symptom onset to diagnosis of endometriosis and was calculated as the sum of the two components. We also assessed overall diagnostic delay independently by asking the questions, ''How long ago did you first experience any endometriosis symptoms?'' and ''How long ago were you first diagnosed with endometriosis?'' Symptoms that led respondents to consult with a physician were assessed by asking, ''What was the primary symptom for which you sought medical help?'' Symptom burden was assessed by asking, ''How would you categorize the overall severity of your endometriosis at the time of diagnosis?'' Responses of mild, moderate, or severe were allowed. Medical history, surgical history, and testing related to endometriosis were assessed with the question, ''Thinking about the time before you were diagnosed with endometriosis, how many times (in total) did you do each of the following to seek symptom relief?'' Potential responses included, visited a doctor, was hospitalized, had a surgical procedure, had a diagnostic procedure (e.g., ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and went to the emergency room.\nDiagnosing physician specialty was ascertained with the question, ''What was the specialty of the physician who formally diagnosed your endometriosis?''

An independent assessment of overall delay from symptom onset to endometriosis diagnosis yielded similar results (mean time to diagnosis = 4.6 years).\nWe also examined the relationship between severity of endometriosis at the time of survey administration and the time from symptom onset to first physician visit. The percentage of women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms was 8.3%, 37.2%, and 54.5%, respectively. For women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, time from symptom onset to first physician visit was 1.7, 2.6, and 2.3 years, respectively; time from first physician visit to diagnosis was 1.2, 2.0, and 2.2 years, respectively; and time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 2.9, 4.6, and 4.5 years, respectively.\nThe most common single symptom (reported by 32% of patients) that led to a consultation was menstrual pain, whereas a majority of respondents (56%) reported seeking medical attention for at least one of three symptoms commonly considered hallmarks of endometriosis-menstrual pain, nonmenstrual pain, and pain during sex. 3,25 These three symptoms were present simultaneously only in *10% of respondents.

As shown in Table 3, younger age at symptom onset was associated with significantly longer diagnostic delay; both time from symptom onset to first consultation and time from first consultation to diagnosis were progressively greater among respondents aged >40, >30, >18, and <18 years, respectively. Time from symptom onset to first consultation was significantly shorter for all age groups compared with the <18-year age group, and time from first consultation to diagnosis was significantly shorter for the 30-to 39-year and 40-to 49-year age groups compared with the <18-year age group ( p < 0.01 each comparison).\nEthnicity.

As shown in Table 4, time from symptom onset to first consultation was significantly shorter among respondents who sought treatment for endometriosisrelated symptoms (except pelvic pressure) compared with those who were diagnosed during routine medical care; mean time from symptom onset to consultation ranged from 14 months for respondents with constipation, bloating, or diarrhea to 28 months for respondents with pain during sex versus 61 months for those in routine care ( p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

In contrast, no significant differences were observed for patients who reported having had a surgical procedure to seek symptom relief and those who did not. No significant associations were observed between diagnostic delay and either emergency department visits or hospitalizations related to endometriosis-related symptoms.\nTime from first consultation to diagnosis of endometriosis was significantly shorter among respondents seen by an OB/ GYN compared with those seen by non-OB/GYNs; mean time from consultation to diagnosis was 21.5 versus 40.3 months ( p = 0.041), respectively.

In the present study, the average time from symptom onset to endometriosis diagnosis among US women was 4.4 years, less than half of the 9-year estimates reported in 1998 11,12 and nearly three times shorter than the 12-year estimate reported in 1996 2 (Supplementary Table S1).\nAverage times from symptom onset to first physician consultation and from first consultation to diagnosis were 2.4 and 2.0 years, respectively, compared with 4.6 and 4.7 years, respectively, reported for 4334 surgically diagnosed women who participated in a 1998 survey conducted by the Endometriosis Association. 12 A shorter time to diagnosis of endometriosis, therefore, appears to be driven both by women seeking medical attention more quickly once they experience symptoms and with faster diagnosis following presentation to a physician. Together, these results suggest that public and physician awareness of endometriosis symptoms and clinical practice methods may have improved over time.\nThe overall time to diagnosis in the US appears similar to or slightly better than recent global estimates of *5-7 years 6-10 (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, our study provides a greater level of detail in terms of symptom burden and diagnostic delay compared with these recent international studies. [6][7][8][9][10] As shown in Supplementary Table S1, we compare our results with several study populations, including tertiary centers, outpatient clinics, endometriosis association members, and online market research providers. Some of these studies examine data from 10 countries and include information on diagnostic delay of endometriosis in women across different cultures and healthcare settings. 6,8 Across the studies summarized in Supplementary Table S1, reported diagnostic delays ranged from 5 to 12 years with shorter delays being reported in more recent years. Research on all of these populations needs to be performed to obtain a complete understanding of the factors contributing to diagnostic delay. To ensure that our survey sample would be representative of the national US population, we used a weighting algorithm with propensity score adjustment to control for attitudinal and behavioral differences between study participants who join online panels and those who do not to reduce selection bias.\nIt is important to note that whereas the majority of previous studies have been restricted to patients with surgically confirmed diagnoses, the current study included women who were diagnosed via surgical and nonsurgical methods. Nonsurgical diagnoses were slightly more common than surgical diagnoses among women in our sample, and those diagnosed via nonsurgical methods tended to have a shorter time to diagnosis.\nAlthough current clinical practice guidelines continue to advocate laparoscopic surgery as the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis, these guidelines also emphasize the importance of flexibility in diagnostic and therapeutic thinking and include limited roles for advanced imaging techniques (transvaginal ultrasound and MRI) in disease assessment as well as trials of empirical treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combined oral contraceptives, and (in some guidelines) gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, in cases of suspected, but unconfirmed, endometriosis. 5,16 Approximately three-fourths of respondents reported receiving diagnostic imaging procedures. However, time from consultation to diagnosis was not affected by the use of imaging. The basis for this result is unclear. Detailed analyses of clinical algorithms employed in endometriosis diagnosis (e.g., the potential use of empirical treatments, the timing of treatments relative to diagnostic imaging, and the identification of physicians most likely to order treatments and/or imaging) were beyond the scope of this analysis.\nOverall, our results appear to be consistent with a shift in clinical practice toward the use of nonsurgical diagnostic methods, including emphasis on symptom presentation, empirical treatments, and/or use of imaging techniques for the diagnosis and management of endometriosis. This shift may be associated with greater quality of life, owing to timelier symptom relief, and with lower economic burden associated with surgery. 13 Despite the overall reduction in the time to endometriosis diagnosis, a broad range in time to diagnosis was reported among various segments of respondents. Young women, particularly those aged \u00a318 years at symptom onset, experienced significantly longer time to diagnosis than older women. The greater delay was associated with longer delays both in seeking medical attention and in receiving a diagnosis following presentation. These results are consistent with a number of previous reports showing longer time to diagnosis of endometriosis among adolescents and young women compared with older women. 6,10,12 For example, the study of women who completed the 1998 Endometriosis Association survey showed that young women aged <19 years at symptom onset waited an average of three times longer than those aged >19 years to seek medical attention (mean 6 years vs. 2 years) and 2.8 times longer to receive a diagnosis following consultation (mean 5.4 years vs. 1.9 years). 12 Longer time to diagnosis in younger women is thought to be associated with poor awareness of endometriosis symptoms in young women and with failure of physicians to consider the diagnosis of endometriosis or reluctance to consider surgical intervention or empirical treatment in this group. 12 Although the trend toward more timely diagnosis among young women is encouraging, the continued gap in time to diagnosis between younger and older women supports an emphasis on targeting younger women and their physicians for increased education. 26 The burden of endometriosis-related symptoms among respondents in our sample was comparable with that observed in previous studies. For example, a study of 5540 patients with surgically diagnosed endometriosis in the UK General Practice Research Database revealed a prevalence of 25% for dysmenorrhea, 16% for pelvic pain, 9.2% for dyspareunia, and 23% for menorrhagia. 3 These frequencies are remarkably similar to the prevalence reported here for women with a combination of surgically and nonsurgically based diagnoses. The presence of endometriosis-related symptoms was strongly associated with shorter waiting time before seeking medical attention among respondents in our sample, suggesting that symptoms are a key trigger for women to seek medical attention.\nA trend toward shorter time from consultation to diagnosis was noted for patients who reported seeking care for symptoms such as pelvic pain, passage of clots, and constipation/ bloating/diarrhea; however, no single symptom reached statistical significance in this analysis. Clinicians take multiple factors into account when considering a diagnosis of endometriosis or other medical conditions, and further research into physician-related factors (for example, the presence of multiple symptoms) with the potential to impact the time to endometriosis diagnosis is warranted.\nTime from first consultation to diagnosis was nearly two times shorter among respondents diagnosed by OB/GYNs compared with those diagnosed by other specialists. This finding suggests that OB/GYNs are likely better sensitized to the constellation of endometriosis-related symptoms compared with other specialists and indicates that non-OB/GYNs may benefit from greater awareness of endometriosis signs, symptoms, and diagnostic guidelines. It is likely that women who were diagnosed by non-OB/GYNs consulted with a greater number of physicians before receiving a diagnosis 27 ; however, this possibility was not assessed in the current study.\nA considerable strength of the current study is that it included a large nationally representative sample of women who were diagnosed over a 10-year period, suggesting that results should be readily generalizable to a broader population. Our survey limited enrollment to those with a diagnosis within the past 10 years, strengthening the internal validity through control of recall bias. However, the study is also limited in several respects. First, comparison of our results with those from other studies may be affected by the fact that our survey is the first to be conducted entirely over the Internet. Although we incorporated a propensity score, which aimed at correcting for differences between participants in online surveys and the general population, into our algorithm, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of sample bias owing to online methodology.\nSecond, our survey may be limited by unreliable recall among respondents who are asked to recall events from the distant past. 21 We sought to minimize recall bias by limiting our sample to respondents who received the diagnosis within the past 10 years. We also note that previous surveys incorporate a similar recall time. Data regarding diagnostic experience were entirely patient reported; additional studies that include physician input would strengthen our results. Studies replicating our findings using a larger sample of US patients with recently diagnosed endometriosis are also warranted.\nFinally, in contrast with prior studies, we did not restrict our analysis to patients with surgically confirmed diagnoses. Therefore, it was not possible for us to assess the prevalence of misdiagnosis (which has been previously shown to be associated with increased diagnostic delay) among patients in our sample. Although it is possible that inclusion of respondents without surgically confirmed diagnoses would skew our results, we found that diagnostic delay was similar among both groups, suggesting that the overall estimate is robust.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion and future directions", "text": "During 2002-2012, the average delay in endometriosis diagnosis among US women in our sample was 4.4 years, reflecting a major improvement in time to diagnosis over the past 15 years.

or Critical Actors?", "abstract": "Purpose: By 2006, women constituted 34% of academic medical faculty, reaching a critical mass. Theoretically, with critical mass, culture and policy supportive of gender equity should be evident. We explore whether having a critical mass of women transforms institutional culture and organizational change. Methods: Career development program participants were interviewed to elucidate their experiences in academic health centers (AHCs). Focus group discussions were held with institutional leaders to explore their perceptions about contemporary challenges related to gender and leadership. Content analysis of both data sources revealed points of convergence. Findings were interpreted using the theory of critical mass. Results: Two nested domains emerged: the individual domain included the rewards and personal satisfaction of meaningful work, personal agency, tensions between cultural expectations of family and academic roles, and women's efforts to work for gender equity. The institutional domain depicted the sociocultural environment of AHCs that shaped women's experience, both personally and professionally, lack of institutional strategies to engage women in organizational initiatives, and the influence of one leader on women's ascent to leadership. Conclusions: The predominant evidence from this research demonstrates that the institutional barriers and sociocultural environment continue to be formidable obstacles confronting women, stalling the transformational effects expected from achieving a critical mass of women faculty. We conclude that the promise of critical mass as a turning point for women should be abandoned in favor of ''critical actor'' leaders, both women and men, who individually and collectively have the commitment and power to create gender-equitable cultures in AHCs.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T he theory of critical mass, a term borrowed from nuclear physics that refers to the quantity needed to initiate a chain reaction, has been applied to behavioral studies of groups in the field of politics. These studies hypothesized that when 30% of legislative representatives are women, more women-friendly policies are passed. [1][2][3] Critical mass theory applied to gender equity in academic health centers (AHCs) predicts that once the proportion of faculty who are women rises above a threshold of 30%-35% of total faculty, their impact on culture change would be evident. 4 With women represented in AHCs at critical mass levels for almost a decade, 5 we should by now have witnessed changes that reflect their influence throughout our organizations. This would likely result in changes in the sociocultural environment that would trigger an increase in the number of women selected to lead AHC institutions.\nA fundamental assumption of the seminal theory of critical mass promulgated by Kanter over 40 years ago is that ''low relative numbers and the accompanying problems of tokenism affected the social environment of women in the workplace, causing isolation and impeding their ability to effectively perform their jobs.'' 1 She suggested that, having a critical mass increases women's comfort level and eases some of the stress associated with being a minority. Etzkowitz et al. predicted that there would be a discrete point where the presence of a sufficient number of women in an organization would bring about a qualitative improvement in conditions and accelerate the dynamics of change. 6 Background to this study In 2009, we received a grant from the National Institutes of Health, ''Achieving a Critical Mass of Women Biomedical Faculty: Impact of 3 US Programs,'' to answer the following question: Did the participation of women faculty in three career development programs (CDPs) lead to increased numbers of women biomedical faculty in AHCs who were better prepared to assume leadership roles? Our results showed that women who attended at least one of three national career CDPs, (1) endorsed acquiring a set of skills, which better prepared them for advancement and leadership 7 ; and (2) were more likely to be retained in AHCs than non-CDP peers providing a potential for gender equity in leadership. 8 For the purpose of this article, we define gender equity as ''the process of allocating resources, programs, and decision-making fairly.'' 9 In this article, we focus our examination on the theory of critical mass by asking, ''Is having attained a critical mass of women in AHC institutions sufficient to catalyze organizational culture change in specific ways?'' We conjectured that once a sufficient proportion of women were achieved, the AHC culture would become more inclusive of women on many levels, more gender equitable, and less tolerant of gender norms; and more women would assume leadership positions, including deans and department heads.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Population samples, data collection, and analysis", "text": "Our study of critical mass is seen through the lens of two groups: women who had attended at least one of three CDPs between 1988 and 2011, and institutional representatives, both men and women, holding leadership positions in AHC institutions in 2012 (AHC leaders).

Women were purposefully selected based on following criteria: (1) PhD or MD, (2) which CDP they attended between 1988 and 2010, and (3) current academic rank. Biographical experiences before and after CDP attendance were obtained through a series of open-ended questions, such as ''During your [xx] years in academic health center institutions, have you seen a change in the number of women who participate in leadership?'' ''Does this change you describe affect the institution, and if so, how?'' ''What system changes are needed to better include the contributions of women?''

Participants were recruited from the pool of institutional leaders attending national meetings of relevant professional groups.

Two sessions were held in conjunction with the ELAM Alumnae Professional Development Program in December 2011 and seven were held in collaboration with the AAMC meetings (three during the GFA/GDI meeting in August 2012 and four during the GRAND/ GREAT meeting in September 2012).\nParticipants were recruited if they had senior academic rank and substantial leadership/authority and were a current faculty member at an AHC institution. The authors sent invitations to the ELAM alumnae list, while AAMC staff sent invitations to members of GFA, GDI, GREAT, and GRAND. The letter of invitation included information about the NIH grant, its purpose, and the context in which the focus group was being held.

''Thinking about leadership, are you seeing women represented in leadership roles at your institution-specifically are they 'at the table'?''' were used to generate conversations about trends in AHCs, focusing particular attention on collaborative and translational research and faculty trends, institutional and national influences on these trends, and their impact on institutional policies and practice.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CULTURE CHANGE IN AHCS: CRITICAL MASS?", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Analysis of interview and focus group data", "text": "We utilized a systematic, theory-guided approach to text analysis using a category system. This approach allowed us to be open to new interpretations of the content, by using a strictly controlled step-by-step process for analyzing interview and focus group transcripts. This coding and analytical process, called pattern matching and explanation building, is described by Yin as a methodological way to move from a lower to higher conceptual level of data interpretation. 13 The deidentified transcripts were imported into NVivo 10 and analyzed in two stages of content analysis. First, the interviewer coded the data to create coding structures (hierarchical or matrix displays) that conformed to the topics in the interview and/or focus group guides (S.L.N.). Other team members conducted independent review of transcripts (P.M., D.H., and G.C.). S.L.N. also reviewed the matrix displays with the focus group facilitators to gain consensus on the coding approach. Second, the entire research team verified and expanded the original (level 1) codes into higher levels of emergent themes and categories. The final coding display for the focus group data was a matrix organized by themes and categories, the original text and line number in which it appears in the transcript, and researcher comments. 14 For the interviews, a hierarchical display was developed and the research team used the display as a structure from which to interpret higher level data. Internal audits, frequent discussions, and member checking led to multiple edits of the initial coding structures.\nWe systematically compared the above datasets to determine whether they corroborated one another and discrepancies in the data through the triangulation process. Triangulation is a powerful technique that facilitates validation of data through cross verification from two or more sources. In particular, it refers to the application and combination of several research methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon. Triangulation gave us the opportunity to interrelate programs, individual and institutional spheres, and data sets. 15 ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Forty-five former CDP participants were interviewed during 2012. Nine focus groups were held between December 2011 and September 2012; discussants were 74 AHC institutional representatives (51 women, 69%, and 23 men, 31%). Tables 1 and 2 show the pertinent demographics of the interview and focus group participants, respectively.\nThe analyses revealed two domains that are nested within AHCs: the Individual and Institutional Domains (Fig. 1). The data revealed key features within four spheres that influence women's experience as faculty. Even with a critical mass of women faculty ( \u202130%), these experiences are circumscribed by their gender, imposing normative expectations both inside and outside AHCs.  The experience of being a woman in AHCs was found in the following themes: rewards and personal satisfaction of meaningful work, inherent characteristics or personal agency, tensions created by the demands of cultural expectations of family and academic roles, and women's work to achieve gender equity.\nRewards and personal satisfaction of meaningful work.\nMany of the women had considered leaving AHC institutions, yet stayed due to the satisfaction and rewards of academia: I love the academic environment. I learn all the time from my colleagues, residents, and students. There is no way really to impact healthcare in a broad sense outside of academia. All of that makes it an intellectually stimulating environment and the work rewarding. (Interview) Personal agency of women in AHCs. The reasons women gave for seeking career development opportunities revealed ambition and motivation to advance in academia. I've always been an ambitious person who wants to be the person in charge. [CDPs] are key and definitely high on the things I wanted to do. (Interview) I asked three times to go to [CDP] and was told it wasn't necessary for me to go. So I asked again a number of times, and it took a chair change for me to actually go. (Interview)\nConflicting demands/expectations of traditional family and academic advancement. While women desired to progress in their academic careers, they also delayed or deferred opportunities to participate in career development activities and/or advance and assume leadership roles because they embraced their families as high priorities in making career choices.\n[Dean] has been talking to me about doing ELAM for a while, and now that my children are out of the house, I may do it because I see it would be really great. (Interview) I'm the primary parent.That's why now, 10 years into my career, is when I'm finally taking the time to get the proper training I need.it wasn't an option before, so it delayed my career. (Interview)\nA few token women are included on some committees but the power is still with the male hierarchy in general. The men are playing golf on Sunday and making deals. I want to spend Sundays with my kids. It is discouraging, and I think the women who get to the highest levels got there by being men. (Interview)\nWomen working for gender equity. The CDP experiences enhanced participants' personal agency, which gave them confidence to assert themselves and create informal structures such as networks of women who had attended CDPs. I learned to not be afraid to put my ideas out there and tell people what I want.to be more confident and assertive than I might not be otherwise. I realized that I''m not supposed to let my doubts hold me back and just finally stand up for myself. (Interview)\nWhen I came back [from CDP] I recognized that we didn't really have a group of women together in one place..We had a small group of women who would get together once a month. I recognized we needed to do something on a global scale so we reinstituted the women in medicine group and opened it up to everybody in the institution. (Interview)\nWhen I see residents or medical students come through the program, I tend to be more prescriptive or proactive in terms of reaching out to them. You know, a lot of very assertive, overconfident male surgeons have no trouble going out there and getting what they want but some of the women, and even some of the men, tend to be a little more reticent to do that, so I try to coach them in that. And coach them in some of their networking and communication skills, that sort of stuff. So it's a small impact I will have but it's the sort of thing that is important for me. (Interview) Some women established groups to support the career development of younger women; some sought leadership positions and mentored other faculty. Regardless of the obstacles presented above, some women in AHC institutions have promoted each other, with the goal of increasing the The categories emerging from the interview and focus group data were readily grouped into three themes: the sociocultural environment, the institutional influence on women's advancement, and women as leaders. Each of these three themes yielded several subthemes.\nSociocultural environment. Institutional adherence to sociocultural gender norms. The attitudes and actions of faculty demonstrate that traditional gender norms persist.\n[Some of the women have] made a decision to be the trailing spouse. It's based on their own value system. It's not something that is imposed externally. They just decided that they're going to be the one that's the trailing spouse. (Focus Group)\nThe conflict that women have is sitting in a meeting where your partners go, ''Our clinic profit is going down because [interviewee] is taking maternity leave.'' Yet, earlier when one of the male partners' wife ended up in the hospital having a baby, they were, ''Can we take your call? How can we help you?'' I'm like, ''He's not in the hospital. All you can say to me is that I'm going to affect your bottom line.'' (Interview) Lack of institutional strategies to engage women in organizational initiatives. In the normative sociocultural environment, the absence of institutional strategies to engage women in building institutional capacity was evident, even after they demonstrated intent to contribute after their CDP participation.\nIt's not just about ''fixing the women.'' It's about changing the environment so women don't need to be always the ''fixed one.'' (Interview) She did the ELAM Program and she was the interim chair of internal medicine.. and they did a search for a chair and brought in a man to be the chair of the department.

But yet, they wouldn't let her be the chair of internal medicine and she'd been at the ELAM Program.

Fixing the culture and how do you do that? (Focus Group) Unconscious gender bias in behavior and policy. Our results revealed that unconscious sexism persists and is evident in communication patterns, individual behaviors, and institutional decisions to implement policies that differen-tially affect men and women. While well intentioned, the implementation of policies to support faculty life was not found to be gender equitable.\nWhen I was hired in the department of pediatrics I didn't believe this, but now that I've been here 2.5 years, I feel gender discrimination all of the time. It makes me crazy and I can't figure out what to do about it since it's very, very subtle. (Interview)\nOur part-time faculty is disproportionately women trying to balance children at home.

(Focus Group)\nInstitutional influences on women's advancement. Positive or negative influence of individual leaders on women's career advancement. Our results revealed that individual leaders have an important influence, and often autonomy, to contribute to the building or dismantling of critical mass in their organizations. Individual and informal efforts to improve women's visibility and influence. Efforts to improve women's visibility and influence require commitment by individuals and institutions. We did hear about actions by women both as individuals and as a collective, for the sponsorship of women within institutions. Some leaders passively accepted women's efforts to build women's capacity or to develop informal mentoring groups because these leaders recognized the benefits of such initiatives, whether to build institutional capacity or to enhance their image of being a genderequitable organization. While our data include statements reflecting awareness of organizational responsibility, no examples were provided of systematic strategies to meet this obligation.\nI think about how to sustain this. I mean, we've had some good experiences with women in leadership positions, but are we at a new level? A new plateau? Are we continuing to go up? I really don't know. (Focus Group) I looked at the benchmarks after [CDP] and we had only 17% female faculty. So I started putting together grassroots programs and a women in medicine program.

(Interview)\nWomen as leaders. Women in leadership roles. Our data revealed that the act of promoting women to mid-and senior-leadership roles was perceived to be evidence of gender equity.

(Focus Group)", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In this article, we present evidence of the influence of institutional culture and sociocultural norms on women's careers, gained from interviews with women and focus groups with institutional leaders. The findings highlight women's challenges and motivations to remain in AHC institutions, and the ways in which institutions enabled or welcomed their contributions in a meaningful way. The data from focus groups provide the perspectives of national leaders about the involvement of the academic culture in engaging women, in setting policies to support gender equity, and in strategically promoting women to leadership.\nAlthough we never specifically asked a question about critical mass in the interviews or focus groups, the theory of critical mass became a conceptual framework for the analyses presented in this article. Our analysis identified features of critical mass formation that contribute to its effectiveness or ineffectiveness at changing organizational culture. First, the experience of being a woman in AHC institutions includes the rewards and personal satisfaction of meaningful work, inherent characteristics, or personal agency, as well as the tensions created by the demands of cultural expectations of family and academic roles that are changing and may be less acceptable to women and men today.\nWe found that the interface between the individual and the influence and engagement of the institution created a tension that slowed the attainment of the ''promise'' of critical mass. The themes suggested that the interaction between individuals and institutions had an important impact, both positive and negative, on cultural transformation. Also, the influence of one leader's (male or female) action or perspective could catalyze women's career development. On the other hand, the participants and institutional representatives reported myriad examples of organizational subtle, but pervasive adherence to outdated sociocultural gender norms and ineffectual efforts to improve women' experience. These include absence of institutional strategies for engaging women in organizational work, institutional gender bias limiting women's opportunities for leadership, negative impact of gender-equitable policies on women's advancement, and the perception that having women in mid-level leadership roles ''solves'' the problem. All these findings led us to conclude that the answer to our research question (''Is having attained a critical mass of women AHC institutions sufficient to catalyze organizational culture change in specific ways?'') is unfortunately, NO! Critical mass theory posits that having 30% of faculty who are women should be sufficient for women to have made an observable impact on gender diversity and the sociocultural environment of AHCs. The percentage of women in AHCs increased from a few ''token'' faculty (<10%) in 1975 to 33% in 2006. 5 Since 2006, the overall proportion of these women faculty has grown only slightly, from 32% in 2005 to 38% in 2014. 16 In addition, proportions of women in executive positions have shown limited change since 2006; the current proportion does not approach a critical mass of women leaders, which some researchers have suggested is necessary for sustained organizational culture change. 17,18 Women department chairs have increased from about 10% to 15%, and deans to 16%. 5 Even in a discipline where the majority of faculty members are women (54%), very recent evidence documents that the proportion of permanent women chairs in OB-GYN departments rose from 0% in 1981 to only 22% by 2014. 5,[19][20][21] The evidence for an influential role of women as catalysts for change in AHCs has yet to materialize.\nMost of the women participants in this study have advanced to be mid-level and/or senior leaders of AHC institutions; they have been retained and contribute to the critical mass. The interviews and focus group data reveal, however, that the cultures of AHC institutions do not actively/vigorously support the advancement of women faculty to leadership. Despite being underrepresented in the upper echelons, women stay within stagnant hierarchical cultures because of the personal rewards and satisfaction of what they describe as meaningful work. However, their impact as change agents often is foiled by the intransigence of that organization's culture. Jude Browne proposed that ''situations where a disproportionate number of women exist at the level beneath (senior leaders) and the natural progression of these women toward higher levels in the institution does not materialize (sic)-there is, in other words, a 'thwarted critical mass'.'' 22 Therefore, the potential for a critical mass of women to act as a catalyst for a supportive work environment for women at all career stages remains unrealized. [23][24][25][26] Outside of AHC institutions, there is a consensus that attaining a critical mass of women is not sufficient for creating a successful working environment. For example, Dalrup noted that women politicians have conflicting challenges: they must prove they are just as able as men but avoid being seen as to represent only ''women's interests.'' 1 Grey suggests that the theory of critical mass about women in politics is further complicated by the fact that women are by no means a coherent group. 3 Generally, the evidence is mixed; some political studies support the theory and others do not. 27 Recent reports about the field of technology document the failure of critical mass to be a catalyst for change. 28 Given these inconsistent findings, many researchers have been reconsidering whether to abandon the notion of critical mass altogether in favor of ''critical actors.'' 2,[29][30][31] Childs and Krook argued for a shift from focus on a critical mass to what specific men and women (''critical actors'') do to achieve cultural transformation-those who initiate cultural transformation and sponsor others to advance gender equity, even when women form a small minority. 3,[32][33][34][35][36] Unger et al., found evidence that the achievements of women leaders are more influential than those of a critical mass of individual women throughout an organization. 37 Applying the concept of critical actors to AHCs, we revisualize the depiction of the nested spheres of influence to hypothesize how critical actors might transform these institutions (Fig. 2). In this culture, the extrainstitutional critical actors are national leaders of foundations, funders and professional organizations. Intrainstitutionial critical actors include chancellors, deans, department chairs, and others who drive organizational change. The societal expectations of men and women are becoming more gender equitable, creating more flexibility for women. Within AHC institutions, the culture becomes more conducive to choices for women leading to greater recruitment, satisfaction, promotion, and retention. This will lead to a greater proportion of faculty who are women.\nAs with all studies, our research has limitations. Nearly two-thirds of the interviewees had attended more than one of the CDPs, providing a longitudinal perspective of change (or the lack thereof) in the organizational environment. However, the experiences of non-CDP women may be different. Our research found that non-CDP women were less likely to be retained in AHC institutions than their CDP peers. 8 Focus groups of self-selected academic leaders across U.S. AHCs offered their perceptions of gender equity and organizational culture at their own institutions, but these views may not be representative of all AHC leaders or all AHC institutions. Participants may have felt uncomfortable or unwilling to share personal experiences or professional beliefs fully in the focus group setting or in individual interviews. The AHC community is relatively small and individuals are often well known to each other. We were conscientious about redacting any identifying information, but some participants were reluctant to share stories that would make them vulnerable to discovery. Because of our efforts to deidentify transcripts and the nature of focus groups as discussions rather than comments from individual participants, we were unable to disaggregate comments based on seniority, race/ethnicity, gender, or institutional representation.", "n_publication_ref": 30, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study shows that despite achieving a critical mass of women throughout AHC institutions, we have yet to see its promise. One question yet to be answered is whether 35% of women coming through the system is sufficient to exert changes on the environment of AHC institutions in particular. Perceptions about and realities of academia influence career trajectories and sustain unequal outcomes. Our study suggests that two features make a difference: an institutional culture that is highly receptive to changing existing cultural practices and changes in the perception that leadership roles are appropriate for women. [38][39][40] Historically, the industrialized countries have followed a segregated pattern in the division of labor by gender, with work that is defined as being either masculine or feminine. [41][42][43] Research has shown that leaders are more likely to be men than women, or, more specifically, androgynous and masculine persons are most likely to emerge as leaders. 43,44 Society sanctions men's aggressive and competitive behavior, which translates into social and economic power and authority over women. 45 The ''role congruity'' theory 46 has been tested; findings demonstrate that beliefs about leadership style and gender result in prejudice and discrimination toward women leaders, especially those with an autocratic style. [47][48][49][50][51][52] Recent studies show that the United States ranked 28th overall among 156 nations in economic equality and 72nd in political empowerment of women.

To achieve momentum in these areas, leadership must be passionate about and committed to gender equity. 36 To erode the incongruities of being a leader and a woman in an organization, organizations must engage women in the development and implementation of institutional strategies to engage women in organizational initiatives and encourage critical leaders to foster women's ascent to leadership.

Continuing to probe text mining as a tool to identify gender bias in peer review, we used algorithmic text mining and qualitative analysis to examine a sample of critiques from men's and women's R01 renewal applications previously analyzed by counting and comparing word categories. Methods: We analyzed 241 critiques from 79 Summary Statements for 51 R01 renewals awarded to 45 investigators (64% male, 89% white, 80% PhD) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 2010 and 2014. We used latent Dirichlet allocation to discover evaluative ''topics'' (i.e., words that co-occur with high probability). We then qualitatively examined the context in which evaluative words occurred for male and female investigators. We also examined sex differences in assigned scores controlling for investigator productivity. Results: Text analysis results showed that male investigators were described as ''leaders'' and ''pioneers'' in their ''fields,'' with ''highly innovative'' and ''highly significant research.'' By comparison, female investigators were characterized as having ''expertise'' and working in ''excellent'' environments. Applications from men received significantly better priority, approach, and significance scores, which could not be accounted for by differences in productivity. Conclusions: Results confirm our previous analyses suggesting that gender stereotypes operate in R01 grant peer review. Reviewers may more easily view male than female investigators as scientific leaders with significant and innovative research, and score their applications more competitively. Such implicit bias may contribute to sex differences in award rates for R01 renewals.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A dvancing women to institutional leadership in academic medicine is important because diversity drives innovation and productivity, [1][2][3][4] and because female leaders are more likely to promote research on women's health. [5][6][7][8][9][10] Despite the clear benefits of female leaders, women remain disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positions across medical specialties, even among those such as obstetrics and gynecology that attract higher numbers of women than men in early career stages. [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Reflecting this, a 2014 report on the state of women in academic medicine by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) shows that women make up just 21% of associate professors, 34% of full professors, 15% of department chairs, and 16% of academic deans in academic medicine, even though women have been near parity with men as medical students for the past 20 years (45.9%-49.7%). 18,19 Multiple reports show that higher attrition and lower promotion rates for women than men perpetuate the gender/leadership gap. 5,[11][12][13] Career persistence and advancement in academic medicine, particularly to leadership, is predicated on obtaining funding for research, and the National Institutes of Health's (NIHs) R01 grant is the ''gold standard'' for research awards. [20][21][22] R01s provide 3-5 years of funding and can be renewed. Since 1998, the NIH has reported lower funding success rates for renewal applications of R01 (or equivalent) awards for female than male principal investigators (PIs). 23 A study by Pohlhaus et al. on NIH award outcomes confirmed significantly lower funding success rates for women than men who submitted R01 renewals. 22 The NIH leadership acknowledges that unconscious bias may operate in the peer review process. 24,25 For example, Collins (NIH Director) and Tabak (Deputy Director) suggest that the ''Matthew effect''-a combination of accumulated advantage and status that disproportionately propels elite scientists toward success-could explain gaps in NIH award rates. 24 Other studies by Carnes et al. on the nomination, evaluation, and selection processes for high status NIH awards, such as the Director's Pioneer Award and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), make a strong theoretical case that female applicants may be disadvantaged in NIH peer review from bias due to gender stereotypes that may implicitly impact the judgment of reviewers. 26,27 Science has historically been a male dominated field, and gender stereotypes characterize men as intrinsically endowed with the traits associated with ability in science. [28][29][30][31] Several studies have found that stereotype-based bias can influence the written evaluations of men and women in such male-typed fields by engendering doubt about women's ability and competence. [32][33][34][35] Our prior work suggests that text analysis of NIH critiques can provide a window into peer reviewers' decision-making processes and show evidence of cognitive bias, if it occurs. 10,36,37 In studies of NIH outcomes spanning 2007-2009 (NIHs former peer review criteria) and 2010-2014 (NIHs enhanced peer review criteria), we found that critiques of female PIs' R01 applications, particularly renewals, were more favorable despite the receipt of similar or worse proposal scores than comparable men. 38,39 An important limitation of this work is that it relied on simple word count software that assessed the percentage of words in documents from predefined categories, 40 which did not permit examination of reviewers' statements verbatim, or the context in which words were used.\nUsing state-of-the-art text mining algorithms to discover verbatim linguistic patterns in reviewers' critiques of R01 renewal applications provides an innovative solution to address these limitations. 41 In this study, we analyzed a sample of critiques from unfunded and funded R01 renewal applications spanning from 2010 to 2014 using a data-driven algorithm called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). 42 Also referred to as ''topic modeling,'' LDA is an algorithmic Bayesian statistical model that can extract themes or topics in documents. 42 Since human cognition remains ''the gold standard'' for interpreting the contextual meaning of words, 43,44 we developed a tech-nique to extract the text surrounding evaluative words identified with LDA and engaged experts in stereotype-based bias to qualitatively analyze their meaning. 45 The purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which contextually meaningful evaluative differences in critiques of male and female investigators' applications exist, and whether linguistic patterns would differ in ways that suggest gender bias may operate in NIH peer review process for R01 renewals. We also analyzed scores assigned to male and female investigators' renewal applications for significant differences in models that controlled for productivity (i.e., impact factors for publications, and numbers of prior NIH awards).", "n_publication_ref": 54, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data analysis", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "All aspects of this research were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board (IRB). The data used in this study are a subset of NIH Summary Statements (i.e., files that contain reviewers' critiques) previously collected by Kaatz et al. 37 Using NIH publicly accessible database, Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (i.e., project ''RePORTER''), Kaatz et al. identified PIs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with R01 awards funded on the initial submission or after revision between 2010 and 2014. Of the 278 PIs identified, 132 (47%) donated their Summary Statements. NIH only provides information about funded applications, so Kaatz et al. could not request Summary Statements from terminally unfunded applications or assess success rates. From this data set, we extracted Summary Statements from R01 renewal (Type 2) applications (49 PIs). We excluded four PIs' data from analysis because their Summary Statements were dated before the NIH altered its peer review process (i.e., in 2009-2010) or had incomplete information. 38,39 Of the remaining 45 PIs, 64% were men (N = 29/45), 89% were white (N = 40/ 45), 80% held PhDs (N = 36/45), and 91% were ''experienced'' investigators 46 (N = 41/45), meaning they had previously obtained an R01 or equivalent award at the time of application (Table 1). The participating PIs represented 23 different departments; 61% were in the School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH; N = 28/46), and 22% were in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS; N = 10/46). We found no significant differences in the distribution of participants (P) who donated their Summary Statements and nonparticipants (NP) who did not by sex (P, male: 63%, N = 29/46; NP, male: 76%, N = 45/59) or by race (P, white: 87%, N = 40/46 and NP, white: 86%, N = 51/59).\nOur final analytic sample included 79 Summary Statements from 51 R01 awards from these 45 PIs. Approximately onequarter of grants (N = 14/51; 27%) were for clinical research. Twenty-four of the 51 grants (47%) were funded as resubmissions. For these R01s, we had 28 Summary Statements from the initially unfunded submission, and 24 Summary Statements from the subsequent funded submission. The remaining 27 Summary Statements in our sample derived from R01s funded on the first submission (N = 27/51, 53%). Our sample had a total of 241 critiques (85 from unfunded, 156 from funded application Summary Statements). Generally, each Summary Statement contained three to five sets of reviewers' critiques regarding the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' of the proposed work's overall impact, significance, investigator(s), innovation, TEXT ANALYSIS OF CRITIQUES OF NIH R01 RENEWALS 561 approach, and environment; Summary Statements also included an impact/priority score and scores for each of the other criteria (Table 2). 47,48 Summary Statements were de-identified using R software. 49 We extracted scores from Summary Statements and entered them into a database of applicant and application information. Kaatz et al. previously identified each PI sex, experience level, and training background. 36,37 For this study, we added productivity information, regarding PIs' previous NIH awards, and their publication impact. We obtained data on previous NIH awards by searching NIH RePORTER database for each PIs total numbers of NIH grants, by mechanism and year, received before the year of their R01 in our database. We grouped these data into eight categories: Initial R01s (Type 1); Renewal R01s (Type 2), all other R(esearch)-Level Awards; P(rogram) awards; T(raining) awards; Mid-Career Development (K) awards and Mentored Career Development (K) awards; and Pre/Post-Doctoral F(ellowship) awards. We collected information about the impact of each PIs' publications from two sources: from Thomson Reuters Web of Science 50 we retrieved the h-index (a widely used metric based on the number of highly cited articles and the number of citations for each highly cited article, where a higher score indicates higher productivity/impact), and from NIH public-access iCite website (https://icite.od.nih.gov/), we retrieved NIH Relative Citation Ratio (RCR; a measure of the number of articles, and citations for articles, adjusted for field norms, for publications indexed in PubMed, where a higher score means higher productivity/impact). 51 ", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Text analysis", "text": "Quantitative method-LDA to identify evaluative topics in critiques. Using the R open source statistical software pro-gram, 49 we separated each Summary Statement file into two documents, one containing the combined strengths sections and the other containing the combined weaknesses sections from all critiques because the same words may contextually vary based on the assumed positivity and negativity of these sections. For topic modeling with LDA, we used the R package ''mallet'' that implements the Machine Learning for Language Toolkit (MALLET). 52,53 Before submitting documents in our corpus to LDA, we removed uninformative words called ''stop words'' using a predefined list, provided in MALLET, of common English adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. Multiple LDA models were fit, using a range of 2 to 40 topics. We used 1 million sampling iterations for model convergence. We chose the optimal model with 26 topics, using the maximization of the harmonic mean of the model log likelihoods as our model selection criterion. 54 The number of topics generated by LDA can be specified by the user. Topics reflect words with the highest probability of co-occurrence in a collection of documents. Each topic reveals a different theme. It is standard practice for researchers to select a subset of topics relevant to their research question. 55 Using a modified Delphi procedure, [56][57][58][59] we asked a panel of seven peer review experts to evaluate the interpretability of the 26 topics and came to a consensus that one topic was representative of reviewers' evaluative commentary in critiques (i.e., it contained adjectives characterizing the qualifications of PIs and quality of the proposed research); we labeled this topic ''sentiment.'' The remaining 25 topics were about specific areas of research (e.g., dysphagia, molecular biology) and were deemed irrelevant to our research question.\nTo interpret the meaning of words in our sentiment topic, particularly when they co-occur, we first combined the top 30 words from the sentiment topic into all possible pairs (N = 435; e.g., ''highly'' + ''innovative''). Then, we used the chi-square test to rank co-occurring words based on how disproportionately they were used in critiques of men's and women's applications; we retained the top 100 co-occurring words used in higher proportions in critiques of men's, and of women's applications, respectively (Table 3). Next, we wrote a program to extract the sentence(s) surrounding cooccurring words, which we called ''context windows.'' In this technique, we allowed co-occurring words to appear sequentially or up to five words apart. We imposed a fiveword distance limit because as the distance between cooccurring words increases, it becomes less likely that they are meaningfully related. We used the R packages ''stringr'' 60  and ''tm'' 61,62 for working with character-classed variables (i.e., language) and for text extraction, and the package ''openxlsx'' 63 for formatting and exporting context windows for analysis. We implemented a word intrusion test developed by Chang et al. to evaluate the semantic cohesiveness of our sentiment topic. 55 The premise of this method is to see if an outside observer can detect an outlying word in a list of otherwise cohesive words. Within our topic, the top 25 words with the highest probability of co-occurrence were randomly ordered to form five sets of five words each. We then randomly selected an intruder word candidate from each of the remaining 25 topics, for a total of 25 intruder words. These words were randomly inserted into the sets of nonintruder words so that each set contained five nonintruder words and one intruder word. Each of the 15 judges reviewed five such sets and attempted to identify the intruder word in each set.\nQualitative method-thematic analysis. We imported all context windows for our sentiment topic into the NVivo (version 11) Software program for qualitative analysis. 64 To inductively develop cohesive themes, 10,45,65,66 four authors (W.M., A.K., A.F., M.C.) first read through a sample of context windows and generated initial codes through discussion and consensus. Using these codes, two of the authors (A.K., A.F.), blinded to applicant gender and application funding, then coded the remaining context windows. On a randomly drawn subset of 20 context windows, the coders had 95%-99% agreement in code assignment (kappa = 0.96). 10,45,65,66 In an iterative ''constant comparison'' process, the initial codes assigned to all context windows were collapsed into conceptually congruent themes. 10,45,65,66 The coders then explored thematic patterns for male and female PIs' unfunded and funded applications.", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Analysis of scores and productivity data", "text": "To test for differences in scores assigned to male and female PIs' applications, we transformed all scores to a logarithmic scale, because they were skewed, and submitted them as dependent variables for ordinary least squares linear regression with PI sex (M vs. F) as a predictor variable.

Exploration of themes showed unique linguistic patterns for critiques of male and female PIs' unfunded and funded applications (Table 4).\nTheme one-evaluative remarks about the qualifications of the PI. Exploration of the co-occurring words, ''field'' and ''PI,'' with high chi-square rankings for male investigators revealed that reviewers generally characterized male ''PIs'' as ''well-regarded,'' ''respected'' ''leaders'' and ''pioneers'' in their ''fields.'' These descriptors appeared more often in critiques of funded than unfunded applications. The following illustrative quotes are from critiques of different male PIs' applications:\nMale PIs:\n''The PI is a leader in the field with a strong record of research [.].'' ''The applicant is an internationally recognized leader in this field.'' ''The PI is a recognized leader in the field.'' ''[The PI] is internationally known as the pioneer of [.] who is still extending the envelope of research.'' ''[The PI] is a respected, productive investigator who is qualified to oversee the proposed research program.'' By comparison, exploration of words with high chisquare rankings, such as ''expert(ise),'' and standout adjectives, such as ''excellent'' and ''outstanding'' for female PIs, revealed that reviewers generally characterized female PIs as having ''expertise'' in critiques of both their unfunded and funded applications. Reviewers also sometimes characterized them as ''outstanding,'' ''excellent,'' and ''exceptional,'' especially in critiques of funded applications. Illustrating these patterns are quotes from critiques of different female PIs' applications:  (1) innovation, significance, and impact of the proposed research and (2) weaknesses and reviewers' concerns about the proposed approach (e.g., concerns about methods, sample, analysis, or design). In these subcategories, many of the top words in our sentiment topic (e.g., ''innovative,'' ''approach,'' ''significance,'' ''proposal,'' and ''studies'') were used to describe both highly positive and negative aspects of proposals. Different patterns within these subcategories surfaced for male and female PIs.\nReflecting the high chi-square rankings of words such as ''highly,'' ''innovative,'' and ''proposal'' for male PIs, these descriptors appeared to abundantly co-occur in critiques of male PIs' applications, particularly when they were funded. These words appeared to be less likely to co-occur for female PIs. The following quotes illustrate this semantic pattern observed for male PIs: Male PIs:\n''This is a highly significant proposal that addresses an exciting [.] that has not been as well evaluated.'' ''The use of [.] is highly innovative.'' ''[.] offer a highly significant arena for developing methods for [.].'' ''The application is clearly written, compelling and draws on several highly innovative advancements to accomplish the work.'' For the second subtheme-weaknesses and concerns about the approach-reviewers used many sentiment topic words, such as ''potential,'' ''studies,'' ''innovative,'' ''significant,'' and ''impact,'' in a negative context. This observation illustrated the importance of examining the context in which words are used because such descriptors on their own would likely be interpreted as positive. Within this subcategory, we identified different patterns for male and female PIs. We observed that reviewers offered male PIs criticism about their proposals almost reluctantly, as a concession, usually after first describing Innovation, significance, and impact of the proposed work.\nReviewers described male PIs' research as ''highly significant,'' ''highly innovative,'' and ''high impact.''\nAppeared to occur more in critiques of funded applications.\nWeaknesses and reviewers' concerns about the approach.\nReviewers described problems with male PIs' applications, but balanced criticism with praise.\nAppeared to occur similarly in critiques of unfunded and funded applications.\nReviewers described male PIs' research as ''overambitious'' or ''risk,'' but balanced these concerns with assurance of PIs' competence.\nAppeared to occur similarly in critiques of unfunded and funded applications.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Reviewers described female", "text": "PIs' research as having only minor or negligible weaknesses.\nAppeared to occur similarly in critiques of unfunded and funded applications.\n3.

In this concessional sentence structure, top ranked words for male PIs, such as ''studies,'' ''innovative,'' ''significant,'' and ''highly,'' were used by reviewers to temper the impact of critical remarks. This semantic trend occurred in critiques of both unfunded and funded applications for male PIs (as illustrated by examples from different male PIs' application critiques below), but appeared to rarely surface for female PIs. Male PIs:\n''This is a potentially powerful component of the proposed studies, but the narrative was not developed beyond a basic description of the procedure.'' ''Highly innovative, but there are no preliminary data for [.].'' Only in critiques for male PIs (unfunded and funded applications) did reviewers comment about the proposed work being ''overambitious'' or ''risky,'' and these remarks were always tempered by assurance of the PIs' competence. Two quotes from critiques of different male PIs' applications illustrate this semantic pattern:\nMale PIs:\n''Overly ambitious and elaborate proposal, however investigator has excellent track record in executing and completing his proposed work.'' '' [.] is more risky, but PI has demonstrated work with [.] already.'' By comparison, concerns and criticism in both unfunded and funded application critiques of female PIs' applications were generally more mild in tone (e.g., ''this is a minor concern''), and included top ranked words for female PIs, such as ''work'' and ''strong.'' These two quotes from critiques of different female PIs' applications illustrate this finding:\nFemale PIs:\n''A negligible weakness is that the [.] is not explained; it would help to [.]. A related negligible weakness is that the [.] group has already done significant work in characterizing the [.].'' ''Overall these minor weaknesses did not lower my enthusiasm for this very strong application.'' Theme three-evaluative remarks about the quality of the research environment. This theme dominated female PIs' critiques of funded applications, but appeared less likely to occur for male PIs. In critiques of female PIs' applications, top chi-square ranked words, such as ''environment,'' ''strong,'' ''outstanding,'' ''excellent,'' ''proposed,'' ''studies,'' and ''research,'' were used to describe aspects of the research environment. Illustrating this trend are several illustrative remarks from different female PIs' applications: ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "In this mixed methods study, we demonstrated that latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, ''topic modeling'') may be useful for analyzing scientific peer reviewers' remarks especially when combined with qualitative thematic analysis. We found different thematic patterns of evaluative remarks in reviewers' critiques of male and female PIs' unfunded and funded applications. We also found that female PIs' applications were assigned significantly worse (i.e., higher) significance, approach, and overall priority scores (Fig. 1). Importantly, productivity/impact measures (i.e., h-index, RCR, and NIH awards), which we used as a proxy for the quality of PIs' research, did not account for disparities in male and female PIs' application scores. This suggests that some other factors may have influenced reviewers' decision-making.\nA large body of experimental and observational research spanning the past 40 years shows that gender stereotypes can influence reviewers to differentially evaluate men's and women's work and their qualifications in male-typed fields, such as science. 5,12,13,26,27,32,37,[67][68][69][70][71][72] Our results strongly align with this work. Specifically, stereotypes that men are agentic (e.g., leaders, logical, independent) and women are communal (e.g., supportive, sensitive, dependent) influence reviewers to assume men have high competence, will be more likely to succeed, and are a better ''fit'' for male-typed jobs and roles (e.g., such as scientists) that are assumed to require agentic skills and traits. 5,12,13,26,27,32,37,[67][68][69][70][71][72] As R01 renewals are high status awards in a male-typed field and have criteria that align with performance expectations for men and leaders [i.e., applicants are expected to have ''an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)''], 73 we posit that gender bias may have impacted NIH reviewers' judgment and could explain our results in several ways:\nFirst, gender bias can lead reviewers to more easily perceive men as ''leaders [74][75][76][77] and assign greater value to men's than women's credentials (even when credentials are similar). 78 This may explain why, in our study, reviewers appeared to more easily perceive male PIs as ''pioneers'' and ''leaders in the field.'' Although reviewers characterized female PIs as having ''expertise,'' such descriptors have less positive valence as they are more frequently used to describe the value of consultants, collaborators, or contributors-roles that more closely align with stereotypes about women (e.g., women are ''communal,'' ''helpful,'' ''cooperative''). 67,69,79 Moreover, someone with expertise may know a lot about a subject, but a respected leader is regarded as a strong contributor and driver of change-a very agentic role that is congruent with stereotypes about men. 67,69,79 Although subtle, if gender bias leads reviewers to differently interpret male and female PIs' qualifications and accomplishments, as our study suggests, it could translate to penalized scoring and funding outcomes for female applicants because PIs of R01 renewals are expected to be scientific leaders. 73 This would explain worse (i.e., higher) priority, approach, and significance scores assigned to female than male PIs' applications with similar productivity.\nSecond, such bias can lead reviewers to perceive the same work as more valuable when thought to be performed by a man. 1,80,81 This may explain why reviewers in our study appeared to more easily view research proposed by male PIs as ''highly significant,'' ''highly innovative,'' and ''high impact.'' Because significance, innovation, and impact are important criteria for determining scores and funding outcomes, female applicants could face disadvantages if gender bias leads reviewers to more easily view research proposed by male PIs as higher in value for NIH.\nThird, gender bias can lead reviewers to be more willing to provide constructive critical feedback to men than women, which has been shown to bolster career development and success. 82 This may explain why reviewers in our study appeared to provide male PIs criticism accompanied by positive remarksas such a style of feedback is more often used for members of positively stereotyped groups to help improve future performance. 82 Moreover, Correl and Simard found that women are more likely to receive vague instead of constructive feedback. 83 If this occurs in NIH peer review, as our results suggest, female applicants would be less likely to benefit from peer reviewers' expertise, which would disadvantage them, particularly if their proposals were unfunded and required revision.\nSeveral other studies on gender bias in evaluation processes may help explain our observation that some women and their research were described as ''outstanding'' and ''exceptional.'' For example, experiments show that assumptions that women are less competent than men can lead reviewers to hold female applicants to higher ability standards to confirm their competence. 68,72,84 Thus, words such as outstanding and exceptional used to describe women and their work may be evidence of reviewers requiring higher quality work and stronger track records of past performance for female than male PIs. Other studies show that when pro-male gender bias operates in a review process, it can lead to men's advantage on the criteria that matter most (e.g., numerical rankings) for obtaining a tangible reward (e.g., a job, promotion, funding), which is compensated for by advantaging women on criteria that matter least (e.g., written commentary). 32,68,77,[85][86][87] Importantly, results from our previous studies found that more critiques of female PI applications for R01 renewals contained standout adjectives (e.g., outstanding, excellent), despite assignment of worse or similar priority, approach, and significance scores, 36,37 which are tightly linked to funding outcomes at NIH. Taken together, these and our current findings suggest that the latter interpretation (pro-male bias in consequential numerical rankings compensated for by pro-female bias in less consequential commentary) may be most likely. Future experiments are needed to establish causal reasons for the greater occurrence of standout adjectives in critiques of female PI R01 renewal applications.\nOur final finding that female PI research environments were characterized as ''outstanding'' and ''exceptional,'' predominately when their applications were funded, adds to literature regarding the relationship between institutional, departmental, and laboratory climate; and women's career persistence and advancement in academic medicine. This body of work links poor climate to attrition from research careers. 1 Findings from our study suggest that women who successfully persist in research may be in better environments or that reviewers are likely to assume there is a strong environment if women are successful. Alternatively, environments may be positively impacted when women persist in research careers. Future studies are needed to more concretely examine the direction of the relationship between the climate of the environment in which research is conducted and women's persistence and success in research careers.", "n_publication_ref": 57, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Implications and future directions", "text": "This study shows scoring disparities and complex linguistic differences in critiques of male and female PIs' R01 renewal applications. Such differences may be consequential to funding outcomes. If women systematically earn worse scores on their R01 renewals, as we found in our study, this might explain why they have lower R01 renewal success rates, nationally. Our study builds on previous studies by Carnes et al. on other high status NIH awards, such as the Director's Pioneer Award and the Clinical Translational Science Award, which suggest that NIH review criteria and male-typed descriptors may inadvertently favor men. 26,27 If future work identifies gender bias as a factor for female PIs' lower funding success rates for R01 renewals and other high status NIH awards, interventions that approach bias as a changeable habit may be helpful for NIH reviewers, as they have proven to be effective at reducing stereotype-based bias for faculty in science fields. 88 If text analysis proves useful as a flag for bias in peer review, it has the potential to be of use to funding agencies and policy makers interested in leveraging the substantial untapped information available in written critiques both to test for bias in peer review and to test the impact of bias reduction interventions.

We examined data from a single site, and a single NIH award type, so results may not generalize to the population of investigators who obtained R01 renewals between 2010 and 2014 and those who had other types of awards. Due to the small sample size (and consequential identifiability) of underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in our sample, our analyses only targeted applicant sex. LDA does not consider the context in which words are used, but we overcame this limitation by using thematic analysis. We did not have access to terminally unfunded applications (i.e., applications that were unfunded and never revised) since all initially unfunded applications in our sample were funded in subsequent resubmissions. Because of this we could not estimate funding success rates or test for differences in funding success rates. We did not have access to raw numbers of male and female PIs' publications; instead, we used h-index and RCR scores, and raw numbers of NIH awards as surrogate estimates for productivity/impact. Consequently, we could not assess the extent to which raw numbers of publications differed for male and female PIs in our sample, and whether this might explain scoring differences. There is research showing that men publish more than women, which may be a consequence of differences in resources or differential impact of work/life balance and family responsibilities. 24,[89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98][99] However, this publishing gap disappears when controlling for career stage/rank, 100 and almost all PIs in our sample (98%, N = 44/45) were experienced investigators (Table 2) and had held NIH funding for similar lengths of time (M = 14.2 vs. F = 12.78).", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Combining data-driven algorithmic text mining methods with qualitative thematic analysis allowed us to detect different patterns of evaluative feedback in critiques of male and female PI R01 renewal applications.

We carried out a cluster-randomized, multifaceted intervention to improve the success of women assistant professors at a research-intensive medical school. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven departments/divisions were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The three-tiered intervention included components that were aimed at (1) the professional development of women assistant professors, (2) changes at the department/division level through faculty-led task forces, and (3) engagement of institutional leaders. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between assignment and outcomes, adjusting for correlations induced by the clustered design. Results: Academic productivity and work self-efficacy improved significantly over the 3-year trial in both intervention and control groups, but the improvements did not differ between the groups. Average hours worked per week declined significantly more for faculty in the intervention group as compared with the control group (-3.82 vs. -1.39 hours, respectively, p = 0.006). The PhD faculty in the intervention group published significantly more than PhD controls; however, no differences were observed between MDs in the intervention group and MDs in the control group. Conclusions: Significant improvements in academic productivity and work self-efficacy occurred in both intervention and control groups, potentially due to school-wide intervention effects. A greater decline in work hours in the intervention group despite similar increases in academic productivity may reflect learning to ''work smarter'' or reveal efficiencies brought about as a result of the multifaceted intervention. The intervention appeared to benefit the academic productivity of faculty with PhDs, but not MDs, suggesting that interventions should be more intense or tailored to specific faculty groups.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "S ince the mid-1990s, women have comprised nearly half of the medical school graduates in the United States and yet women are still underrepresented in senior ranks and leadership positions in academic medicine. Numerous stud-ies have documented the slow advancement of women compared with men faculty in medical and biomedical careers as well as the stubborn persistence of this disparity over the past two decades. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The National Academies' extensive analysis of gender disparity concluded that ''Transforming institutional structures and procedures to eliminate gender bias is a major national task that will require strong leadership and continuous attention, evaluation, and accountability.'' 9 Although many institutions have developed and implemented programs to promote the careers of women faculty, there is little empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of such programs. Most interventions in academic medicine have been limited to pre-post evaluations, [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] or focused on a single causal problem, such as implicit bias. [21][22][23] Only a few have had a randomized design. 23 A recent review of faculty development interventions found that only 2 out of 41 studies included a comparison group and most relied only on post-intervention questionnaires. 24 Research in innovative interventions is essential to drive evidence-based change efforts to remediate gender disparities. In response to this critical gap in research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a funding opportunity to investigate causal factors and interventions that affect the careers of women in science. Funded through the NIH initiative, this study, the NIH-TAC (Transforming Academic Culture) Trial, evaluated the impact of a 3-year cluster-randomized intervention designed to improve key indicators of academic success among women assistant professors as well as to drive broader changes in culture at the department and institutional level of a research-intensive medical school.", "n_publication_ref": 25, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sample", "text": "Of all clinical and basic science departments at the institution, eligible departments were required to have three or more women assistant professors.

The first level focused on professional development for women assistant professor faculty. The second level consisted of department/ division faculty task forces and their department-specific change initiatives. The third level engaged department/division chairs and chiefs and other institutional leaders, including the School of Medicine Dean and Vice-Deans. We describe each of the three levels of the intervention in greater detail below.\n(1) Professional development of women assistant professor faculty. Prior research on the causal factors in gender disparities has identified academic productivity and work-life integration as two of the key barriers to women's career success. 8,25 As a result, we designed the professional development level of the intervention to target these two factors affecting career progression. To enhance academic productivity, intervention faculty participated as a cohort in a semester-long, intensive Manuscript Writing Program of eight workshop sessions. Two senior women medical faculty taught evidence-based skills for overcoming common barriers to scholarly productivity combined with peer and senior mentoring. 26 To develop skills related to managing work and life demands, the cohort of intervention faculty also participated in the nationally recognized Total Leadership Program. 27 The Total Leadership Program consisted of four seminars with intensive activities between sessions, including experiments to improve performance in all spheres of life-work, home, community, and self-by finding mutual value among them through engagement with key stakeholders, reflection, and coaching. In the second and third years of the trial, supplemental professional development sessions were held to maintain peer support, offer additional mentoring, and promote ongoing skill development. Attendance at all faculty development sessions was tracked.\n(2) Department/division faculty task force initiatives 28 . Within each of the 13 intervention departments/ divisions, the respective chair or chief each appointed a faculty member to chair their task force and also selected a group of associate and full professor men and women faculty members to serve on the task force. Each task force was charged with creating and implementing a specific department/division initiative to improve their local environment for women's career success. Through 6 months of intensive strategic planning meetings with a recruited outside facilitator with expertise in leadership and innovation in healthcare, each task force designed an initiative and developed metrics of success. In the subsequent 2 years, the initiatives were implemented and evaluated. Progress and challenges were discussed in annual summits to which members of the 13 intervention task forces, respective chairs and chiefs, the School of Medicine Dean, and senior leadership were invited to attend. In the final summit of February 2013, all faculty in the intervention arm were encouraged to attend as each task force presented their accomplishments and discussed future goals. Examples of task force initiatives include the implementation of home reading work stations in the Department of Radiology, an overhaul of on-call scheduling for junior faculty in a pediatric division, and a grant development initiative in a basic science department that included a mock study section for grant review.  closely with the dean, vice-deans, chairs, and chiefs to generate top-down support and accountability for change. An NIH-TAC Trial research team investigator met with each chair or chief of the intervention departments/divisions every 6 months for the duration of the trial to elicit their feedback and continued full participation. The two primary responsibilities of these intervention senior leaders within their departments/divisions were (1) to encourage the full participation of intervention women assistant professors in the trial faculty professional development initiatives and (2) to oversee and support the task force process. In addition, an intervention summit was held each year in which intervention chairs/chiefs were brought together with task force members along with senior leaders in the medical school, to report on progress and learn from each other.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Control group", "text": "All chairs/chiefs of eligible departments/divisions agreed to participate before randomization.

The survey instrument included validated measures of socio-demographic factors, education, academic work history, marital status, children, work hours, work self-efficacy, work-family conflict (WFC), and department/division culture. 29 A subset of these measures (described below) were identified as additional key outcomes for the success of women faculty.\nWork hours. Work hours were indicated by an openended response to the question, ''How many hours, per week, do you spend on work-related activities?'' If participants provided a range of hours, the mid-point of that range was utilized.\nWork-family conflict. WFC is defined as a form of interrole conflict in which the demands of work and family are ''at odds.'' 30 Meta-analytic evidence indicates that WFC is linked to important career-related outcomes such as turnover, burnout, well-being, and job and family satisfaction. 31,32 Two dimensions of WFC were assessed. Time-based workinterference-with-family (TWIF) is the perception that the time demands of work interfere with participation in the family role. Strain-based work-interference-with-family (SWIF) is the perception that the stress from work has a negative impact on family life. 33 Each dimension was assessed with three items and scored on a five-point scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Prior research has indicated that these scales are distinct, reliable, and valid measures of facets of WFC. 33 In the current study, the Cronbach's alpha reliability of the sub-scales were a = 0.87 for strain-based WFC and a = 0.69 for time-based WFC.\nWork self-efficacy. Work self-efficacy was measured by using two items adapted from Riggs et al. 34 and scored on a 1-5 Likert-type scale. An average of the two items was used to create the scale (a = 0.80).\nDepartment/division culture. To assess the specific dimensions of department/division culture that are the most relevant to the experiences of women faculty, we developed a measure for the purposes of this research assessing the culture that is conducive to women's academic success (CCWAS). CCWAS is defined as the shared perceptions regarding the extent to which the department/division culture is supportive of women's careers (See Westring et al. 29 for an in-depth description of measure development, reliability, and validity). Briefly, CCWAS is a higher-order culture measure that is indicated by four dimensions of culture for women's careers: (1) support for work-life balance; (2) equal access to opportunities; (3) freedom from gender bias; and (4) chair/chief support. The measure consists of 45 items rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), with higher scores indicating a more supportive department/division culture. The overall scale had a reliability of a = 0.95.\nThe CCWAS measure of each department/division was determined by calculating the average ratings reported by the women assistant professors whose primary appointments were in that department/division. Our analysis of the CCWAS measure provided empirical support for the equivalence of the measure for both department and division units, and they are, therefore, treated interchangeably.\nNon-trial faculty development participation. All participants were asked to report whether they had participated in faculty development sessions during the previous 3 years. Intervention faculty were asked about activities other than those developed for the intervention. Control faculty were asked whether they had participated in any faculty development program and, if so, how many. No questions were included about the duration or type of educational activity. Co-intervention in the control group was analyzed according to whether they had participated in any faculty development programs and if so, how many, during the period of the trial.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis and sample size", "text": "Generalized linear models were used to estimate group averages and to test associations between each outcome and intervention. Key outcomes included individual faculty change in hours worked, work self-efficacy, WFC, grants, and publications. In addition, changes in department/division culture were assessed. Statistical tests were adjusted to account for correlation induced by the clustered design using generalized estimating equations. 35 Both within-person factors (age, years in rank, race) and unit-level factors (intervention assignment) were modeled simultaneously. Overall, an intention-to-treat analysis was used. To further clarify our results, we investigated whether level of participation in the faculty development programs (Manuscript Writing Program and Total Leadership Program) within the intervention condition was associated with degree of change for the individual outcomes. The level of participation was assessed by testing for associations with outcomes in high (attending the majority of sessions) versus low (attending less than the majority of sessions) participation levels. A pre-specified subgroup analysis was also conducted based on educational degrees. We tested for associations of intervention condition with outcomes separately by type of degree. We developed three categories of education degrees: (1) MD only-faculty did not have other advanced degrees; (2) MD+ included MD faculty who had other advanced degrees, including PhDs; and\n(3) PhD faculty with or without other advanced degrees except for MDs. MD/PhDs were included in the MD+ category.\nSample size was estimated based on a hypothesized increase in peer-reviewed publications. We assumed a type 1 error of 5% and a power of 80%. Estimates for expected averages as well as standard deviations (SDs) were gathered from a sample set of CVs previously provided by nonparticipant women faculty in which the average increase was 1.5 publications over 2 years (SD = 3).

During the 3-year period of the trial, one participant withdrew from the study due to health reasons. Of the 133 faculty who participated throughout the trial, baseline questionnaires and CVs were obtained from 132 out of 133 (99.2%); follow-up questionnaires and updated CVs were provided by 126 out of 133 participants (94.7%).

Specifically, we tested pre/post differences within the intervention and control groups separately and found statistically significant improvements in both groups in grants, total peer-reviewed publications, work self-efficacy scores, and hours worked per week (Table 2). However, there were few statistically significant differences in the intervention group compared with the control group (see Table 2). No differences were detected between intervention and control faculty in any measure of academic productivity (i.e., publications and grant status). When we examined publications by year, though not statistically significant, there was a trend toward greater numbers of publications in the intervention group in 2012 and 2013. We did not find statistically significant differences in any of the other key outcome measures except for hours worked per week. Participants in the intervention group reported a significantly larger decrease in work hours compared with the control group (-3.82 hours vs. -1.39 hours per week, respectively; p = 0.006).\nThe overall evaluation was based on an intention-to-treat analysis. However, in supplemental analyses, we assessed whether there were differences within the intervention group assistant professor women based on their level of participation in the Manuscript Writing Program and Total Leadership Program. We found that those with high participation rates (attending more than half of sessions) had more than a twofold increase in peer-reviewed publications (rate ratio = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-3.39, p = 0.006) compared with those who participated less often (Fig. 2).\nWe explored the possibility that the impact of the intervention varied by type of academic degree. In faculty with PhD degrees (but without MD degrees), the intervention group had a 92% increase in first-author publications and a 131% increase in first-author peer-reviewed publications compared with control faculty with similar degrees (firstauthor publication rate ratio = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.13-3.29, p = 0.02; first-author peer-reviewed publication rate ratio = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.34-3.99, p = 0.003).

We asked intervention faculty about activities in addition to those provided through the intervention. Although both intervention and control faculty reported high rates of attending one or more non-trial faculty development programs, there were no statistically significant differences in participation rates between the groups. Of note, more than 65% of women faculty in the control group reported having participated in one or more faculty development programs during the trial period, with nearly half (49%) participating in two or more programs. However, we cannot compare the characteristics of the faculty development programs (e.g., duration, type, intensity, etc.) between the groups, as we did not collect that information.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We evaluated the impact of a 3-year multifaceted intervention in a cluster-randomized trial at a research-intensive academic health center on the career success of women assistant professors. By implementing a multilevel approach to institutional change, we demonstrated the feasibility of a school-wide effort, including both clinical and basic science departments. At the same time, our trial demonstrates the challenges involved in conducting ''real world'' research of professional development programs and institutional change efforts when blinding of the intervention is not possible and when outcomes are best measured over many years, possibly even decades. We found important but comparable levels of improvement in academic productivity and work self-efficacy in both intervention and control groups. If the trial had not included a concurrent control group, the improvements in our outcomes would have likely been attributed to the intervention.\nOne interpretation of our results is that our intervention was not effective in improving these outcomes. However, despite a rigorous randomized controlled study design, there are alternative explanations that may suggest that, in fact, the multifaceted intervention was potentially effective. An alternative interpretation is that the major improvements in both groups resulted from the trial itself, that is, the Haw-thorne effect. The trial was highly visible at our institution, and it is likely that extensive knowledge of the trial and strong support of the senior leadership at multiple levels affected both control and intervention departments/divisions and the women assistant professors in those departments/divisions. A notable strength of the trial was the full engagement of all eligible departments and divisions (100% participated). In addition, the Dean of the School of Medicine chaired the trial's National Advisory Committee and the President of the University served as one of the members. The legitimacy and prestige of NIH funding contributed, at least in part, to the commitment to the trial that was demonstrated at all levels of  the medical school. We believe that this large-scale effort over 3 years may have brought about some measure of widespread institutional change, thus resulting in the reported improvements in both the intervention and control groups.\nOther results support the interpretation that the intervention was at least partially effective. We found that PhD faculty in the intervention group appeared to benefit in increasing the number of publications whereas intervention MD faculty did not. It is possible that the MD faculty, who have rigorous clinical requirements, less flexible schedules, and ''divided attention,'' were, therefore, less able to focus on academic productivity. These results suggest that the MD faculty may need a more intensive or different intervention. Interventions tailored to specific faculty groups may be the most effective.\nAnother positive finding was that intervention faculty who attended half or more of the sessions increased their publication rates significantly more than those who participated less. This may indicate that a sustained level of participation in the interventions was required to demonstrate an impact on academic productivity. It is also possible that faculty with sufficient time and/or flexibility to fully participate had the motivation, resources, and support to increase their productivity.\nThe academic productivity measures evaluated in this study represent key outcomes assessed for promotion, tenure, and attainment of leadership positions. However, given the relatively long time frame required to prepare and revise manuscripts and grants, the fact that CVs were collected shortly after the 3 year intervention concluded may not have allotted adequate time to detect intervention effects. The trend toward greater productivity in the intervention group toward the final year of the trial may indicate a need for a longer assessment period. A longer time frame would arguably be better for measuring other outcomes too, such as the culture change in the departments/divisions that were being impacted by all levels of the intervention. The Task Force initiatives, in particular, may have needed more time to fully evolve to have a visible impact on the measurement of culture.\nYet another promising finding was that the hours worked per week declined significantly more in the intervention group compared with the control group. Given equivalent levels of increases in the number of grants and publications, it appears that intervention faculty attained comparable levels of academic productivity in fewer work hours. This is not surprising given the purpose and methods of the intervention professional development programs for the assistant professors (i.e., the Manuscript Writing Program and the Total Leadership Program). In Total Leadership, participants designed and implemented experiments that were intended to better align their actions and their values. The goal of the program is that participants gain a more effective integration of work and the other parts of their lives and, in doing so, may also develop a more personally effective use of time. In addition, the Manuscript Writing Program may have enhanced efficiency in writing, thus also reducing the hours required for equivalent levels of productivity. It is also possible that the Task Force initiatives were addressing department/divisionspecific issues that enabled more efficient use of faculty time. Given the high work demands placed on academic faculty, programs that provide tools for working ''smarter'' and for reducing, even by a relatively small amount, the average work week hours are important in addressing the work-life challenges of academic careers.\nThere were several limitations to our study. First, the study was limited to women assistant professors. This focus was predicated on the well-established fact that women have long been underrepresented in senior ranks and leadership positions in academic medicine. 9 It was beyond the scope or required intent of the NIH funding opportunity to carry out interventions and measure outcomes in both men and women faculty. Second, it is important to note that the results from this trial may not be generalizable to other academic medical centers with different metrics of success for faculty advancement or without an ''up or out'' system.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The NIH-TAC Trial was a multifaceted cluster-randomized intervention trial involving an entire medical school over 3 years with the overarching goals of improving the academic success of women assistant professors and improving the culture that was conducive to women's success in individual departments and divisions.

To support this, mothers need *500 kcal of energy per day for breast feeding, 16 which is delivered from the fatty tissue that they accumulated during pregnancy. Change in this physiology is related to adverse maternal health outcomes. Breast feeding is associated with a protective effect on maternal metabolic diseases. Most previous studies reported that breast feeding is associated with a decreased risk of components of MetS, such as obesity, 17 hypertension, 18 and diabetes. 19,20 Breast feeding was also associated with MetS. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, breast feeding was associated with a lower incidence of MetS among women years after weaning and after adjustment for possible confounder. 21 In CARDIA study, relative hazard range as risk reduction associated with longer breast feeding was 0.14-0.56 ( p = 0.03) in gestational diabetes mother (GDM) group and non-GDM groups and was 0.44-0.61 ( p = 0.03) in non-GDM group after adjusted for possible confounders. In the SWAN (Study of Women's health Across the Nation) study, women who breastfed their children exhibited a lower risk of MetS than those who had never breastfed. 22 In their study, women with long breast feeding had significantly decreased ORs for MetS (ORs; 0.79, 95% CI, 0.63-0.99) compared to those who never breastfed. However, there are inconsistent findings. A recent Iran study showed that breast feeding was not protective in the development of MetS. In this study, Korean young and middle-aged women who breastfed for 12-23 months were associated with a lower risk of MetS, and women who breastfed for \u202124 months had a lower risk of MetS than those who breastfed for 12-23 months. Our results support the hypothesis that breast feeding plays a protective role in the development of MetS.\nA longer duration of breast feeding is associated with a lower risk of MetS and its components. In a study of the Danish National Birth Cohort, a longer duration and greater intensity of breast feeding was associated with reduced postpartum weight retention. 23 A longer duration of breast feeding was associated with a reduced risk of T2DM after controlling for confounders. 24 In the Women's Health Initiative observational study, an increased duration of breast feeding was associated with a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. 25 However, inconsistent findings were observed between a longer duration and metabolic risk. In a prospective study by Stuebe et al., a dose-response relationship was not observed between breast feeding duration and metabolic risk during a 3-year follow-up period. 26 Actually, the underlying mechanism of the association between a longer duration of breast feeding and metabolic risk is not fully understood. One possible explanation is that breast feeding, a normal physiologic form of energy expenditure, may influence persistent, protective maternal health outcomes. This explanation is supported by animal models. In mice, maternal BP and visceral adiposity at 2 months postpartum were significantly higher in nonlactating mice than that in lactating mice. 27 Another explanation is that breast feeding may be associated with maternal health through stress reactivity. Women who breastfed have reduced hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal axis activation and greater vagal tones. 28 The levels of basal norepinephrine and ACTH, cortisol, and glucose responses to exercise were significantly decreased in lactating women than those in nonlactating women. 28 Additionally, lactating women who were aggressive exhibited lower SBP than formula-feeding or never-pregnant women who were nonaggressive. 29 In this study, breast feeding for 12-23 months was associated with decreased risks of elevated BP, elevated glucose, and MetS. Breast feeding for \u202124 months was associated with lower risks of elevated glucose and elevated TG. These findings were in agreement with previous reports and hypotheses explaining the relationship between breast feeding and MetS.\nUnexpectedly, we found that the association of breast feeding with elevated BP was attenuated with an increasing duration of breast feeding among the group of women who breastfed for \u202124 months. This may be related with parity. Increased parity is associated with a longer duration of breast feeding in this study. Parity is associated with a greater left ventricular mass. 30 Additionally, there is a 40% increase in blood volume during pregnancy with no increase in SBP; this is related to a simultaneous reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. 31 Childbearing may have long-lasting effects on the cardiovascular system. A series of studies that evaluated the association between childbearing and the prevalence of hypertension in later life reported that childbearing was associated with decreased SBP or DBP. 32,33 Gunderson et al. 32 reported that the first childbearing was associated with a decrease in BP. In a recent Australian study, parity was associated with a lower risk of high BP, and women who had given birth had significantly lower adjusted ORs for high BP than nulliparous women. 33 However, increased parity may have adverse health outcomes later in life. 34,35 There is some evidence indicating that parity has nonlinear associations with hypertension 36 and diabetes. 37 Parity \u20214 was significantly associated with increased adjusted ORs for hypertension in the Trabzon Hypertension Study. 34 A recent U.S. population-based study demonstrated a nonlinear association between parity and the carotid distensibility coefficient, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and women who had two live births had significantly lower distensibility than women who were primiparous or multiparous \u20213. 36 In our study, women who breastfed \u202124 months were more likely to be multiparous \u20213 in their lifetime than those who breastfed \u00a35, 6-11 or 12-23 months. This may be related to the attenuated association between duration of breast feeding for \u202124 months and elevated BP. However, parity was adjusted as one of the confounders in multivariate logistic regression analyses in this study. There may be the underlying mechanism of between longer duration for \u202124 months and elevated BP. Further studies are needed.\nThis study has potential limitations. First, this study was conducted with a cross-sectional design, and causality between breast feeding and MetS cannot be identified. Second, the intensity of breast feeding could not be used for the analyses. Third, this study was based on the individuals' memory for duration of breast feeding, which is related to the possibility of information bias. However, breastfeeding is a major concern for women raising children, and recall of breastfeeding is considered to be reliable over many years. Fourth, our results could not be analyzed in relation to pregnancy-related problems, such as gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes, that may be related to MetS in later life. 38 Finally, it is desirable that mediation analyses BREAST FEEDING AND METABOLIC SYNDROME could be performed to evaluate which components of MetS are related to longer duration of breast feeding in this study.", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "A nationally representative, population-based crosssectional study found that Korean young and middle-aged parous women with lifelong breast feeding for \u202112 months were at a lower risk of MetS than those with lifelong breast feeding for \u00a35 months.

Professional titles may influence the perceived expertise and authority of the referenced individual. The objective of this study is to examine how professional titles were used in the same and mixed-gender speaker introductions at Internal Medicine Grand Rounds (IMGR). Methods: A retrospective observational study of video-archived speaker introductions at consecutive IMGR was conducted at two different locations (Arizona, Minnesota) of an academic medical center. Introducers and speakers at IMGR were physician and scientist peers holding MD, PhD, or MD/PhD degrees. The primary outcome was whether or not a speaker's professional title was used during the first form of address during speaker introductions at IMGR. As secondary outcomes, we evaluated whether or not the speakers professional title was used in any form of address during the introduction. Results: Three hundred twenty-one forms of address were analyzed. Female introducers were more likely to use professional titles when introducing any speaker during the first form of address compared with male introducers (96.2% [102/106] vs. 65.6% [141/215]; p < 0.001).

[1][2][3][4][5][6] In this context, gender bias has been identified as one of the drivers of gender disparity in academic advancement and remains a significant challenge for women in the workplace. [7][8][9][10] Gender bias can be subtle and may be further reinforced through the use of gender-subordinating language and by choice of level of formality (i.e., style) in forms of address (e.g., formal title, first name, nickname). [11][12][13][14] Word choice and selective use of forms of address may reflect conscious or unconscious assumptions about gender roles. 1,11,15 Ideally, in a professional setting, occupational/professional titles and informal names should be used equally among men and women. In settings where professional titles convey expertise and competence, failure to acknowledge the title may influence the perceived expertise and authority of the referenced individual. The manner in which individuals refer to a fellow professional may introduce a linguistic expectancy bias, whereby subtle systematic variations in language, such as the use of a professional title or not, not only reflect stereotypic expectancies, but also strengthen them, reinforcing a lack of equity in the workplace. 16 Nonreciprocal address practices in mixed-gender interactions may encourage a preconceived power differential and contribute to the reinforcement of gender stereotyping. This practice may influence institutional culture and inadvertently further gender bias and even gender discriminatory practices. 8 Within professional environments, individuals may assume shared norms of a particular linguistic network or community of practice and, therefore, differences in formality can signal intentional, subconscious, and/or institutionalized behavior. 17 Within academic medicine, studies have demonstrated the presence of linguistic biases in RO1 grant reviews and letters of recommendation for medical faculty seeking tenure, suggesting gender stereotyping may impede career advancement of women. 11,13 A recent report highlighted the importance of self-identification by professional title when resident physicians answered pages in the hospital. The use of title was recognized to convey their role on the team, establish credibility, and display professionalism. 15 Anecdotal reports 18,19 and observation of nonreciprocal address practices in mixedgender interactions at professional meetings and academic medical centers prompted us to more formally evaluate these occurrences. We sought to determine how forms of address were used in same-and mixed-gender interactions occurring in the setting of regularly occurring formal conferences in an academic medical center.\nIn the field of medicine, Internal Medicine Grand Rounds (IMGR) represents a formal setting in which the majority of participants in both the role of speaker and audience member are physician and scientist peers holding MD, PhD, or MD/ PhD degrees. In this professional setting, the expectation is that an appropriate formal introduction of each of these degreed participants would include the use of the title, ''Doctor'' (Dr.), as fitting with current standards of professionalism and etiquette. 20 We hypothesize that female speakers in this professional setting are more often addressed by first name or equivalent than their male counterparts during speaker introductions.\nWe, therefore, sought to examine the association between gender and address practices used during formal introductions of speakers in IMGR.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "We conducted a retrospective observational study of forms of address used during IMGR at our institution.

Speaker introductions occurring at consecutive IMGR at 2 different campuses from January 1, 2012, through July 20, 2014, were analyzed for forms of address used. Mixed-gender coding teams of 2 coders per team were assembled. Each coder underwent formal training in evaluation of the presentations, coding strategies, and reporting structure. The teams were trained at an organizational meeting and those who could not participate in person were provided the slide presentation and written materials. Intercoder reliability was assessed utilizing standardized introductions with all coders required to attain 100% accuracy before participation. A male and female reviewer coded each verbal introduction noting the form of address used in the introductions. The use of mixed-gender coding teams was intentional to decrease or eliminate any unconscious bias on the part of the coders.\nA total of 134 unique grand rounds presentations listed in a video archive library were accessed and reviewed for inclusion in the study. Grand rounds presentations were excluded from analysis if the speakers did not have doctoral degrees (n = 3), video was not available for review (n = 5), or review of the grand rounds was conducted by only 1 coder of the review team (n = 1). One video was excluded as no speaker introductions were made. Participants were identified as either introducer or speaker depending on their role in the verbal interaction being observed. Introducers were defined as those making the introduction and speakers were those being referred to during the introduction. IMGR introducers are selected based on a variety of factors, including subject matter expertise, hosting division, or session theme. Each grand rounds presentation could contain multiple speakers requiring introductions. Of the 124 grand rounds reviewed, 83 had more than 1 introduction (introducer introducing the speaker) with each introduction representing an opportunity for the introducer to utilize the appropriate professional title. Each grand round had between one and five introducers. We restricted the analysis to the sessions where both the introducer and speaker had a doctoral degree ( MD/PhD/Pharm D/DMD). We analyzed the form of address used in up to 5 speaker introductions in each grand round. In the analysis, each introduction on the same date was treated as an occurrence. Within an occurrence, there was one introducer and one speaker. We recorded gender and credentials of introducers and speakers as: 1 = Dr. Full Name; 2 = Dr. Last Name Only; 3 = First and Last Name; 4 = First Name Only. We collapsed the above 4 into 2 responses: speaker was addressed by professional title (1, 2) and speaker was not addressed by professional title (3, 4 above). The primary outcome of interest was whether or not a speaker's professional title was used during the first form of address. As secondary outcome, we evaluated whether or not the professional title was used in any form of address within the same occurrence.

However, there were striking differences in how males utilized their informal introduction style depending on whether the speaker was a man or woman. While women consistently and nearly universally introduced both male and female speakers by their formal titles during first form of address, men used male's formal title during introductions 72.4% (110/152) of the time ( p = 0.007), whereas acknowledging female speakers with their professional title only 49.2% (31/63) of the time ( p < 0.001) (Table 1).\nWhile the first form of address is significant in establishing a tone of respect and credential acknowledgement at IMGR, our secondary outcome was to evaluate whether or not the professional title was used in any form of address (first and all subsequent) during the introduction before the speaker assumed the podium.

When all introductions by men were included, the rate of utilization of professional titles increased slightly, but a gender difference remained (Table 2). Despite multiple opportunities to acknowledge the speakers' credentials, the title of Dr. was withheld by male introducers from 41.3% of female speakers compared with only 24.3% of male speakers. Within popular literature, there are many anecdotal examples of professional women encountering the ''insidious slights'' of nonreciprocal address practices occurring in mixed-gender, professional workplace interactions. [18][19][20] Additionally, the reinforcement of gender hierarchy that occurs by not acknowledging the professional title of female speakers further reinforces the social norm that men are of higher status than women. 21 Gender differences in both content and use of titles were common in a study of over 300 letters of recommendation for academic positions. 13 Letters written on behalf of women compared with men were shorter, raised more doubts, contained hedges, unexplained comments and ''faint praise,'' and used language that reinforced gender stereotypes. Analogous to our study, letters written for men compared with women were 4 times more likely to highlight multiple professional titles beyond Dr. 13 This study supports what many female physicians have experienced and discussed informally; the withholding of their professional titles when they are referenced or addressed by their male colleagues. Perhaps this is made more noticeable by our finding that women use formal titles close to 100% of the time for both the men and the women they introduce. This formal practice by women may engender an expectation of reciprocity, thus, further amplifying the disparity. While we did find that men are less formal overall and do withhold the professional title of Dr. during the first form of address from over one quarter of male speakers, it is important to view the experience from the perspective of the female speaker. As she prepares to assume the podium for her formal presentation, she will hear her formal title from almost all of the female introducers; however, she has less than a 50% likelihood that a male introducer will set the tone in the first form of address by calling her ''Doctor.'' Word choice and selective use of forms of address may reflect conscious or unconscious assumptions about gender roles 1,12,13 and may be a demonstration of ''in-group'' bias. 21 The concept of in-group and out-group bias purports that members of the in-group typically hold status, power, and prestige. 22 Men in academic medicine belong to the in-group, and one of the tools for maintaining male power is the use of gender subordinating language. As members of the ''outgroup,'' women may benefit more from an external conferral of status through a title than men, who are already assumed to have status. However, women may suffer a greater loss of status when that title is withheld. 23 Expectation of formality may vary depending on the setting in which the introduction occurs and on organizational culture; however, whatever the setting and culture (formal vs. informal), it should affect men and women equally at any organization. Our rationale for examining introduction style in the formal setting of IMGR was that it is the most likely professional encounter, where one might expect consistent use of a formal title in contrast to small group presentations, or work rounds in academic medicine given their informal nature and more casual settings. While the desire to be called Dr. varies greatly in academia, many doctors ask to be called by their first name or nickname in professional settings. 18 There is a crucial difference between an individual asking to be called by his or her first name, and having the informality assumed by others. 24 In the first scenario, the power remains in the hands of the academic/professional; in the latter it does not and is a form of gender bias, which potentially dictates subsequent behavior. Failure to use a woman's professional title is a subtle reinforcement that women are of lower status and may be one of the factors contributing to the consistent  finding that female physicians are paid less than their male counterparts are less likely to be appointed to leadership positions and are more likely to pursue career tracks with historically fewer opportunities for academic promotion 10,[25][26][27][28][29] Additionally, using or withholding professional titles may introduce a linguistic expectancy bias, contribute to stereotype threat, and reinforce a lack of equity in the workplace 8,16 The significance of these linguistic biases lies in the fact that they implicitly communicate stereotypes to the individual, in this case women in medicine, and thereby contribute to the transmission and maintenance of socially shared stereotypes which ultimately have the potential to affect both the recipient and the audience. Perceived inequities within academic medicine do matter. One of the major contributors to low job satisfaction and burnout is a worker's sense of inequity in the workplace. 30,31 Many women working in academic medicine feel marginalized, as they perceive themselves to be outsiders, reporting feelings of isolation and not belonging. 32 Not receiving verbal acknowledgement of their professional status, and therefore recognition as equals, may further add to the feeling of marginalization by some women. 33 Unequal forms of address can also be viewed as microaggressions, the brief daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial, gender, sexual orientation, or religious slights and insults to the target person or group. 34 More specifically, as a microaggression, unequal address practice is a form of microinvalidation; words and actions that exclude, negate, or nullify someone's thoughts, feelings, or reality. In other words, not acknowledging women and men professionals in a consistent and equivalent manner propagates unconscious gender stereotypes. 33 Gender equity in academic medicine remains a challenge despite dedicated efforts and the adoption of policies which have significantly reduced overtly discriminatory and stereotype-based gender bias practices. 10,14,35 In addition to equal access, supportive leadership, and work-life balance, freedom from gender bias has been identified as one of the distinct dimensions in a work environment that contributes to a woman's ability to be academically successful. 35,36 Gender bias is challenging to address as it occurs across many domains and impacts multiple processes that are intrinsic to driving career advancement. 37 The goal of true gender equity for women physicians and scientists working in academic medicine transcends numerical parity and requires a fully inclusive ''culture conducive to women's academic success (CCWAS).'' 35 Efforts to effect change have led to a broader understanding of the issues underlying practices that encourage gender inequity. Overt discrimination is usually obvious and well recognized by those experiencing it, whereas more subtle forms of gender bias are difficult to describe, explain, and to address especially when inflicted upon an individual who may feel unsafe to address the practice as it occurs. Furthermore, unrecognized aspects of an organization's culture may have different effects on men and women. The subtle role language abstraction plays in hindering women's careers has been documented. 33 Efforts to address unconscious bias require awareness of the subtleties of behavior and language that contribute to a culture of gender disparity and inequity. 4 Evidence suggests that stereotype-based bias operates much like a habit and thus could be addressed in a systematic way. 4 A number of interventions to remediate gender bias in academic medicine have shown promise. 3,4,10,38,39 Furthermore, it has been found that the acknowledgement of practices that demonstrate gender bias and stereotype threat lessens the negative impact on those most affected. 8,40 It is our hope that objective documentation of the gender disparity identified in speaker introductions at IMGR will provide validation to women who have experienced it.\nThe institution of formal guidelines for speaker introductions at IMGR can be a first step toward addressing the findings of this study. Guidelines could include expectations for length and content of introduction and that all speakers are introduced with the use of their professional title. IMGR, often the flagship conference for the Department of Medicine at many academic medical centers, is imbued with historical precedent and expectation for formality. The broad reach of the conference has the potential to influence a critical mass of faculty, thus, leading to effective change in institutional practices and culture 4 ", "n_publication_ref": 46, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study limitations", "text": "Certain limitations of our study must be considered in the interpretation of the results. This was a retrospective analysis representing presentations that occurred in one department (internal medicine) within the same institution, although at two different campuses, and the findings may not be generalizable to other settings. We could not ascertain if race or religious affiliation played a role in the use of informal forms of address as we did not assess these characteristics among the observed speakers. Also, the study was not designed to address the issue of age/seniority or prior familiarity between introducer and speaker as this information was not available in the video archive. However, in order for these variables to negate the findings of the study, the assumption would have to be made that the majority, if not all of the women, were younger, more junior, and had no prior familiarity with the speakers they were introducing. Finally, further studies, if we are to offer a comprehensive view of gender bias, should take into account issues of intersectionality (for example, gender cross-studied with race, ethnicity, and economic status), which often disproportionately affect women of certain backgrounds.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Despite substantial gains in the number of women graduating from medical school and achieving status as faculty members, there remains a significant difference in the way men and women are perceived and treated in academic medicine. In this study, we demonstrated a potential contributor to these gender differences in the form of unequal forms of address used to introduce female and male faculty of equivalent educational level. Although these findings confirm the anecdotal experience of female faculty who encouraged us to explore this issue, we acknowledge that additional variables not analyzed in this study may have impacted our results. Subtle, yet pervasive practices, reinforcing the perception that women are of lower status than men, can negatively impact a woman's career trajectory and her satisfaction with her career even if they are unintentional. 14 Unequal naming practices may amplify the issues of isolation, marginalization, and professional discomfiture expressed by women faculty in academic medicine. 32 Even if this practice is unintentional, it may reflect subtle yet important inequity. The findings in this study support the need for academic and professional organizations to explore whether subtle types of bias are present in other settings. Identification of this issue is only the first step. Our hope is that this study will encourage further discussion and commitment to the development of guidelines for speaker introductions at all departmental levels and functions as IMGR has the potential to influence the way colleagues interact with one another.

They were asked to complete a web-based baseline survey. The study protocols and questionnaires related to the KNHS are based on the Nurses' Health Study 3 (NHS3) in the United States, although they were modified to reflect the Korean lifestyle.

The drinking rate has not changed over the past 10 years, but heavy drinking in Korean women is on the rise. 4 Therefore, smoking and drinking habits are threatening women's health. Stress due to poor work-family balance is also a serious risk factor for women's health. Women with a spouse suffer from more stress than single women or the general population. 5 Given that women are usually the primary caregivers and that women's health has a direct effect on themselves and their offspring, women's healthcare issues need to be prioritized in the public health domain over a full lifetime as well as during the reproductive years. Registered nurses would be a good target population for a female cohort because of their knowledge about medical conditions, high interest in health, and the presence of a nurses' registration system. Previous cohort studies of nurses, such as the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) in the United States initiated in 1976, [6][7][8][9] made valuable contributions to our understanding of the long-term effects of various health-related events on women (such as oral contraceptive use and cancer, cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease [CVD], postmenopausal obesity and breast cancer, and diet and breast cancer), and its success highlighted the feasibility and advantages of recruiting nurses for long-term cohort studies of women's health. The NHS was initially designed to investigate the potential long-term consequences of oral contraceptives, and it has expanded its scope to cover the relationship between chronic illnesses and many lifestyle practices, including smoking, diet, physical activity, postmenopausal hormones, and genetic markers. 8,9 The NHS2 is an ongoing prospective cohort study (begun in 1989) that examines oral contraceptives, diet, and lifestyle risk factors in a population younger than the original NHS cohort. 8,9 The NHS3 is the next generation of the NHS and includes nurses from more diverse ethnic backgrounds than the NHS and NHS2. Inspired by the U.S. NHS, other nurses' cohort studies have been initiated in Denmark, 10 Japan, 11 and Thailand. 12 Several other landmark prospective studies of women have increased our understanding of women's health. Examples are the Iowa Women's Health Study, 13 the Shanghai Women's Health Study, 14 the Swedish Mammography Cohort, 15 and the Women's Health Initiative. 16 Korea has seen improvements in terms of gender equality and accessibility to healthcare, but support for research into women's health is relatively limited. Moreover, only few large prospective cohort studies devoted to women's health (including reproductive health, occupational health, mental health, and other chronic diseases) have been undertaken in Korea.\nShifting trends in Korea, including the rapid transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases, dramatic changes in the fertility rate, and social changes due to rapid economic growth, support the need for a de novo cohort study that is aimed at identifying both risks and preventive factors related to women's health.\nThe Korea Nurses' Health Study (KNHS) is the first prospective cohort study to investigate the impact of occupa-tional, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors (including work-life balance, diet, alcohol intake, smoking habits, physical activity, and reproductive factors) on the health of Korean women. The study protocols and questionnaires were based on those used by the NHS3 17 in the United States and were modified to address specific research questions in Korea.

To ensure the study questionnaires' relevance to Korean health research needs, some of the questions were modified or eliminated and new questions were added (Table 1).\nThe most important modifications involved assessment of diet and occupational hazards. Specifically, the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in the Korea Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) was used to assess current diet. The KNHANES-FFQ was developed for adults older than 19 years and has been validated among Korean adults. 19 To assess dietary patterns during adolescence, the KNHANES-FFQ was modified by updating the food list to reflect foods available at the time the participants were aged between 13 and 18 years. To collect information regarding dietary intake during adolescence by women now aged 20-45 years, all 156 women in that age bracket were asked to note all food items on the KHANES-FFQ that they consumed more than twice a month during their time spent in middle and high school. In addition, they were asked about food items frequently consumed during adolescence but that were not included in the adult-FFQ. Based on these data, nutritionists included and/or deleted food items to construct new adolescent-FFQ.\nModifications to the occupational hazards assessment section included additional questions about the types of chemotherapy agents handled, participation in safety education, symptoms after exposure, and whether medical follow-up was undertaken after exposure. Questions related to shift work were also modified because shift work patterns in Korea differ from those in the United States.

The response rate of the participants who enrolled in the baseline study compared with the number of female nurses aged 20-45 years working at hospitals is shown in Figure 1. More than 10% of eligible nurses joined the KNHS in most cities and provinces (except Jeju-do province). Although the target population for the KNHS comprised registered female nurses aged 20-45 years, 265 subjects aged 40-49 years also completed the baseline questionnaire. Considering the average age of menopause in Korean women (roughly 50 years), the KNHS steering committee decided to prospectively follow these additional 265 nurses, but it did not include them in the baseline analysis.\nTable 2 shows the baseline socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants. The mean age of the participants was 29.4 -5.9 years, and more than half were in their 20s. About two-thirds were not married, and the education level was similarly distributed between 3-year (47.4%) and 4-year nursing programs (45.2%). More than half (58.2%) of the nurses were regular drinkers, although the prevalence of current smokers was very low (1%). Most women (71.9%) had never been pregnant, 9.5% experienced one pregnancy, and 17.9% had two or more pregnancies. Among women who had been pregnant, the mean age at the end of the first pregnancy was 29.6 -3.6 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 20.9 -2.7 kg/m 2 : *80% of respondents had a BMI below 23 kg/m 2 , and 15.3% were underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 ).\nShift work characteristics are shown in Table 3.

Prospective cohort studies involving nurses, such as the NHS and NHS2 studies, provided significant results regarding women's health, even though those results were derived from a selected population. Thus, the risk factors and exposure identified will be useful for disease prevention, despite the particular characteristics of the NHS study group (e.g., high level of education, profession, and a specific occupational environment). However, such results are not generalizable because there are environmental, ethnic, and genetic differences among the population. The KNHS was designed not only to investigate the health problems of Korean women but also to compare ethnic and environmental differences between populations.\nAs this was an international collaborative project, the study questionnaires were translated and modified from the original FIG. 1. Response rates of study participants in each province ( 0%-5%, 6%-10%, 11%-15%, 16%-20%, 21%-25%). NHS3 questionnaires. However, differences in culture, dietary patterns, and working conditions meant that some questions and response items in our survey were different from those in the original U.S. version.\nThis study enrolled 13% of active Korean female nurses aged 20-45 years. We compared age and regional distribution between participants and non-respondents and found that, compared with non-respondents, a slightly higher   proportion of participants were in the 40-45 years of age group and lived in a metropolitan area. These differences were statistically significant (possibly due to the large sample size) (data not shown).\nThe KNHS is a web-based survey. Compared with mailbased surveys, web-based surveys are cheaper, have higher response rates, and ensure wide participation by all demographic areas. They also reduce the time and money spent on data quality control because data are coded and entered automatically. [20][21][22] The participants in our cohort were distributed across the whole country. However, some provinces had higher (Incheon and Daejon) or lower ( Jeju-do) participation rates than others; it is difficult to identify the reasons for these differences. Overall, the data reflect the characteristics of female nurses across the whole country.\nThe overall health profile of the participants revealed that the majority of nurses were non-smokers (99%) and more than half (58.2%) were regular drinkers. This is in contrast to the 2013 Korean data on current smoking status, which reported that 6.2% of adult women and 9.1% of women in their 20s are smokers. 23 In addition, the prevalence of obesity among participants in this study (8.3%) was lower than that among adult Korean women (25.1%) or women in their 20s (14.4%). 24 However, 15.3% of respondents were underweight, which is much higher than the proportion (6.9%) reported in the 2007-2009 data. 25 This high proportion of underweight women may be explained by the fact that gastrointestinal problems were the most commonly reported health issue (25.8%), which may be linked to occupational factors and diet, among other factors. Subsequent modules of the KNHS included the FFQ, eating habits at the workplace, and working conditions; therefore, future KNHS data should enable us to further understand factors related to being underweight.\nShift work, classified as work primarily outside normal daytime hours, includes night and rotational work 26 and is an intrinsic occupational characteristic of hospital nurses. It is considered a risk factor for chronic disease, including CVD, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. 26,27 Epidemiologic studies show that shift work increases CVD risk by about 40%, and that night shift work is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and other cancers. 27,28 A study conducted before the KNHS and aiming at examining the association between lifestyle factors and Korean women's health enrolled 10,000 female nurses; the results revealed that those who worked shifts more frequently were more likely to be overweight or obese. 29 Although we found that shift work was age dependent, the results suggest that special attention should be paid to nurses working shifts for long periods. There are several hypotheses about the biological mechanisms linking shift work to health problems; indeed, changes in circadian rhythm, sleep disturbance, stress, and behavioral changes are all potential mediators. 27 We found that 88.4% of the participants had worked night shifts, which is higher than that reported by NHS and NHS2 in the United States. 30,31 This difference is likely due to the nature of Korean nurses' shift work, which generally includes all time shifts (day, evening, and night) on a rotating basis; by contrast, the U.S. system offers fixed shifts, for example, nightonly and daytime-only options. The mean lifetime duration of night shift work was 5.3 years. The long-term effects of shift work on nurses' health should be investigated in the KNHS.\nThe KNHS is an ongoing investigation of women's health. The Module 1 survey was closed in October 2014 when it reached the target number of participants. Modules 2 and 3 began in March and November 2014, respectively; Module 4 began in September 2015.

However, no studies have directly contrasted the clinical profiles of Veterans between military-related traumas. Moreover, a notable gender difference in the likelihood of trauma exposure limits our ability to disentangle gender and trauma type. Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we aimed at (1) contrasting psychiatric complaints in Veterans with MST versus MCT exposure and (2) investigating gender differences in Veterans with MST histories. Treatment-seeking Veterans (N = 563) completed semi-structured diagnostic interviews and self-report assessments of PTSD, depressive, and dissociative symptoms. Results: Psychiatric complaints and morbidity were notable after all military-associated traumas, although those seeking care for MST-related events demonstrated more severe PTSD, depressive, and dissociative symptoms and were more likely to meet criteria for non-PTSD anxiety and psychotic disorders. In contrast, few genderrelated differences were noted between male and female Veterans with histories of MST. Conclusions: The experience of MST may reduce typically observed gender-related buffering effects for certain conditions.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W omen are the largest growing military subpopulation. 1 Women Veterans endorse experiencing military sexual trauma (MST) at rates that are 20 times higher than their male Veteran peers, 2 and their roles within combat environments continue to expand. 3 As such, it is imperative to increase our understanding of how gender or types of trauma exposure may be associated with clinical presentations to provide the most suitable care for trauma-exposed treatment-seeking Veterans.\nNotably, military-associated traumas are particularly salient risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its related mental health problems. Epidemiological research suggests that male and female Veterans with military combat trauma (MCT) are four times more likely to develop PTSD than their peers who are not exposed to combat. 4 PTSD is similarly pronounced among Veterans with histories of MST, a trauma subtype that has received heightened attention in recent years. Available empirical data indicate five-to eightfold higher PTSD rates among female Veterans exposed to MST and three-to sixfold higher PTSD rates among male Veterans compared with Veterans not exposed to MST or the general population, respectively. 4,5 Despite emerging evidence that women Veterans and those who have experienced MST are at increased risk for PTSD, the clinical needs and presentations of these subgroups are vastly understudied. It cannot be assumed that empirical findings related to male Veterans seeking treatment for combat-related traumas will be generalized to their military peers. Attention to the interrelationships between MCT and MST exposure, gender, and psychological concomitants may offer unique insights to improve treatment planning, augment our ability to clinically address PTSD and accompanying complaints, and effectively serve the needs of understudied Veteran subpopulations (i.e., women, those with histories of MST).\nMuch of the existing literature contrasts Veterans' gender or trauma type to understand varying rates of psychological concomitants. However, it is important to extend beyond examining which groups appear to ''suffer most'' after trauma to attend to the clinical presentations commonly encountered, particularly cases of comorbidity. 6 Participant selection further hinders our understanding of military-associated traumas. Currently, studies have recruited through survey formats or incorporate all Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) patients.\nThis type of research may be suitable for understanding the larger population of traumatized Veterans. However, this methodology diminishes our ability to recognize and adequately respond to Veterans when they present for services to address their trauma history. For example, if it is the case that event-related disclosure stigma varies by gender and results in differentially diminishing the likelihood that some groups of Veterans will present for care after particular types of exposure, descriptive mental health studies based on the population as a whole may be less generalizable to clinical environments. For instance, it is possible that women Veterans are less likely to experience substance use problems than their male peers, but that they are more likely to elect to present for treatment when these problems are present. In contrast, it may be that they are more likely to delay seeking services until use problems are more pronounced. Evaluating the potential for differential clinical presentations for women and those with histories of MST may augment our ability to provide care for an increasingly diverse Veteran population.\nFurther, some evidence suggests that women may respond differently to traumatic experiences than their male peers, irrespective of trauma type. In systematic reviews of gender differences in civilian and Veteran populations, women are generally demonstrated to experience higher rates and severity of PTSD and particular comorbid psychiatric conditions. [5][6][7] However, two studies described similar PTSD symptoms in male and female Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) Veterans despite gender differences in MST and MCT exposure rates, though their findings regarding depressive symptoms were inconsistent. 8,9 Several theories have been proposed to explain women's differential risk of particular mental health diagnoses. First, physiological divergences (i.e., chemical, genetic propensity for fear acquisition, etc.) and differential behavioral coping responses are pronounced and vary by gender. Although women may utilize fewer active coping skills, they are often more likely to self-disclose distress or seek mental healthcare. [10][11][12] Female Veterans are more apt to report pre-military trauma exposure. These earlier traumas may exponentially increase their risk for adverse outcomes when they are faced with additional military stressors. 6 However, studies of military samples have not replicated this consistently. 5 For example, Hourani et al. 13 recently found that active duty women had higher overall PTSD symptoms and had stronger symptom responses in light of injury-related combat traumas, whereas men with histories of lifetime sexual trauma exceeded PTSD severity scores of women with similar histories. Continued evaluation of the relative importance of gender and trauma type appears especially warranted for service members.\nResearch that is focused on associations between trauma exposure and mental health consistently confirms the presence of various negative psychological outcomes, in addition to PTSD, after both MCT and MST. Veterans who meet criteria for PTSD secondary to combat often struggle with comorbid mental health concerns such as depression, non-PTSD anxiety disorders, dissociation, and substance use. [14][15][16] Similarly, individuals reporting a history of MST are more likely to meet PTSD criteria and show higher rates of substance use, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, and disordered eating behaviors compared with Veterans who do not report MST or civilian women with adult sexual trauma. [17][18][19][20][21] However, the existing literature has limited ability to account for clinical differences that may be particularly relevant.\nSpecifically, the dearth of studies directly comparing Veterans with MCT and MST inhibits the recognition of characteristics that may impact mental health trajectories and treatment selection decisions post-trauma. To illustrate this, MST survivors must often continue to work and reside alongside their perpetrators, potentially prolonging stress exposure and inhibiting trauma recovery. 22 Military culture emphasizes collectivism, individual strength, and loyalty. After MST, many Veterans describe stigma, fear of consequences, and a loss of control and privacy. Superior officers may be responsible for the incident or advise survivors not to report incidents that may be seen as career threatening. MST survivors may be labeled as troublemakers and discharged from the military, often resulting in a sense of betrayal and a loss of social and economic resources. Combat experiences may involve increased exposure to physically graphic material involving injury or death. For many, deployment to warzones involves repeated trauma exposure that may extend for multiple tours, involve concomitant environmental stressors, and disrupt access to social support networks. 23 Further, from the perspective of the Emotional Processing Theory, 24 the meanings attached to traumatic experiences serve salient roles in the development and maintenance of PTSD and associated negative affective states (sadness, guilt, disgust, anxiety, anger). Given the military trauma that event types may differ in, in either the nature of the event itself or, potentially, disparate meaning elements, it is possible that survivors may experience their PTSD differently (i.e., differences in trauma-related cognitions, situations that evoke hyperarousal and intrusions, changes in interpersonal connections and behaviors). Further research of clinical correlates of these experiences is warranted.\nAnother limitation of the current empirical literature on military-associated traumas has been the use of genderrestricted participant selection. Regarding MCT-related PTSD, most studies have focused on male Veterans given their historically greater exposure to warzone traumas. Similarly, investigations of MST generally include women Veterans exclusively or contrast Veterans with MST with all other Veterans, irrespective of possible MCT exposure. Although less attention has been afforded to male survivors of MST, emerging evidence suggests that they may express heightened concerns of being publicly ostracized, shamed, or perceived as non-masculine. 25,26 Some evidence indicates the characteristics of sexual trauma differ by gender. For instance, male Veterans appear more likely than their female peers to describe MST that is repetitive, involves multiple assailants, and includes simultaneous physical battery. 5 To evaluate these issues, Kimerling et al. 2 researched mental health presentations among male and female Veterans with and without reported MST. They demonstrated that several disorders were more prevalent in those reporting MST, although the strength of these relationships varied by gender. Specifically, women Veterans with positive MST screens were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders than their male counterparts endorsing MST. Although MST was associated with elevated rates of bipolar disorder, the odds ratio for this diagnosis within the context of MST was less pronounced for women. For other disorders, gender did not appear to pose unique risks for clinical symptoms after MST. Their results suggest that MST may moderate the association between gender and Veterans' mental health symptoms.\nHowever, Kimerling et al.'s study contrasted those with and without MST histories, and the percentage of those with MCT experiences was not reported. This methodology renders it impossible to disentangle whether reported gender differences reflect responses to any trauma or whether these results are specific to MST and would not generalize to MCT. Further, the positive MST screening used to derive groups is not, necessarily, indicative that MST events would satisfy diagnostic criteria for PTSD.\nTo date, the disentangling of clinical presentations that are associated with gender and military trauma exposure type has been difficult. To address this gap, we aimed at describing the prevalence and severity of psychological complaints experienced by treatment-seeking Veterans. To achieve this goal, we contrasted clinical intake evaluation profiles separately for military-associated trauma (MCT vs. MST; Aim 1) and for men and women after MST (Aim 2).", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Procedures", "text": "Veterans seeking treatment at a Midwestern VHA specialty PTSD clinic between 2005 and 2013 completed all measures as part of a standard intake.

Our descriptive study supports previous research indicating high levels of comorbidity in the context of PTSD for Veterans endorsing either MCT 14,15 or MST 17,19 and extends our knowledge to the clinical presentations that are the most commonly observed among women Veterans seeking treatment that is associated with military-related traumas.\nOur findings have significant direct clinical applications. Although dissemination barriers persist, treatment outcome research has confirmed the benefits of trauma-focused interventions (i.e., Prolonged Exposure [PE] Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy) to reduce PTSD and depression in the context of MCT and MST. [36][37][38] However, researchers investigating MST and MCT-related interventions may need to concurrently assess outcomes beyond PTSD and MDD to evaluate recovery from a broader array of concerns. Although MST and MCT were associated with similar PTSD severity, those with MST presented with greater symptoms of depression and dissociation and comorbid diagnoses of anxiety and thought disorders. Clinically, the significantly higher severity of dissociative symptoms within the context of MST may underscore a need for comparative studies to identify whether trauma-focused interventions are differentially effective in the context of PTSD with prominent dissociative complaints. However, we stress that the magnitude of observed differences between MCT and MST groups on continuous measures was small. Further research with larger samples of individuals presenting secondary to MST exposure may be beneficial to ascertain whether these differences are robust and clinically meaningful.\nOf particular relevance, Schnurr et al. 39 contrasted PE therapy and presented centered therapy in a population of female Veterans seeking treatment primarily for sexual traumas. PE was associated with reductions in PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms though improvements in comorbid symptoms were generally moderate in size and did not extend to alcohol or substance use complaints. Additional treatment outcome studies focusing on commonly described symptoms other than PTSD and depression continue to be warranted. Given the complexity of clinical presentations with MST, care providers must be especially skilled at integrating empirically based protocols with fidelity and flexibility and at attending to varying presentations (i.e., integration of PE and Exposure and Response Prevention for cases with comorbid PTSD and OCD, clinical management of dissociation).\nAlthough previous investigations in civilian populations have suggested that women are at an increased risk for PTSD, irrespective of trauma type, 5 this was not found in our study. Rather, we observed no substantial differences between men and women with similar trauma histories. Our findings frame MST as a distinctively detrimental stressor. The betweengender similarity of PTSD symptoms severity after MST is consistent with some of the existing literature among combatexposed OIF/OEF era Veterans. 3,13 Alternatively, another interpretation of our findings relates to a potential selection bias that is specific to assessment and treatment engagement. Specifically, if MST is associated with greater disclosure stigma, it may be the case that Veterans with this particular trauma type wait until they exceed a higher threshold of distress or symptom severity before they are willing to seek care. Together, these findings suggest that there may be unique characteristics of male and female service members (either before enrollment or within the context of the military) that prohibit the generalization of research findings on gender and trauma type to military samples. In several instances, our conclusions are similar to those described by Kimerling et al. 2 In a notable exception within the MST literature, they examined gender differences in mental health conditions among Veterans with and without reported MST. Their findings indicated that PTSD, alcohol disorders, and anxiety disorders were closely associated with MST for both genders, though the relationship was stronger for women. In contrast, bipolar, psychotic, and adjustment disorders are also more prevalent among populations endorsing histories of MST, and they are more significantly associated with men. Importantly, dissociative, eating, and depressive disorders, conditions traditionally linked to female gender in general population studies, were found at similar rates for both genders with MST histories.\nSimilarly, when examining gender differences associated with MST, symptom severity, and clinical morbidities, we observed these to be markedly similar for male and female Veterans. This is noteworthy as several of the mental health complaints assessed have often been gender associated in other research samples (i.e., depressive, dissociative, and substance use complaints). 40,41 Several factors may explain this observation. First, it may be the case that previously identified gender differences observed in trauma samples are more reflective of the types of trauma reported, such as increased reporting of sexual trauma experiences by women. An alternative explanation is that, if gender differences in these domains do exist, the buffering effects typically conferred by gender noted in other samples are diminished in the context of MST.\nRegarding the clinical utility of these findings, there is some evidence to suggest that women Veterans with comorbid PTSD and substance use problems are more frequently prescribed psychotropic medications that are inconsistent with VA Clinical Practice Guidelines. 42 Specifically, Bernardy et al. 43 reported that from 1999 to 2009, the rate for benzodiazepine prescription among VA utilizers diagnosed with PTSD was decreasing for men and increasing for women, even after controlling for other demographic characteristics and psychological comorbidities. Benzodiazepine utilization was higher for women with PTSD and substance use diagnoses, whereas the reverse was found for male Veterans. Irrespective of the etiology underlying the similar rates of substance use among male and female Veterans with histories of MST, clinical care providers are advised to thoroughly assess for substance use behaviors among women, be familiar with potential sex differences in pharmacokinetic responses and reproductive consequences of prescription use, and incorporate this critical information within care plans. Further research that avoids conflation of gender and trauma type is needed to clarify our findings and to confirm whether previous investigations related to gender differences in the context of PTSD generalize to those with histories of MST.\nThe present study also showed an increased risk for the diagnosis of thought disorders with male Veterans. This is consistent with research demonstrating increased risk for disorders such as schizophrenia in men, although this finding has been less well replicated in developed countries (see Aleman et al. 44 for a relevant meta-analytic review). We identified significant differences between gender and trauma type analyses, with occurrences of thought disorders predominantly observed among men endorsing MST. These results also mirror those observed by Kimerling et al. 2 in a sample of male and female VHA care utilizers with and without self-reported MST. However, we emphasize that this was a low base-rate condition, and our findings should be interpreted cautiously. Nonetheless, our results justify future research considerations, as the current lack of studies involving male survivors of MST may be obscuring an important clinical concern. If replicated, our results would suggest that longitudinal inquiry is needed to ascertain whether the risk of psychosis may be amplified by the experience of MST, whether prodromal or active symptoms of a thought disorder increase the likelihood of being sexually traumatized during the service, or whether other contextual factors may better explain this finding. Intervention research investigating treatment options for MST in the context of active or stabilized psychosis is similarly deficient. Further examination is warranted to replicate these preliminary findings and to establish the best practices for assessment and care.\nSeveral limitations of this study are notable. First, we were unable to fully examine the main and moderating effects of gender and trauma type due to the small number of women with combat exposure in our clinical sample. Given the increasing rates of women engaging in and exposed to direct combat, continued attention of post-trauma trajectories of MCT among women is needed. 9,45 Although the percentages of male and female Veterans with MST and MCT parallel the anticipated rates expected in a VA population, the difference in gender proportionality that is particularly noteworthy within the MCT group limits our ability to more conclusively rule out gender-related effects. Further, to more clearly evaluate trauma-type differences, our research did not attend to dual MST and MCT exposure, which appears to be associated with particularly deleterious clinical outcomes. 46,47 It should also be recognized that Veterans might be hesitant to report certain types of trauma, such as MST, during clinical interviews. As such, it is possible that our MCT group may include several Veterans with both MCT and MST exposure. Moreover, our research aims were descriptive in nature and were not designed to identify biopsychosocial mechanisms that were responsible for observed differences.\nDespite these disadvantages, our study yields several salient contributions to the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to directly examine clinical presentations based on both gender and trauma type in a single Veteran sample. Further, utilization of treatment-seeking participants, as in the present study, permits a better understanding of the clinical profiles that are likely to be encountered when Veterans present for mental healthcare, and it extends our knowledge on the clinical care needs of women Veterans and those exposed to MST. Awareness of similarities and divergences in clinical presentations may facilitate greater confidence in generalization of extant trauma research, when warranted, and concurrently assist in identifying areas in which differences may be clinically meaningful.\nSystem and the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry.

Little is known about how family planning clinics implement brief IPV/RC assessment interventions in practice. We describe the uptake and impact of a brief, trauma-informed, universal IPV/RC assessment and education intervention. Methods: Intervention implementation was evaluated via a mixed methods study among women ages 18 and up receiving care at one of two family planning clinics in greater Baltimore, MD. This mixed methods study entailed a quasi-experimental, single group pretest-posttest study with family planning clinic patients (baseline and exit survey n = 132; 3-month retention n = 68; retention rate = 52%), coupled with qualitative interviews with providers and patients (total n = 35). Results: Two thirds (65%) of women reported receiving at least one element of the intervention on their exit survey immediately following the clinic-visit. Patients reported that clinic-based IPV assessment is helpful, irrespective of IPV history. Relative to those who reported neither, participants who received either intervention element reported greater perceived caring from providers, confidence in provider response to abusive relationships, and knowledge of IPV-related resources at follow-up. Providers and patients alike described the educational card as a valuable tool. Participants described trade-offs of paper versus in-person, electronic medical record-facilitated screening, and patient reluctance to disclose current situations of abuse.In real-world family planning clinic settings, a brief assessment and support intervention was successful in communicating provider caring and increasing knowledge of violence-related resources, endpoints previously deemed valuable by IPV survivors. Results emphasize the merit of universal education in IPV/RC clinical interventions over seeking IPV disclosure.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I ntimate partner violence (IPV) affects an estimated one in three women in the United States, with significant implications for morbidity and mortality. [1][2][3][4][5] IPV impedes use of condoms and other forms of contraception, and increases risk for poor sexual and reproductive health, including unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection. 4,[6][7][8] In part, these patterns reflect compromised decision-making regarding, or limited ability to enact, contraceptive use 9,10 with partners sabotaging contraception and pressuring them to become pregnant, that is, reproductive coercion (RC). [11][12][13][14] Domestically and globally, the state of the science on IPVrelated prevention and intervention is rapidly advancing. 15,16 The health sector continues to serve a critical role in the response to violence 17 given both the prevalence and health impact of IPV. Screening and referral to support services is recommended by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 18 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 19 Institute of Medicine, 20 American Medical Association, 21 and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. 22 Clinicbased IPV screening efforts have yielded mixed evidence in decreasing IPV. 19,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Additional relevant endpoints identified by women and providers include IPV assessment as an opportunity to identify IPV survivors and provide education and links to services for all patients. 24,27,30 Asking about IPV in a sensitive, nonjudgmental way is often considered a successful and potentially therapeutic outcome in itself, because it represents the first step in caring for women who are or have experienced IPV. 24,27,30 These patient-identified endpoints are aligned with principles of trauma-informed care which include recognizing and responding to trauma, emphasizing safety, and providing opportunities to regain a sense of control and empowerment. 31 In practice, trauma-informed care routinely and universally inquires about violence and other trauma, and responds appropriately by providing support and linkage to care and access to justice, within an environment that is calm, safe, and empowering, and within a system that supports providers and collaborates with related services. 32 The Title X family planning clinics that provide services for over 4.5 million women annually 33 are important settings for IPV screening, support and connection to care, given the high prevalence of IPV among family planning clinic patients, 27,34,35 and its negative sexual and reproductive health impact. 4,12,36 One successful trauma-informed screening and intervention program in this setting, ARCHES (Addressing Reproductive Coercion in Health Settings), blends (1) universal education and assessment regarding IPV/RC; (2) harm reduction counseling; and (3) supported referrals to victim services (offered to all clients regardless of disclosure). 26,28 A palm-sized ''safety card'' brochure guides the conversation. The implementation of this approach within routine family planning care is designed to maximize sustainability and scalability while increasing awareness and use of support services as critical steps toward reductions in IPV and RC. In the initial randomized trial, among women who reported IPV at baseline, this approach reduced the odds of recent pregnancy coercion (a component of RC) at 4 month follow-up, and prompted some young women to terminate relationships for safety concerns. 28 A subsequent trial showed significant increases in knowledge of IPV related resources and selfefficacy to enact harm reduction behaviors, and among women with higher levels of recent RC exposure, a significant reduction in RC 1 year later. 26 Despite policy recommendations and evidence of efficacy, little is known about how IPV assessment interventions are implemented as recommended by ACOG and other professional organizations. It is critical to understand uptake, impact, and implementation considerations, such as use of electronic medical records (EMRs), to guide the IPV assessment and connection to care recommended as best practice. One valuable tool in bridging the gap between evidence-based policy and practice regarding IPV is implementation science, 29 which evaluates and monitors the translation of policy and evidence-based interventions into practice, and identifies facilitators and barriers in the process. 37 Project Connect, a multi-state demonstration initiative aimed to strengthen collaborations between the domestic violence, family planning, and reproductive health fields, affords a natural opportunity to understand the real-world implementation of ACOGs recommendations.

For women seeking family planning services, Project Connect aimed to improve safety and reproductive health through enhanced violence and RC screening, discussion of harm reduction strategies and referral to support services in family planning clinics. This sequential mixed-methods study evaluated the Maryland site Project Connect demonstration project as implemented in family planning programs in two locations in greater Baltimore, Maryland.

The intervention is delivered through: (1) a provider-facilitated discussion on IPV/RC and (2) the provision of a palm-sized safety card with information on IPV/RC, its health impact, and support resources. The safety card is designed for readability and interest with (1) magazine-style quizzes guiding readers to consider the health of their relationships including impact on sexual health, and potential fears for safety, (2) suggestions for harm reduction including female-controlled contraception, and (3) national resources for violence-related help-seeking with language normalizing their use. The health centers also partner formally with their local IPV victim service agencies to increase provider comfort with referring patients who disclose abuse. A day-long provider training led by national experts in trauma-informed care in reproductive health settings followed current guidelines for addressing IPV, reproductive and sexual coercion in family planning settings, with didactic training coupled with role-play and skill application. 39 While ''standard of care'' IPV assessment and support vary across clinical sites, IPV-related discussions, assessments and referrals are often left to the discretion of individual providers.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "958", "text": "DECKER ET AL.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Quantitative methodology", "text": "A quasi-experimental, single group pretest-posttest study, in which all participants were assigned to receive the intervention, was conducted to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, extent of implementation (i.e., intervention fidelity assessed via participant self-report of receipt of intervention), and effect on key outcomes.\nSample and recruitment. English-speaking women, ages 18-35, were recruited at two family planning health centers (urban vs. suburban) in the Baltimore area from January to April 2014. For feasibility considerations, patients were provided with recruitment flyers and given the option to initiate contact with the research team to confirm eligibility, discuss study procedures and conduct informed consent in private area of the health center. Patients completed baseline survey, attended their visit, and completed a brief exit survey where they provided contact information for scheduling 3-month follow-up, and received a $10 gift card and local resources for health and safety support. To aid in retention, participants also provided multiple forms of contact (e-mail, phone) for themselves as well as up to two alternate contacts. Surveys were administered via audio-computer assisted survey instrument and took *15-20 minutes. Similar procedures were used for follow-up data collection; participants received a $15 gift card at follow-up and some preferred to use an online survey tool. A total of 146 women were recruited at baseline across the two sites; 14 women without complete data for intervention receipt were excluded for a sample of n = 132. At 3-month follow-up, 68/132 (52%) were successfully retained. Retention was greater at the suburban health center relative to the urban site (63% vs. 33%) and among women ages 18-20, relative to the 26-30 years group (76% vs. 30%). No differences in loss to follow up were observed by nativity, relationship status, or history of IPV or RC.\nMeasures. The baseline survey assessed participants' demographic characteristics (age, nativity, relationship status), reason for clinic visit, recent sexual behavior, current contraceptive use, and lifetime history of trading sex for money, drugs or other resources. Lifetime and recent (past 3-months) physical and sexual IPV measures were from previous family planning clinic-based studies. 26,28,38 Missing data for IPV (n = 3) was conservatively imputed to not having experienced IPV. Lifetime and recent (past 3 months) experiences of RC were assessed using the standard 10-item measure, which has been used previously to evaluate ARCHES. 26,28,38 To ascertain knowledge and use of IPV resources, participants were asked whether they had heard of or used a list of several IPVrelated resources in the past 3 months.\nThe key indicator of intervention implementation, that is, intervention fidelity, is participant self-report of intervention receipt, as assessed on the exit survey, completed immediately after the clinical visit, via two items, ''Today, did your health care provider talk with you about healthy and unhealthy relationships?'' (discussion) and ''Today, did your health care provider give you a card called 'Do You Know Your Relationship Affects Your Health...?''' (safety card). Intervention acceptability was measured with five questions assessing helpfulness of provider-led discussions about healthy and unhealthy relationships, providers' investment in patient safety and ability to make appropriate IPV referrals, perceived safety as a patron of the clinic, and patients' likelihood to refer friends/family to the clinic (specified in Table 2). Women were also asked if their healthcare provider discussed RC and harm-reducing alternatives like intrauterine devices (IUDs). The follow-up survey was a shortened version of the baseline survey.\nAnalysis. IPV prevalence was calculated for the sample and by demographic, sexual risk behavior, and care-seeking characteristics. Differences were assessed using p-values derived from logistic regression analysis adjusted for clinic location. Self-reported intervention receipt, components thereof, and acceptability parameters were calculated overall and by IPV history; p-values were derived from logistic regression models adjusted for clinic location.

So then it's easier to talk about it. [Patient 011, age 18, Site B] Mandatory reporting and disclosing limits of confidentiality. Providers shared concerns about mandatory reporting considerations that come with patients disclosing IPV given that they may be related with potential instances of child abuse. Concerns included the lengthy reporting process, and a fear that ''patients feel like they were kind of betrayed because they came and talked about it, and now it has to be reported.'' Providers felt that mandatory reporting starts a process that often is ''not what the patients want'' and hence, patients find ''frustrating.'' Simultaneously, providers also reflected that informing patients of mandatory reporting procedures can deter patients from talking about their experiences.\nThey are told that, you know, we are a reporting agency, so depending on the abuse or coercion that sometimes it would have to be reported. That right there can just scare people from talking about it. And, um, sometimes there is some hesitation.\n[Provider 005, Site B]", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Results from this mixed-methods demonstration project evaluation illustrate that the universal provision of violence assessment and brief intervention recommended by ACOG 18 and other professional organizations [20][21][22] as well as the USPSTF 19 is acceptable to patients and providers alike. Trauma-informed discussion of healthy and unhealthy relationships is welcomed by patients affected by IPV and their unaffected counterparts. Those who receive violence-related discussion and/or safety resources felt more confident in their providers' concern for their safety and ability to respond appropriately to violence. Moreover, it increased knowledge of violence-related resources. These endpoints have been identified as highly relevant to violence survivors. 30 The high prevalence of lifetime IPV and RC in this patient population affirms the value of universal trauma-informed interventions that link patients with care.\nResults offer direction for implementing IPV and RC assessment in health centers. Patients described reluctance to disclose IPV before the situation is resolved, echoing past evidence of women's challenges and internal conflicts in disclosing IPV in health settings. 30 Thus, providing IPV-related information and support only in situations of IPV disclosure may risk missing those most in need. Rather, practices should emphasize provision of IPV-related information and support for all women to respect patient autonomy and sensitivities regarding IPV disclosure. Provider concerns over mandated reporting and its impact on patient-provider dynamics suggest the need for training and ongoing support to ensure provider confidence in communicating mandated reporting requirements. The safety card and emphasis on resource provision appeared to serve their role in giving providers what they have long asked for-clear and specific direction on how to respond briefly and effectively in cases of violence. Use of the safety card simultaneously facilitated the non-judgmental conversations that IPV survivors have requested. 30 As providers increasingly shift to computer facilitated records, patient advice documented herein on communicating connection and caring during discussion of sensitive topics such as IPV can guide protocols and provider training. Further implementation research should address clinic-level and provider-level factors that may influence provision of safety cards and IPV-related discussion as these factors may drive sustainability.\nFindings should be considered in light of several limitations. Intervention receipt was self-reported by participants and may be subject to error in recall, particularly for patients who had complicated clinic visits or were focused on other aspects of their discussion with providers. The extent to which recall could be differential by IPV status or other characteristics is unclear. Longer-term follow-up is needed to understand the durability of the changes in knowledge observed, and, importantly, their longer term impact on awareness and use of support services, as critical steps toward reducing IPV and RC, and mitigating their health impact. Our sample was limited to women ages 18 and over based on confidentiality considerations involved in recruiting minors, which represents a limitation given consistent evidence of IPV and RC among adolescent women. 1,41 Future implementation science research will benefit from inclusion of a wider age range, and stratified analysis by age. Retention at 3-month follow-up was low, despite retention efforts including timing of follow-up visits to roughly coincide with clinic follow-up appointments, as well as alternate contact points, and may reflect the relatively small remuneration for 3-month follow-up ($15). Attrition was nondifferential with respect to participant characteristics including violence history, and is thus anticipated to affect the efficiency of test results, but not internal validity. Generalizability may be limited as a function of our flyer-based recruitment strategy, which relied on patients to self-refer for participation and precluded calculation of response rate.\nOur study describes the real world implementation of clinical recommendations for brief screening and intervention for IPV and RC, and identifies recommendations to enhance successful implementation from the perspectives of patients and providers alike. The approach was beneficial and acceptable to providers and patients, including those affected by IPV and those not affected. Moreover, the clinical interactions were effective in communicating caring and imparting knowledge of violence support resources. Under randomized controlled trial conditions, the ARCHES intervention was found to enhance two outcomes on the path to safety, specifically knowledge of violence-related resources, and self-efficacy to enact harm reduction behaviors. 26 It reduced exposure to RC among those exposed most intensely, 26 though no reductions were observed in violence victimization. Further implementation research, with sufficient followup duration, is important to understand how health sector efforts to improve safety can improve women's health when taken to scale. Results should further encourage practitioners to integrate brief, trauma-informed IPV and RC assessment into practice, and motivate health systems to create and sustain the infrastructure necessary.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report", "journal": "National Center for Injury Prevention and Control", "year": "2011", "authors": "M C Black; K C Basile; M J Breiding"}, {"title": "Health consequences of intimate partner violence", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "2002", "authors": "J C Campbell"}, {"title": "Physical health consequences of physical and psychological intimate partner violence", "journal": "Arch Fam Med", "year": "2000", "authors": "A L Coker"}, {"title": "Intimate partner violence and physical health consequences", "journal": "Arch Intern Med", "year": "2002", "authors": "J Campbell; A S Jones; J Dienemann"}, {"title": "World report on violence and health", "journal": "Geneva: World Health Organization", "year": "2002", "authors": "L Heise; C Garcia-Moreno"}, {"title": "Dating violence and sexually transmitted disease/HIV testing and diagnosis among adolescent females", "journal": "Pediatrics", "year": "2005", "authors": "M R Decker; J G Silverman; A Raj"}, {"title": "Dating violence against adolescent girls and associated substance use, unhealthy weight control, sexual risk behavior, pregnancy, and suicidality", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2001", "authors": "J G Silverman"}, {"title": "Pregnancy coercion, intimate partner violence and unintended pregnancy", "journal": "Contraception", "year": "2010", "authors": "E Miller; M R Decker; H L Mccauley"}, {"title": "Partner influences and gender-related factors associated with noncondom use among young adult African American women", "journal": "Am J Community Psychol", "year": "1998", "authors": "G M Wingood; R J Diclemente"}, {"title": "Power over parity: Intimate partner violence and issues of fertility control", "journal": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "year": "2009", "authors": "R E Gee; N Mitra; F Wan; D E Chavkin; J A Long"}, {"title": "Coercive forms of sexual risk and associated violence perpetrated by male partners of female adolescents", "journal": "Perspect Sex Reprod Health", "year": "2011", "authors": "J G Silverman; H L Mccauley; M R Decker; E Miller; E Reed; A Raj"}, {"title": "Abusive experiences and young women's sexual health outcomes: Is condom negotiation self-efficacy a mediator?", "journal": "Perspect Sex Reprod Health", "year": "", "authors": "K A Jones; M D Cornelius; J G Silverman"}, {"title": "Male reproductive control of women who have experienced intimate partner violence in the United States", "journal": "Soc Sci Med", "year": "2010", "authors": "A M Moore; L Frohwirth; E Miller"}, {"title": "Intimate partner violence and other partner-related factors: Correlates of sexually transmissible infections and risky sexual behaviours among young adult African American women", "journal": "Sex Health", "year": "", "authors": "P Seth; J L Raiford; L S Robinson; G M Wingood; R J Diclemente"}, {"title": "Prevention of violence against women and girls: What does the evidence say?", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "2015", "authors": "M Ellsberg; D J Arango; M Morton"}, {"title": "Domestic violence enhanced perinatal home visits: The DOVE randomized clinical trial", "journal": "J Womens Health", "year": "2016", "authors": "P W Sharps; L F Bullock; J C Campbell"}, {"title": "Addressing violence against women: A call to action", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "2015", "authors": "C Garc\u00eda-Moreno; C Zimmerman; A Morris-Gehring"}, {"title": "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Mendes de Leon et al. screened middle-aged men in Holland and found that nonmarried, never married, and widowed had higher risk for coronary mortality (RR 2.2, 2.9, and 2.9, respectively) than married subjects. 4 Ebrahim et al. investigated the effect of MS on mortality among \u20217,000 middleaged British men. Single (never married) men had a higher risk of CV disease (CVD) mortality (RR = 1.5), but divorced/ separated men had not. Moreover, men who divorced during the follow-up period were at increased risk of CVD mortality (RR = 1.9), whereas those who became widowed were not. 5 In a large Japanese study on \u202194,000 patients, never married W showed a smaller but significant increased risk of mortality for all causes. As for risk of mortality for CVD, never married men compared with married men showed an increased risk of mortality from CVD. Divorced and widowed women showed moderately increased risks of mortality from CVD, compared with married women. 6 In a Scottish study, the risk of CV mortality was greatest in single never married men and separated/divorced women compared with those that were married in gender stratified models. 7 In particular, behavioral factors had a particular relevance for the relationship between being separated/ divorced and CV mortality in both men and women. 7 Even in particular subgroups of patients, such as those in hemodialysis, patients who were single and those who were divorced/widowed patients had higher risk than married patients for mortality from CVD. 8 In a US study on 10-year coronary heart disease incidence and mortality, even after adjusting for classical risk factors, married men were almost half as likely to die during follow-up compared with the unmarried. 9 AMI, ACS, and CAD. Acute myocardial infarction. A study conducted in the United States, in the early '80 s, reported an adjusted inhospital case fatality rate for AMI of 19.7% and 26.7%, respectively, for married and unmarried males. 10 Si-milar findings were confirmed also for married and unmarried females (23.3% and 37.4%, respectively). A 10-year followup of subjects discharged alive also confirmed a better survival rate for married compared with unmarried males and females. 10 More recently, in a Spanish study the condition of widow, compared with married, was independently associated with higher all-cause death (HR = 1.29) in contrast to single (HR = 1.04) and divorced (HR = 0.84), and gender did not show interaction with MS. 11 In Germany, overall MS showed an insignificant protective HR of 0.76. However, stratified analyses revealed strong protective effects only among men and women aged <60 years and diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Interestingly, the same protective effect (HR = 0.52) was confirmed also for subjects with cohabitation status. 12 Acute coronary syndrome. In a national cohort study in the United Kingdom, Cox analysis comparison of MS and mortality showed lower mortality rates for married (OR = 0.863), widowed (OR = 0.959), and unmarried (OR = 0.973) compared with single patients. 13 Moreover, divorced patients had significantly [ mortality rate compared to single patients (OR = 1.068). 13 Two Greek studies focused on ACS, with very similar results. Panagiotakos et al. found that never married patients had 2.8 times and 2.7 times higher risk of dying during hospitalization and during the first 30 days following hospitalization, respectively, compared with married patients. 14 Notara et al. reported that married patients had approximately 1/3 lower risk of ACS mortality compared with single, widowed, or divorced patients. 15 Results from a large study conducted in Middle East countries found that MS was an independent predictor for inhospital mortality and, in particular, widowed MS was associated with worse CV risk profile and both inhospital and 1-year outcome. 16 Also in Sweden, unmarried status in men, but not in women, was significantly associated with increased risk of suffering a coronary event (HR 1.10, 1.42, and 1.77 for never married, divorced, and widowed, respectively). Moreover, unmarried status was also related with an increased case fatality rate (1st day) in both men and women (M: OR = 2.14, 1.91, 1,49; W: 2.32, 1.87, 1.87, for never married, divorced, and widowed, respectively). 17 In a large study in the United Kingdom on \u2021700,000 women, those who were married or living with a partner had a similar risk of a first ischemic heart disease event as women who were not (RR = 0.99), but a significantly lower risk of mortality (RR = 0.72). 18 Dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and heart transplantation. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, the cumulative survival at 12 and 24 months was, respectively, 54.6% and 48.5% in widowed patients, 75.8% and 59.0% among single patients, and 80.0% and 71.2% among married patients. MS was a statistically significant independent predictor of survival, with single patients having a poorer survival than those who were married (RR = 2.5). 19 As for heart failure (HF), married patients experienced longer event-free survival than unmarried ones. 20,21 However, when medication adherence entered in the model, MS was not a significant predictor of event-free survival, demonstrating a strong mediation effect on the relationship of MS to survival. 21 Once again, also in subjects with heart transplantation, it was reported a significantly improved 1-year and 5-year survival ( p < 0.05 and 0.02, respectively) for married patients compared with unmarried patients. 22 Risk and outcome. Results from a cohort of \u20212,000 subjects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed that cases were more likely to be unmarried than the controls (30.2% vs. 21.0%), defined as being separated or divorced, single or widowed. Unmarried participants had a higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest (OR = 1.53). 23 As for clinical outcome of patients survived to an inhospital cardiac arrest, females, especially those without a living spouse, had worse neurological outcomes than males. 24 A Chinese study showed that also after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), psychosocial factors, lifestyle, and other risk factors, the OR for AMI associated with being single was 1.51 overall (1.19 in men and 2.00 in women, respectively). 25 MS has been found to impact also on outcome of PCI, both urgent and elective. Compared with unmarried, married patients exhibited a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking and a higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and family history of CAD. Married patients, compared with unmarried, had significantly reduced early and late major adverse cardiac event rates up to 1 year (13.3% vs. 8.2%, p > 0.01). In multivariate analysis, MS was independently associated with improved outcome (HR = 0.7). 26 As for HF, the results from a small US study found that MS was not a significant variable for inhospital death (HR = 0.71) or for time to readmission for HF (1.16). 27 ", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CV risk factors", "text": "Smoking. In large Korean population, smoking rates were higher for unmarried subjects compared with their married ones. The gap in smoking rates between unmarried and married women was much greater than between unmarried and married men. 28 The results showed that MS had a stronger protective influence on smoking in women than men, contrary to the gender pattern previously reported in western countries. The authors hypothesized that these findings could be explained by cultural tradition discouraging married women from smoking, but liberating divorced women. 28 In Sweden, never married and divorced subjects showed a significantly higher prevalence of daily smoking than married/cohabitating respondents 29 and, in Finland, living without a spouse was associated with daily smoking and higher nicotine dependence. 30 Obesity. In a sample of workers in Sweden, obesity was associated with an increased incidence of coronary events and deaths in all diverse occupational groups. However, being single significantly increased the CV risk associated with obesity. The multivariate adjusted RR of coronary events and deaths was, respectively, 1.91 and 2.54 (manual workers) and 4.79 and 3.80 (self-employed workers) compared with those who were cohabitants. 31 In contrast, in Greece, a higher risk of obesity was found in married men (OR = 2.28) and women (OR = 2.31) than in unmarried subjects. 32 Hypertension. A different blood pressure (BP) pattern has also been related to MS. Married subjects showed greater odds of dipping (OR = 2.26) compared with unmarried ones. Moreover, married subjects had a lower nighttime systolic BP (-2.4 mmHg), more pronounced in men than in women (-3.1 mmHg and 1.7 mmHg, respectively). 33 Moreover, single/divorced subjects had greater odds of being unaware and uncontrolled BP levels than married subjects. 34 Miscellanea. A Japanese study compared lifestyle and risk factors between men who were married and those who had never married. 35 Never married men were more likely to skip breakfast, had higher smoking rates, average values of diastolic BP, serum total cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose. The proportion of participants with three or more risk factors, that is, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia, was higher in the never married as well. 35 Dietary habits. In a study performed in Hong Kong, single women had lower consumption of vegetables and fish compared with married women. Single men had a better CV risk factor profile, including diastolic BP, triglycerides, and cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, and lower BMI. 36 Physical activity and fitness. MS represents important determinant for physical activity participation among older adults. Compared with single counterparts, married men reported higher median levels of exercise participation and married women reported higher levels of total activity. 37 In a sample of >8,000 US subjects, the transitions to being married (from single to married or from divorced to remarried) were associated with a modest reduction, while divorce was associated with a modest increase in fitness levels in men. 38 Health behavior. The results of a study on >120,000 US subjects showed that, regardless of any population subgroup or health indicator, married adults were generally found to be healthier than adults in other MS categories. MS differences in health were found in each of the three age groups studied (18-44, 45-64, and 65 years and over), but were most striking among adults aged 18-44 years. 39 The one negative health indicator for which married adults had a higher prevalence was overweight or obesity. Married adults, particularly men, had high rates of overweight or obesity relative to adults in other MS groups across most population subgroups studied. Never married adults were among the least likely to be overweight or obese. 40 In a Korean population of middleaged adults, the association between MS and health behaviors differed by sex, and it was observed that subjects living with partners were more likely to have healthier behavior than living without a partner. In particular, men living without a partner had lower odds of undergoing health screening and having regular breakfast, whereas women living without a partner had higher risk of smoking and alcohol consumption. 40 The possible relationship between MS and mortality from various causes has been the object of many studies. In a large US series of >280,000 subjects, as for the group of people aged 45-64 years, nonmarried subjects showed a statistically significant higher risk of mortality for various causes compared with married counterparts. 41 Younger age groups showed higher RR than older age groups, and the higher risk in nonmarried was comparable for both females and males. 41 In a cohort of British women, being single was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR = 1.45), whereas being divorced or widowed showed no excess mortality risk. 42 More recently, also in a Chinese population (approximately 50,000 subjects), unmarried and widowed women had an increased all-cause mortality risk (+11% and +10%, respectively), but never married women showed the greatest excess (+46%).\nAs for mortality for CV disease, divorce and not being married were associated with elevated risk (+47% and +65%, respectively) in men. 43 Other European studies confirmed these findings as well. In a wide population study in Norway (>800,000 subjects), divorced, never married, and widowed subjects (with respective decreasing odds) had significantly higher mortality for most causes of death compared with married ones. Among the nonmarried subjects, the excess mortality among the nonmarried was higher for men than for women. 44 A study conducted in Switzerland, on nearly 2.5 million subjects, aimed to estimate all-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR) for living arrangements and MS. 47 After stratification by living arrangement, mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced and single (HR 1.72 and 1.67, respectively) men who lived alone. In women of the same group by age, the highest risk was present in single and in those living with a partner (HR 1.70 for both). 45 Eating habits may represent a critical factor to health, and MS may have an influence. In their study on 1,514 men and 1,528 women in Greece, classified as never married, married, divorced, and widowed, Yannakoulia et al. found different dietary patterns in different subgroups, associated with BMI and total serum cholesterol. 46 In particular, never married participants showed a preferred consumption of potatoes and red meat, married participants of nuts, legumes, and fish, divorced participants of fruits, cereals, and soft drinks, whereas widowed participants preferred dairy, vegetables, sweets, and poultry. 46 Differences by gender may also exist in eating habits. The results from an important longitudinal study on middle-aged and older adults in United Kingdom showed that unhealthy changes to diet, evaluated with the four indicators of healthy eating, for example, fruit quantity and variety and vegetable quantity and variety, that accompanied divorce, separation, and becoming widowed were more common among men than women. 47 The prevalence, severity, associations, and response to treatment of several emerging CV risk factors, such as inflammatory markers, may also differ between men and women, 48 and inflammatory markers can be considered as a predictor of CV risk in women, 49 but it is not established whether MS may have some effect. A previous Swedish study was conducted on more than 6,000 apparently healthy men, measured for a series of five inflammation-sensitive proteins (fibrinogen, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, alpha1antitrypsin, and orosomucoid) and followed-up over 18 years. 50 All these proteins had higher concentrations in divorced men, and also after adjustment for traditional CV risk factors, divorced men showed a higher incidence of coronary events. 50 Very recently, a study conducted in Singapore evaluated the prospective influence of MS and, among other variables, C-reactive protein (CRP) on the mortality of a cohort of 220 patients with chronic HF. 51 After adjustments for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, age, and gender, being unmarried and higher CRP predicted mortality (OR = 2.80 and OR = 1.92, respectively). In the combined multivariate model, MS (OR = 2.20), CRP (OR = 1.91), and NYHA class (OR = 2.41) independently predicted mortality. 51 Interestingly, men remaining married in late adulthood exhibited higher protection against elevated levels of CRP. 52 Mood may contribute to poor metabolic control. It has been recently reported that women, who had higher prevalence of depression than men, showed also significant associations with metabolic risk factors, for example, high fasting blood glucose and high glycohemoglobin. 53 Alcohol consumption and MS deserve some considerations apart. Previous evidence is available showing that MS and marital disruption, that is, marital separation, divorce, are associated with a wide range of poor mental and physical health outcomes, including increased risk for all-cause mortality.\nMarital disruption and alcohol consumption are tightly connected. On one hand, living alone is associated with an increased risk of alcohol-related mortality, irrespective of gender socioeconomic status or the specific cause of death. 54 On the other, the level of alcohol use is an important predictor of marital dissolution. In fact, heavy drinking among men and women increased the risk of future marital dissolution (HR = 1.39 and 1.41, respectively). The HR for divorce was 1.51 when only the husband was a heavy drinker, while it was 3.07 when only the wife was a heavy drinker. 55 ", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MARITAL STATUS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The present study, collecting the available evidence, seems to confirm the importance of MS also for CV diseases and CV risk factors. Most studies showed better outcomes for married persons, and men who were single generally had the poorest results. It is possible that persons who are married may have lower mortality because of protective effects of marriage or even selection of healthy individuals into marriage. It is likely that people who have a spouse may exhibit higher compliance with medical controls, medications, and screening programs. For example, a study conducted in the Unites States on 36,594 adults showed that being unmarried was associated with lower odds of cholesterol screening for both genders. In particular, the widowed status was associated with the lowest likelihood of screening, with quite similar odds for men (OR = 0.56) and women (OR = 0.53). 56 Again, the attendance at outpatients cardiac rehabilitation programs was significantly higher for married/partnered subjects (OR = 1.72). 57 MS could be associated also with biological, behavioral, and also psychological factors.\nMany factors could be related, in general, to being married versus loneliness: healthier meals, better sleep, less stress, financial benefits, and better mood. The single individuals who never married deserve further studies on their right as they are a self-selected group likely with their own special needs. Again, single by their choice or persons who did not find a partner to live with are the same thing? Moreover, we do not have information enough on whether the apparently protective effects of marriage are extended also in the case of same-sex spouses or partners in civil union. The recent authorization of these practices should allow more information also in these cases.\nMuch work is still to be done to understand the real, probably multifactorial, reasons of the connections before marriage on health and to provide convincing evidence of direct cause-effect relationships. And the topic of quality of marriage opens up another series of questions. 58 At present, we do not have enough to draw definite conclusions about recommending specific policies or program interventions.

To address gaps in this research, we examined associations among body composition, endometriosis, and physical activity. Materials and Methods: Women from 14 clinical sites in the Salt Lake City, Utah and San Francisco, California areas and scheduled for laparoscopy/laparotomy were recruited during 2007-2009. Participants (N = 473) underwent standardized anthropometric assessments to estimate body composition before surgery. Using a cross-sectional design, odds of an endometriosis diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for anthropometric and body composition measures (weight in kg; height in cm; mid upper arm, waist, hip, and chest circumferences in cm; subscapular, suprailiac, and triceps skinfold thicknesses in mm; arm muscle and fat areas in cm 2 ; centripetal fat, chest-to-waist, chest-to-hip, waist-to-hip, and waist-toheight ratios; arm fat index; and BMI in kg/m 2 ). Physical activity (metabolic equivalent of task-minutes/week) and sedentariness (average minutes sitting on a weekday) were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Measures were modeled continuously and in quartiles based on sample estimates. Adjusted models were controlled for age (years, continuous), site (Utah/California), smoking history (never, former, or current smoker), and income (below, within 180%, and above of the poverty line).

Women in the highest versus lowest quartile had lower adjusted odds of an endometriosis diagnosis for: weight; mid-upper arm, hip, and waist circumferences; total upper arm and upper arm muscle areas; BMI; and centripetal fat ratio.

[5][6][7][8] These equivocal findings may be a function of varying study populations, diagnostic approaches for endometriosis, or measurement techniques for body composition. 1,[9][10][11][12] Researchers have questioned whether body composition as indicated by BMI has an etiologic role or is a reflection of other factors that may be associated with the development of endometriosis, such as physical activity, parity, or cigarette smoking. 7,11,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19] Nevertheless, BMI has been associated with gynecological functioning. Underweight young adult women are at increased risk for menstrual dysfunction relative to normal weight women 20 while women who are overweight are at increased risk for various gynecological disorders, including menstrual dysfunction 20 and impaired fecundity. 21 Despite its near universal acceptance as a proxy for body composition (i.e., level of adiposity), BMI does not directly measure body composition, especially the amount and distribution of adipose and muscle tissue. Tissue type in the context of obesity is important to distinguish; the biological activity of adipose and muscle tissue depends on the amount, distribution, 22 and type of muscle fiber, which differs based on amount of adipose tissue. 23 A more accurate measurement of body composition to distinguish between adipose tissue and muscle mass requires anthropometric or other more specialized assessments (e.g., dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA], bioelectric impedance, or hydrostatic weighing). 24 Anthropometry and some types of specialized assessments, such as DXA, may also capture the location and regional distribution of adipose tissue, 25 which may be informative about the pathophysiology of endometriosis.\nIn addition, much of the research on the relationship between BMI and endometriosis has not considered physical activity, although such activity has been associated with endometriosis in some 11,13,14,19 but not all studies. 26,27 In addition, physical activity and BMI have associated in a bidirectional relationship. 28 However, the relationships among physical activity, BMI, and disease are unclear. 29 To address the gaps in current research regarding body habitus and endometriosis, we assessed the relationship between anthropometric body composition indicators and a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. We used anthropometric measures, body composition indicators, and body fat distribution ratios.

Next, staff performed standardized anthropometric assessments with a protocol, 25 as illustrated in Figure 1a. The following measurements were taken using calibrated and certified equipment: height (centimeters; cm) using a fixed stadiometer (214 Road Rod portable stadiometer [seca Corporation, Hamburg, Germany; US office, Hanover, MD] or the wooden Shorr Board [Shorr Productions, Olney, MD]); weight (kilograms; kg) using a balance scale; triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (millimeters; mm) using a Lange Skinfold Caliper (Beta Technology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and mid-upper arm, waist, and hip body circumferences (cm) using tape measures. Chest circumference (cm) was estimated from self-reported bra size using well-established algorithms. 30 Bra size was used instead of directly measuring chest size to (a) decrease women's discomfort that could arise when measuring around the chest and (b) address variability in the possible position of breasts on the chest. Waist circumference measurements were taken at the natural indentation of the waist. 25 To maximize reliability, all measurements were taken twice. If the first two measurements differed by \u20210.5 cm for height, \u20210.1 kg for weight, \u20214 mm for any skinfold thickness, or \u20210.5 cm for body circumferences, then a third measurement was taken.\nAnthropometric measurements were averaged for analysis and then converted to various indicators of muscularity and adiposity (described below), called body composition indicators hereon in this article. [31][32][33] Body circumferences were used to derive ratios indicating body fat distribution. Body composition indicators and body fat distribution ratios are illustrated in Figure 1b. Formulas used to derive body composition indicators are as follows: arm fat index = (upper arm fat area/total upper arm area) \u2022 100; BMI = weight (kg)/ height (m) 2 ; total upper arm area = mid upper arm circumference (cm) 2 /(4 \u2022 p); upper arm fat area = total upper arm areaupper arm muscle area; upper arm muscle area = ([mid upper arm circumference(cm)] -[(triceps skinfold thickness[cm]) \u2022 p] 2 )/(4 \u2022 p).

Women completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) to assess degree of physical activity and inactivity. 35 The IPAQ-SF captures physical activity as frequency (days), duration (hours and minutes), and intensity of physical activity, which were used to compute metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes of weekly physical activity (continuous). Importantly, the IPAQ enabled us to assess inactivity as frequency (days) and duration (hours and minutes) sitting on a weekday (continuous) to assess sedentariness. 28,35 Finally, women provided serum samples to assess serum cotinine (ng/mL) as a biomarker of current nicotine exposure; this measure can differentiate active from either passive or no cigarette smoking.

Findings were similar across standardized continuous measures and measures in quartiles. Although previous researchers have reported an inverse association between BMI and endometriosis, our study is the first to suggest that being lean in adipose tissue and muscle mass are associated with greater odds of an endometriosis diagnosis. Our findings are strengthened by our assessment of body composition with standardized anthropometric measures and our definition of endometriosis using the United States gold standard of surgical visualization.\nUsing data from a study that had an exposure cohort design, we found that women without endometriosis had greater adiposity and upper arm muscle mass than women with the disease. Our findings corroborate earlier findings of inverse associations between body compositions as measured by BMI 7 or selfmeasured waist-to-hip ratio 53 and endometriosis as measured via surgical visualization or self-reported physician diagnosed, respectively. In addition, in adjusted models, we found an absence of a relationship between waist-to-hip ratio and endometriosis diagnosis; these findings are similar to those in a study that included friend controls and an operative sample. 54 Our novel research suggests that a more nuanced understanding of body composition-adipose tissue amount and distribution, as well as muscle mass-might help characterize gynecologic disease risk, as opposed to simpler and more Continuous variables are standardized (variables divided by their respective standard deviation.

Many researchers who study obesity use BMI as a measure, including in the context of gynecologic disease. For example, low BMI appears to be protective against ovarian cancer in premenopausal women. 55 However, we found that low adiposity was associated with disease: women with endometriosis were more likely to be lean than women without endometriosis. Interestingly, women with endometriosis have the same or greater risk for ovarian cancer than women without endometriosis. [56][57][58] We suggest that future researchers could advance understanding of relationships between obesity and gynecologic disease by looking more precisely at body composition rather than BMI alone. In our study, low BMI was associated with increased odds of an endometriosis diagnosis. When considering estimates for body composition, adiposity measures were not only inversely associated with endometriosis but also with muscle mass. Thus, by looking at estimates of both adipose tissue and muscle mass, we provide a more comprehensive understand-\ning of what tissue types may contribute to the increased odds of an endometriosis diagnosis. By studying body composition, researchers and healthcare providers may gain understanding of disease mechanisms. Questions for future research include: why is leanness not protective in endometriosis whereas it is in other gynecologic diseases? How can clinicians assess patients for endometriosis risk more effectively? To date, there are no known biomarkers or noninvasive diagnostic methods of incident endometriosis suitable for population research or clinical care. [59][60][61][62] Body composition provides another means for researchers to investigate potential involvement of an altered adipose tissue milieu in endometriosis characterized by a different immunological profile [63][64][65][66] or omental fat protease expression.

Incorporating body composition into clinical decision-making could be helpful given that no screening tools exist and the only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis is via surgery.\nDespite the study's many strengths, careful interpretation of the findings is needed relative to important study limitations, most notably its cross-sectional analysis. The natural history of endometriosis is unknown; it is possible that body habitus, physical activity, and sedentariness in childhood and/or adolescence are important to the development of endometriosis, 11 consistent with a possible in utero origin for endometriosis. 72,73 In addition, while measurements were taken about 2 months before surgery, women were unaware of their postoperative diagnoses at the time of measurement. This is an important consideration for self-reported data, including bra size, given the potential for reporting errors. 74 Another key limitation is reliance on a clinical population comprising women who sought care and underwent surgery. The extent to which the findings are upheld at the population level remain to be established, particularly because 11%, or more, of women may have unrecognized disease. 1 As is the case with observational research in general, we recognize the potential for residual confounding.

We aimed to examine the associations between moderate-severe VMS and moderatesevere depressive symptoms. Methods: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 2,020 noninstitutionalized Australian women aged 40-65 randomly recruited between October 2013 and March 2014. Symptoms were assessed by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, with score \u202120 defined as moderatesevere depressive symptoms. Cigarette, alcohol, and psychotropic medication use was also assessed. Binge drinking was defined as four standard drinks on one occasion. Results: VMS were classified as moderate-severe for 267 of the 2,020 women (13.3%). After adjusting for multiple factors, including age, partnership status, paid employment, housing insecurity, and body mass index, when compared to women with no or mild VMS, women with moderate-severe VMS were more likely to have moderate-severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.80, confidence interval [95% CI], 2.01-3.88, p < 0.001). Having moderate-severe depressive symptoms was associated with a greater likelihood of use of psychotropic medications (48.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "S ignificant controversy exists regarding the association between menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and mood. Previous studies have largely focused on menopausal stage, with consistent evidence that women are more prone to depressive symptoms during the perimenopause and early postmenopause. [1][2][3][4][5][6] VMS too, are most likely to occur during perimenopause and early postmenopause. 7,8 However, most studies that have examined the association of VMS and depressive symptoms have not used validated measures to assess VMS, or have examined only the presence of ''any'' VMS rather than truly bothersome VMS. 2,5,[9][10][11] Furthermore, most studies have utilized low cutoff scores for depressive symptoms, making it difficult to determine whe-ther VMS are associated with clinically relevant depressive symptoms, [9][10][11][12][13] and other studies have also been limited by convenience sampling or small sample size. [14][15][16] The present study was therefore undertaken to determine the association between moderate-severe VMS and moderatesevere depressive symptoms, using validated questionnaires in a randomly recruited, appropriately sized community sample. The rationale for assessing the association between depressive symptoms and VMS, rather than menopausal status, is twofold. First, in clinical practice, it can be difficult to classify menopausal status, especially for the nonspecialist, whereas VMS are a distinct clinical manifestation of menopause. Second, while research has linked the early postmenopause with depressive symptoms, many women will continue to experience bothersome VMS for many years after the final menstrual period. 7,17 Methods", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study participants", "text": "The study has been reported according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. 18 Women were recruited from the Roy Morgan Single Source (RMSS) database, which contains over 300,000 respondents with 50,000 new participants each year. Recruitment to RMSS is based on the Australian electoral roll. Voting is compulsory in Australia, with all eligible adults' names and addresses registered on the roll. Australia's 150 electorates, each with *150,000 people, are divided into four roughly equal sections, creating 600 sampling areas. A starting address from each sampling area is randomly selected each month from a list of all known addresses. Face to face interviews are conducted to recruit people from these sampling points.\nFor the current study, community dwelling women aged 40-65, listed on the RMSS, were randomly recruited by telephone to a study of ''the health of women at midlife,'' as previously described. 19 Recruitment to the current study was deliberately designed so that the sample represented the age distribution of women within the target age group according to the 2011 Australian census. 20 The only exclusion criterion was being unable to complete a written questionnaire in English. Women interested in the study were sent the study questionnaire with a reply paid envelope, with return of a completed questionnaire accepted as informed consent. A total of 17,226 phone numbers on the RMSS database were dialed, resulting in 5,850 contacts (Fig. 1). Of 5,079 eligible women, 2,911 women were recruited with 2,051 questionnaires returned.

Based on validated cutpoints, women were classified as having as minimal-mild (<20) or moderate-severe ( \u202120) depressive symptoms. 21 The participants were classified as being premenopausal, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal on the basis of published algorithms that take into account age, menstrual bleeding pattern, gynecological history, and the use of systemic hormone therapy. 22,23 The degree of bother caused by menopausal symptoms was determined by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL), a validated self-report instrument. 24 The VMS domain of the MENQOL comprises three questions about the degree of bother caused by night sweats, hot flashes, and sweating. Participants rated each symptom from 1 (no symptom) to 8 (extremely bothersome). The VMS domain score was calculated as the mean score of these three questions. 24 We further divided the domain score into two levels: no or mildly bothersome symptoms (score 1-\u00a35) and moderate to severely bothersome symptoms (hereafter referred to as moderate-severe) if VMS were rated more than the midpoint of the scale (score >5-8). 19 We have successfully used this approach in multiple other publications. 7,19,25 Participants were asked if they were current smokers (yes/ no), whether they drank alcohol (yes/no), and the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption. Binge drinking was defined as consuming \u20214 standard alcoholic drinks on one occasion. 26 The study questionnaire also provided women with a comprehensive list of psychotropic medications. Participants were asked to identify any medication they had used in the last 4 weeks. The medications were classified as follows: antidepressants (paroxetine, mirtazapine, citalopram, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, agomelatine, and sertraline); anxiolytics (lorazepam, temazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, and alprazolam); antipsychotics (chlorpromazine, risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine); and mood stabilizers (lithium, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine). Mood stabilizers (other than lithium) were excluded if the woman had a current neurological disorder due to the possibility that the medication was being used to treat another condition, such as epilepsy. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was defined as use in the last 4 weeks of oral, transdermal, or implanted estrogen-only therapy, estrogen-progestin therapy, tibolone, the combined oral contraceptive pill, compounded estrogen, and compounded progesterone.\nWomen were asked if they felt their housing was financially secure, with those reporting ''no'' or ''uncertain'' classified as having insecure housing.

Although MHT use was not significant in the univariate analysis, given that MHT has the capacity to affect VMS and depressive symptoms, for completeness we ran a version of the model that also included MHT, however, the results were unchanged (results not shown).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Psychotropic medications, smoking, and alcohol consumption", "text": "Four hundred ninety-one women (24.3%) reported use of at least one psychotropic medication in the prior 4 weeks. Antidepressants were the most commonly used psychotropic (19.0%) followed by anxiolytics (4.1%), antipsychotics (1.6%), and mood stabilizers (0.9%, when antiepileptic medications taken by women with a neurological condition were excluded). Thirteen women (0.6%) reported using an antidepressant to treat VMS. Current smoking was reported by 282 women (14.0%) and 1,482 women (73.4%) reported consuming alcohol. Five hundred four women (25.0%) reported binge drinking, at least once per month, and 223 (11.0%) reported binge drinking at least once per week.\nWomen with moderate-severe depressive symptoms, compared to those with minimal-mild depressive symptoms, were more likely to use psychotropic medications (48.9%, 95% CI, 43.1-54.8 vs. 20.1%, 95% CI, 18.2-22.1, p < 0.001), smoke (25.9%, 95% CI, 20.8-30.9 vs. 12.2%, 95% CI, 10.6-13.7, p < 0.001), and binge drinking at least weekly (15.1%, 95% CI, 11.0-19.2 vs. 10.3% 95% CI, 8.8-11.7, p = 0.015).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This large study of randomly recruited, community-based women aged 40-65, clearly demonstrates that moderateseverely bothersome VMS are independently associated with moderate-severe depressive symptoms. The observed association was retained after controlling for age, BMI, partnership status, education, employment status, carer status, housing insecurity, and use of MHT.\nPrevious investigators have assessed the presence or frequency of VMS. 2,5,[9][10][11]30,31 However, the prevalence of any VMS in midlife women is very high, ranging between 42.1% and 74.2% of peri-and postmenopausal women in our cohort. 7 Such ubiquity of VMS renders it difficult to interpret associations in a meaningful way. Focusing on moderate-severe VMS is more clinically relevant, as these are the women more likely to present to their doctors.\nThis study also used a far higher threshold for depressive symptoms than prior studies. The cutoff used in the current study of BDI \u202120 selects women with moderate-severe symptoms. A study comparing the BDI to the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version, found a cutoff of \u202115 to have 65% sensitivity and 97% specificity for a current episode of major depression. 32 Many past studies have relied on the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and have classified women with a CES-D score of \u202116 as having depressive symptoms, 3,9,33 although such a score incorporates many women with mild symptoms or distress as opposed to depression. 34 A BDI score \u202120 is approximate to a CES-D score of \u202125. 35 The Harvard Study of Mood and Cycles found that a CES-D score >24 had a high sensitivity and specificity for major depressive disorder. 2 A study of community dwelling adults found a CES-D score \u202125 to have a high sensitivity and specificity for ''clinically relevant depression'' defined as major depressive disorder, dysthymia, or subthreshold depression compared to a clinical interview. 13 Thus, this study by using a higher threshold for depressive symptoms provides insights into women with clinically relevant symptomatology. By demonstrating an association between moderate-severe VMS and moderate-severe depressive symptoms, this study adds further weight to the notion of a shared etiology between VMS and depression. In addition to improving VMS, estrogen therapy may improve mood in early menopause. 36 The use of antidepressants by 20% of women in the study is consistent with results of a recent study of 111,705 Australians aged 45 years and older, in which 23% of women had been dispensed an antidepressant within the previous 19 months. 37 In a global context, antidepressant use in Australia is high, being second only to Iceland in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. 38 The other factors found to be independently associated with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms, namely morbid obesity and insecure housing, and older age being associated with a decreased likelihood, are noteworthy.\nThe major strength of this study is the representativeness of the community-based sample. Characteristics of Australian women aged 40-65 in the 2011 national census that are very similar to our sample include ethnicity (white, 92% vs. 93.9% in our sample), being partnered (70% vs. 67.2%), education beyond high school (56.8% vs. 58.7%), and being in paid employment (62.5% vs. 63.1%). 28 A potential study limitation is the reliance on self-report measures. However, the BDI is validated for epidemiological research. Other potential limitations were the inability to compare demographics of respondents and nonrespondents due to privacy guidelines and the reliance on women able to complete the questionnaire in English. This was unlikely to have a meaningful effect on outcomes as the rate of English literacy in Australian women exceeds 96%. 39 In conclusion, moderate-severe VMS are independently and significantly associated with moderate-severe depressive symptoms.

Sociocultural factors might play an important role among Hispanic women; however, very few studies have examined this association. Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine the associations between acculturation and maternal diet, physical activity, and PPWR. Design: This is a cross-sectional study of baseline data from 282 Hispanic women participating in the FitMoms/ Mam\u00e1s Activas study, a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of primarily an internet-based weight control program, in reducing PPWR among low-income women. We performed multivariable linear regression to examine the association of acculturation with diet quality, physical activity, and PPWR at study entry. Results: A total of 213 (76%) women had acculturation scores reflecting Mexican orientation or bicultural orientation, whereas 69 (24%) had scores that represented assimilation to Anglo culture. Women who were more acculturated had lower intakes of fruits and vegetables, lower HEI scores, and lower physical activity levels than women who were less acculturated ( p < 0.05). We found an association between acculturation and PPWR in that for every 1-unit increase in acculturation score, PPWR increased, on average, by 0.80 kg.

For instance, the prevalence of high PPWR ranges from 40%-60% among low-income Hispanic women. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] Therefore, understanding factors that affect high PPWR among lowincome Hispanic women is critical to reducing obesity health disparities.\nHispanic immigrants tend to have better health upon arrival to the U.S. compared with U.S.-born individuals; however, this health advantage appears to diminish over time. [14][15][16] In fact, the rates of many health outcomes for Hispanic immigrants converge to the rates of U.S.-born individuals as the beliefs and practices of U.S. culture are adopted. 17 This process, known as acculturation, is multidimensional and influences lifestyle behaviors, such as diet, physical activity, and obesity, 18,19 and might contribute to increased PPWR among Hispanic women.\nEpidemiologic research suggests that greater acculturation, based on proxy measures, including place of birth, generation status in the U.S., and duration of residency in the U.S., is associated with higher weight gain during pregnancy. [20][21][22] However, to our knowledge, only one study has directly assessed the association between acculturation and PPWR among Hispanic women and no association was found. 20 Previous research is limited by the use of single proxy indicators to measure acculturation and lack of validated measures of diet and physical activity. Hispanic practices differ across Hispanic ethnic groups making generalizations across heterogeneous Hispanic populations difficult. Therefore, the objective of our study was to expand upon the limited evidence by examining the association between acculturation and PPWR among Hispanic postpartum women primarily of Mexican descent using an improved, multidimensional acculturation scale and objective measures of diet and exercise. Because acculturation is associated with lifestyle factors (e.g., diet and physical activity), we will also explore the mediating role of postpartum diet and physical activity on the association between acculturation and PPWR.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design and population", "text": "We utilized baseline data from FitMoms/Mam\u00e1s Activas, a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of primarily an internet-based weight control program, in reducing PPWR in low-income women participating in Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Nutrition Program. 23 Participants were women recruited from 12 WIC clinics in California (six in Santa Barbara county, four in San Luis Obispo county, and two in Ventura county) between 2013 and 2015 (n = 371).

Participants completed a questionnaire at study entry assessing age, race, ethnicity, nativity, duration of U.S. residency, parity, income, education, food insecurity, breastfeeding, and smoking status.\nAcculturation. Acculturation was measured using the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-Version II (ARMSA-II), which assesses an individual's preference for Spanish or English media and contact with their country of origin and people of Latino and Anglo backgrounds using multiple domains of behaviors, identity, and interpersonal relationships. 25 The ARSMA-II can be scored by calculating the difference between the mean of the non-Hispanic White American Oriented Scale of the ARSMA-II and the mean of the Mexican Oriented Scale of the ARMSA-II (range: -4 to 4; mean -SD of 0.12 -2.53). The scores are then converted into five levels of acculturation ranging from 1 to 5 (5 representing most acculturated to Anglo-American orientation). 25 Anthropometric measures. PPWR was calculated as the difference between maternal weight at study entry and prepregnancy weight. Weight at study entry was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated standard digital scale. Two measures are completed with participants weighed in light clothing (without shoes). Standing height was measured twice in patients without shoes in millimeters with a wallmounted Harpenden stadiometer at WIC clinics. Prepregnancy weight was based on self-report at the time of last menstrual period. 26,27 Total gestational weight gain (GWG) was also selfreported by study participants.\nDietary intake and physical activity. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls on 2 random days over a week [28][29][30] and completed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Automated Self-Administered 24-hour recall (ASA-24; http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24.html). We excluded women with daily energy intakes below the 1st or above the 99th percentiles (672 and 4306 kcals) to account for implausible energy intakes (n = 7).\nThe 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) was used to assess postpartum diet quality, which is comprised of 12 components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, fatty acids, refined grains, sodium, and empty calories). Component scores were calculated directly from the ASA24 data files using the HEI SAS macro provided by NCI (http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/tools.html#sas). Briefly, each component score was derived by summing the foods from the component. Servings were converted to the appropriate unit of measurement for computing HEI-2010 scores. Each food component, other than fatty acids, was assessed per 1,000 kilocalories (kcals) with empty calories assessed as a percent of total kcals. 31 The scores for each of the 12 components are summed to yield a score ranging between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate higher diet quality.\nThe ActiGraph GT3X+ (The ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) accelerometer was used to measure maternal physical activity. The monitor samples time-varying accelerations ranging from -6 g's at a user-defined rate. The monitors (firmware v2.4.0) were initialized to sample triaxial acceleration at 40 Hz, and data were stored in flash memory on the device until it was downloaded to a computer. Data were initially processed using ActiLife software (v6.11.7). The proprietary software was used to filter the raw data using the lowfrequency filter and averaged over 1-second epochs. Data were then exported to comma-separated values files. The remaining processing was completed using a program written in SAS (v9.4 SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on their waist of their nondominant side for 5-7 days, and were allowed to take it off while sleeping. Wear time was determined using the Choi algorithm. 32 Accelerometer wear time was required to be \u202110 hours per day to be included in the analysis, and total minutes in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were calculated. 33 1334 MARTIN ET AL.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Because the primary focus of our study was the impact of assimilation to U.S. culture, we excluded women from our analysis who did not self-identify as Hispanic (n = 67) resulting in a final analytic sample size of 282. For descriptive purposes only, women were categorized into two groups based on their acculturation level: (1) very or strongly assimilated, defined as acculturation score >3; and (2) bicultural or less assimilated, defined as acculturation score \u00a33. This categorization is in line with the ARSMA-II scoring metric used to differentiate Mexican Americans who are either very or strongly assimilated to Anglo culture and Mexican Americans who are less assimilated or bicultural. 25 We compared selected baseline characteristics, dietary intake, physical activity, and pregnancy-related weight by acculturation using two-tailed chi-square tests for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nWe examined the extent to which acculturation (continuously) was associated with dietary intake (total energy intake and HEI-2010), physical activity (total minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA], total light minutes of physical activity, total minutes of sedentary behavior), and GWG using a separate linear regression model for each outcome. Potential confounders were identified a priori from the research literature and causal diagrams. 34 Our first model included main effects for acculturation and months postpartum at study entry only. Our second model adjusted for the main effects of months postpartum at study entry, maternal age at study entry, breastfeeding status, education level, parity, and total energy intake (with exception of energy intake model).\nTo examine the relation between acculturation and PPWR, three separate linear regression models were estimated. Model 1 assessed the association between acculturation and PPWR adjusting only for months postpartum at study entry. Model 2 included main effects for months postpartum at study entry, maternal age at study entry, education, breastfeeding, and parity. Model 3 included variables from model 2 in addition to main effects for prepregnancy BMI as well as the diet and physical activity variables that were significantly associated with acculturation.

We also found a positive association between acculturation and PPWR. Specifically, PPWR increased, on average, by 0.80 kg for every 1-unit increase in acculturation score.\nOur study adds to the limited body of research examining the association between acculturation and PPWR. Our findings are in contrast to a prior retrospective study, in which no association was found between language preference, a proxy measure of acculturation, and PPWR after adjusting for baseline BMI, age, and smoking status. 20 It is possible that language preference as a proxy measure has limited utility in capturing the complex process of acculturation by which immigrant populations adapt to and integrate into U.S. culture and society. Our study used the ARMSA-II scale to capture the multidimensionality of acculturation. The difference in assessment of acculturation might contribute to the conflicting results.\nOur findings that women with higher acculturation had higher PPWR is similar to studies of weight gain during pregnancy. 22,35,36 Hispanic women residing in a U.S.-Mexico border county, a measure of lower acculturation, had a lower risk of excess GWG than women residing in a nonborder county. 36 Hispanic women born in the U.S., a commonly used measure of acculturation, gained more weight during pregnancy than women born outside the U.S. 22,35 A recent study among Puerto Rican women in Massachusetts measured acculturation using the Psychological Acculturation Scale and measures of generation in the U.S., place of birth, and language preference. 22 They found that women with grandparents and at least one parent born in Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic gained, on average, 2.2 kg and 0.9 kg, respectively, more over the course of pregnancy than women who were born in Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic; however, no association was found using other acculturation measures. It is important to note that these studies were conducted in diverse Hispanic populations (e.g., Dominican Republican, Puerto Rican, Honduran), whereas our findings are from predominately Mexican American women who have distinct cultural practices. Despite these differences, our findings are consistent.\nWe also observed inverse associations of acculturation with diet and physical activity behaviors. Higher acculturation was associated with lower diet quality, as measured by the HEI-2010. Similar findings were reported previously in a comprehensive systematic review, which found that Hispanics with higher acculturation consumed more fast food, snacks, sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages and less fruit and beans than those who were less acculturated. 37 While we did not find an association between acculturation and levels of MVPA, statistically significant associations with light physical activity and sedentary time were observed. Higher levels of acculturation was associated with fewer minutes of light physical activity, which is in contrast to the widespread literature showing a positive relationship between acculturation and physical activity. 19 Moreover, higher acculturation was also associated with increased minutes of sedentary time. These findings provide evidence of the U.S. obesogenic environment's potential impact on unhealthy lifestyle behaviors among low-income Hispanic women.\nFIG. 1. Associations of acculturation with postpartum weight retention. Model 1 adjusts for months postpartum at study entry. Model 2 adjusts for postpartum months at study entry, age at study entry, education level, breastfeeding, and parity. Model 3 adjusts for postpartum months at study entry, age at study entry, breastfeeding, parity, HEI2010 score, total minutes of sedentary activity, and prepregnancy BMI. Model 4 adjusts for postpartum months at study entry, age at study entry, breastfeeding, parity, HEI2010 score, total minutes of sedentary activity, prepregnancy BMI, and gestational weight gain. *p < 0.05.\nPPWR and GWG were highly correlated in our study and the inclusion of GWG removed associations. Although previous studies have shown that PPWR is direct of GWG, some women gain weight during the postpartum year and this may be most likely among women of Hispanic ethnicity. 38 Prospective studies are needed to examine these relationships in minority populations, particularly Hispanic women.\nOur study had several strengths. First, our study used a validated, multidimensional acculturation scale that accounts for the complex process by which individuals assimilate to U.S. culture, an improvement over previous studies that have used single proxy measures (e.g., language preference, nativity, generation). Second, physical activity was objectively measured using accelerometer data, which reduces potential recall bias. Third, maternal diet was assessed using dietary recalls, which are considered the gold standard in nutrition research. Fourth, postpartum weight was measured and collected at participating WIC clinics using a standardized protocol.\nA limitation of our study was the cross-sectional design with retrospective report of GWG, which limits our ability to infer any causal effects. To address this limitation, we examined the robustness of our results after further adjusting for GWG and the effect estimate was attenuated and no longer statistically significant. Future studies utilizing follow-up data from FitMoms/Mam\u00e1s Activas RCT will be able to better characterize the mediating effect of GWG on the acculturation-PPWR association.

While obesity affects both men and women across all ages, multiple issues are particularly germane to women's health, particularly as obesity is more prevalent among women than men in the United States and obesity among women of reproductive health relates to the growing issue of childhood obesity. Discussed herein are the epidemiology and pathophysiology of obesity along with the impact of perinatal obesity on fetal programming. Guidance on screening and management of obesity through lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic therapy, and bariatric surgery, as well as avoidance of weight-promoting medications wherever possible, is elaborated. Particular attention is paid to the contribution of these modalities to weight loss as well as their impact on obesity-related comorbidities that affect a woman's overall health, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and her reproductive and gynecologic health. With modest weight loss, women with obesity can achieve notable improvements in chronic medical conditions, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and symptoms of pelvic floor disorders. Moreover, as children born to women after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss show improved metabolic outcomes, this demonstrates a role for maternal weight loss in reducing risk of development of metabolic disturbances in children. In light of the immense cost burden and mortality from obesity, it is important to emphasize the role of lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic management, and bariatric surgery for weight loss in clinical practice to mitigate the impact of obesity on women's health.", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "O besity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, and it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Obesity may be measured and categorized in various ways, which include body mass index (BMI), waist size, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and percent body fat. The most commonly used measure of obesity is BMI, which is a surrogate marker for a person's body fat composition, based on a person's weight in kilograms and height in meters. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal weight. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9, and BMI of 30 or greater is considered obese. Data obtained from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that the overall prevalence of obesity among adults in 2013-2014 was 37.7%. 1 Among women, the prevalence was 40.4% compared with 35.0% among men. The prevalence of class 3 obesity, defined as BMI \u202140, is also noted to be significantly higher in women than men, at 9.9% compared with 5.5%. The prevalence of overall obesity and the prevalence of class 3 obesity in women have both increased in a linear manner over the decade from 2005 to 2014, even adjusted for age, race, smoking status, and education. Among U.S. adults seeking care in federally funded health centers in 2009, 76% have been found to be overweight or obese (BMI \u202125 kg/m 2 ). 2 In this population, women are more likely to have obesity compared to men, and also more likely to receive referrals to a nutritionist or weight-loss prescriptions.\nThe epidemic of obesity has also worsened in children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, with NHANES data showing the prevalence of overall obesity to be 17.0% in 2011-2014. 3 In children and adolescents, the prevalence of extreme obesity, defined as a BMI \u2021120% of the sex-specific 95th percentile on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) BMI-for-age growth charts, was found to be 5.8% over the same period. 3 Obesity among women of reproductive age plays a role in the intergenerational transmission of obesity from mother to child. Therefore, it is worth noting that the prevalence of obesity in the prepregnant population appears to have increased consistently by an average of 0.5 percentage points every year from 2003 to 2009 in women across most age groups and racial/ethnic backgrounds based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System in 20 U.S. states. 4 Cost Burden\nObesity is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States and leads to an enormous amount of annual healthcare expenditures. 5 In 2005, obesity was responsible for *1 in 10 deaths among U.S. adults. In 2009, the cost of obesity was *$300 billion, which includes $173 billion in lost productivity and $130 billion in medical expenditures. Over a 14-year period, persons with obesity contributed on average an additional $1,809/person spending on healthcare services compared with those without obesity.\nObesity also contributes to increased out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, hospital inpatient expenses, hospital outpatient expenses, emergency room service expenses, and office-based medical provider expenses. Data show that the incremental cost due to obesity is higher among women than men resulting in total healthcare expenses being 31% higher in women. The two major sources of costs are inpatient care and prescription drugs, which led to 62% of healthcare expenditures due to obesity.\nFederal, state, and local governments and elected officials recognize obesity as an astronomical public health problem. 6 National initiatives from former First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move Campaign to Healthy People 2010 and 2020, the Institute of Medicine's plan to measure progress in obesity prevention, have brought the problem of obesity firmly into the arena of public policy.

For those born in more recent birth cohorts, obesity contributes to a greater extent to their all-cause mortality risk than those born in earlier cohorts. 8 Among black women, the relationship between BMI and mortality risk is significantly weaker compared with white women. One reason may be that BMI is not a perfect surrogate for adiposity. Also, black women and white women at the same BMI may have different associated levels of dyslipidemia. 9 Waist circumference (WC) is a better surrogate for central adiposity. 10 Age is an important factor as the burden of obesity is greatest in those aged 40-64 years. 5 In women \u202165 years old, obesity and elevated WC are associated with a higher risk of death, rates of major chronic disease, and disability before reaching 85 years. 10 Maximum BMI over the course of a woman's life has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality than just BMI at a given snapshot in her life. 11 ", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Pathophysiology", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Genetics", "text": "There is a strong genetic component to the likelihood of having obesity.

A 2001 study by Hediger et al. used NHANES data to find inconsistent association between breastfeeding and its duration and the risk of being overweight in children. 18 However, Arenz et al. in a 2004 meta-analysis using nine studies with more than 69,000 participants showed that breastfeeding reduced the risk of obesity in childhood significantly, with adjusted odds ratio of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71, 0.85), thus pointing to a small but consistent protective effect against obesity in children. 19 Horta et al. in a 2015 systematic review and metaanalysis reached a similar conclusion, finding that breastfeeding was inversely associated with overweight and obesity with a pooled odds ratio of 0.74 (95% CI 0.70, 0.78). 20 The PROBIT randomized control trial saw no protective effect against overweight and obesity from increased duration of exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months when evaluating differences in BMI among children at 6.5 years of age. 21 By contrast, a meta-analysis conducted by Yan et al. of 25 studies with a total of 226,508 participants found a dose/response effect from breastfeeding duration on childhood obesity, specifically noting that breastfeeding for more than 7 months significantly decreased the risk of obesity in childhood. 22 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "OBESITY IN WOMEN: INSIGHTS FOR THE CLINICIAN", "text": "The mechanism by which breastfeeding might exert a protective effect against obesity is not well understood. There are several hypotheses that McCrory and Layte explore in their 2012 article on breastfeeding and risk of overweight and obesity, including the lower energy density of breast milk compared with infant formula, the lower concentration of protein in breast milk compared with infant formula, the delayed introduction of complementary foods with breastfeeding, which may be protective against the development of obesity in later life, and the occurrence of bioactive compounds such as leptin or ghrelin in human breast milk, which have a role in satiety and regulation of hunger. 23 Indeed, serum levels of appetite-regulating hormone such as leptin, ghrelin, and insulin in infants at 1, 3, and 6 months of age have been shown to be lower in breastfed children compared with formula-fed children. 24 Further research is still needed to elucidate the mechanism by which breastfeeding exerts an effect on child health and metabolism.\nReducing fetal exposure to an obesogenic intrauterine environment can lessen risk of development of metabolic disturbances in children. Smith et al. studied women undergoing biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery, a type of bariatric weight-loss surgery, and compared outcomes in children born to these women before and after surgery. 25 The authors noted sustained improvements in insulin, glucose, and lipid profile in women of reproductive age with obesity to levels seen in healthy lean individuals. In their study, weightloss surgery was also associated with fewer pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertension (HTN), and pre-eclampsia.\nEven more remarkably, the same study showed that BPD produced persistent differences in metabolic outcomes among children born to women after BPD surgery compared with children born to these women before surgery. 25 Children born after surgery had decreased incidence of macrosomia, had lower BMI-for-age, improved lipid profile, reduction in markers of insulin resistance, and improvements in levels of satiety-related hormones. There was a threefold reduction in prevalence of severe obesity among children born after surgery.\nRecent evidence also indicates that father's BMI is also predictive of obesity. Fathers with obesity have children who are at higher risk of developing metabolic disease later in life, independent of the body weight of the mother. 26 Comprehensive profiling of sperm epigenome from lean men and men with obesity in a study by Donkin et al. showed markedly different small noncoding RNA expression and DNA methylation patterns.

The authors also found evidence of increased gliosis in the mediobasal hypothalamus when evaluating humans with obesity.

A study by Collado et al. found that the gut of pregnant women with overweight and obesity had higher levels of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Staphylococcus and lower levels of Bifidobacterium than the gut of women of normal weight. 31 Notably, these differences were passed on to offspring, as noted in a subsequent study which demonstrated that the prevalence of Bacteroides and Staphylococcus was higher in the gut of babies of mothers with overweight. 32 Likewise, in evaluating specific associations between gut biome and weight status in children, Kalliomaki et al. noted that early-age differences in fecal microbiota were potentially predictive of childhood weight, as children who maintained healthy weight tended to have higher Bifidobacterium counts, whereas other microbes such as Staphylococcus were elevated in children who became overweight. 33 The authors hypothesized that Bifidobacterium plays an anti-inflammatory role.

The bedrock of their recommendations is ongoing screening by primary care providers of patient BMI and obesity-related comorbidities to identify patients in whom weight-loss treatment is indicated. A detailed workup to help guide treatment would entail gathering information on weight and lifestyle histories to determine contributory factors, including previous weight-loss attempts, dietary habits, physical activity, family history of obesity, and medical conditions and medications that can affect weight.\nIn patients who express readiness to make lifestyle change, the first step is devising goals for weight loss. The AHA/ ACC/TOS Expert Panel has recommended an initial loss goal of 5% to 10% of baseline weight within 6 months. Patients should first be offered comprehensive lifestyle intervention, as outlined by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) ''Clinical Practice Guidelines.'' 48 In this respect, both the quantity and quality of nutrition and physical activity are important factors in the development of overweight and obesity. While the main dietary strategy for women has been to reduce caloric intake reduction by >500 kcal/day for a total dietary intake of 1,200-1,500 kcal/day, 48 Lindberg et al. have used data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find that increased BMI is best predicted by a combination of fat and sugar additives in food, accounting for 96% of variance in BMI in women, while fats and sweeteners were found to have direct effect on BMI. 49 This highlights the impact of particular foods in increasing risk for compulsive eating and obesity.\nWith regard to physical activity, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ''2008 Physical Activity Guidelines'' for the general public recommend 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) per week (*21 minutes per day) for preventing unhealthy weight gain. 50 Maher et al. have used NHANES data on accelerometerrecorded intensity of certain physical activities such as walking and jogging to study the relationship between obesity and time spent in activities considered MVPA-those who met a threshold of motion-induced acceleration defined as \u20212,020 counts per minute. 51 By dividing MVPA times into tertiles, they found a significantly increased risk of obesity in women with moderate MVPA (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.50, 2.52) and low MVPA (OR 2.84, 95% CI 2.16, 3.73) compared with the highest MVPA tertile. They also noted that MVPA at the vicinity of *20 minutes per day may be protective against obesity. However, these findings pertain largely to those who are normal weight and have always maintained normal weight.\nData from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), using a cohort of more than 10,000 individuals-80% of them women-who have successfully lost at least 13.6 kg (30 lbs) of weight and kept it off for at least 1 year, paint a different picture for those attempting to lose weight. 52 The average weekly amount of exercise activity reported by NWCR participants translates to *60-75 minutes per day (5-6.5 kcal/min) of moderate-intensity activity such as brisk walking or *35-45 minutes (8-10 kcal/min) of vigorous activity such as jogging per day. 53 This has resulted in the separate recommendation by HHS of 60-90 minutes of MVPA per day for those attempting to lose weight or maintain weight loss. 50 As per the American Medical Association and the American College of Sports Medicine's ''Exercise is Medicine'' initiative, physicians can provide an office physical activity assessment and a prescription and referral for physical activity. 54 An effective exercise prescription requires that frequency, intensity, type of exercise, time required, and periodic progress protocol be defined for the patient to ensure a sufficient dose of exercise to improve health and weight outcomes. It should also take into account pre-existing level of activity and presence of comorbid medical conditions such as CVD, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and renal disease with or without symptoms-these should prompt medical clearance before adopting a structured exercise program. 55 In terms of defining the days per week of moderate-tovigorous exercise and the average number of minutes per day of exercise at that level, there are several studies that have attempted to clarify optimal levels. While the average weekly amount of self-reported physical activity of individuals in the NWCR cohort was *60-75 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or *35-45 minutes of vigorous activity, it is important to note that the standard deviation of the average weekly kilocalories of physical activity as reported by NWCR members was quite high, suggesting a sizeable degree of variance in the range of weekly kilocalories of physical activity. 53 Given the potential for bias in self-reported data on physical activity, it is helpful to analyze the findings of Phelan et al. who used accelerometry to provide an objective assessment of the amount and intensity of physical activity undertaken of individuals who had lost and maintained weight and those who have always had normal BMI with stable weight. 56,57 The weightloss-maintainer group spent significantly more minutes per day than the always-normal-weight group in physical activity (58.6 vs. 52.1; p = 0.0001), with more minutes spent in higher intensity activities (24.4 vs. 16.9; p = 0.02). The majority of individuals in the always-normal-weight group engaged in 30-60 minutes per day of physical activity, whereas a greater proportion of individuals in the weight-loss-maintainer group engaged in >60 minutes per day of physical activity ( p = 0.002).\nThus, it is important to advise patients that substantial weight loss requires levels of physical activity that are well above the minimum recommended levels for the general population. However, physical activity even without concomitant weight loss is still beneficial in those with overweight and obesity, who are at risk for CVDs. 58 ", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Mental health factors", "text": "The potential for lifestyle interventions in weight regulation is great, however, this necessitates better characterization of behavioral characteristics in each patient. One notable model is the lifestyle pattern questionnaire developed by Kushner et al. The questionnaire attempts to collect meaningful information on patient's dietary and physical activity profile in addition to associated attitudinal, emotional, and social factors that are correlated with increasing BMI. 59 The usual pattern of weight loss in patients undergoing a lifestyle intervention, such as a structured program with support from a nutritionist or trained exercise specialist, is that the maximum weight loss is achieved at 6 months, followed by a plateau and gradual regain over time. 47 However, sustainable behavior change requires time and support in order for it to become automatic. Behavioral interventions, although they vary in their scope, can help through provision of strategies for self-monitoring, individualized or group meetings, stress reduction, cognitive restructuring, behavioral contracting, and mobilization of social support. 48 It is also important to address psychological risk factors that may be associated with weight gain in patients. Carpenter et al. surveyed a sample of 40,086 African Americans and white Americans, and found that relative to average-weight women, obese women had increased odds of past-year major depression (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.09, 1.73). Also, increasing BMI was associated with increased odds of suicide ideation (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.13, 1.32). 60 Greenberg et al. noted a high incidence of depression, negative body image, eating disorders, and low quality of life among weight-loss surgery candidates with BMI >40 or BMI >35 with an obesity-related comorbidity in their systemic review of articles related to weight-loss surgery and mental health. 61 Moreover, the psychological influences promoting weight gain can date back to childhood. In a prospective study of 496 adolescent girls, Stice et al. found that self-reported dietary restraint, radical weight-control behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perceived parental obesity-but not high-fat food consumption, binge eating, or exercise frequencypredicted obesity onset. 62 A cross-sectional analysis by Heerman et al. reviewed caregiver reports of nine types of adverse family experiences (AFEs), including socioeconomic hardship, parental separation or death or incarceration, racial/ethnic discrimination, exposure to neighborhood and domestic violence, and presence of an individual with mental illness or with drug/alcohol use in the home, using the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health of children aged 10-17 years. 63 Nearly one-third (30.5%) of children had experienced \u20212 AFEs. The prevalence of obesity among children experiencing \u20212 AFEs was 20.4%, compared with 12.5% among children with 0 AFEs. Children with \u20212 AFEs in childhood were more likely to have obesity (adjusted OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.47, 2.17; p < 0.001) than those with 0 AFEs.\nAnother study by Williamson et al. evaluated 13,177 members of a California health maintenance organization aged 19-92 years. Physical abuse and verbal abuse were found to be strongly associated with body weight and obesity. 64 Compared with those experiencing no physical abuse (55%), a person being ''often hit and injured'' (2.5%) had a 4.0 kg (95% CI 2.4, 5.6 kg) higher weight and an RR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2, 1.6) for a BMI \u202130. Study group members who were ''often verbally abused'' (9.5%) had an RR of 1.9 (95% CI 1.3, 2.7) for BMI \u202140 compared with those experiencing no verbal abuse (53%).\nIn attempting to find a mechanism for how chronic stress may increase comfort food intake and body weight gain, Dallman et al. found that comfort food ingestion produced abdominal obesity and decreased CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. They also noted that in depressed humans who overeat, there are decreased levels of cerebrospinal corticotropin-releasing factor, catecholamine concentrations, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity. 65 They hypothesized that people eat comfort food in an attempt to re-duce the activity in the chronic stress/response network with its attendant anxiety.

These medications have been studied in large randomized clinical trials that generally include a larger proportion of females to males. 48 Both orlistat and liraglutide have been effective in modifying eating behaviors, inducing weight loss, improving metabolic parameters, and regulating ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

In addition to the role of the physician/surgeon, the behavior intervention is effectively executed by a multidisciplinary team that includes dietitians, nurses, educators, pharmacists, clinical exercise physiologists, occupational and physical therapists, and clinical psychologists.

Almost one-third of women in NBSR had menstrual dysfunction at baseline. BMI fell in the first year postoperatively from 48.2 -8.3 to 37.4 -7.5 kg/m 2 ( p < 0.001). In the postoperative period, the prevalence in the NBSR group of T2D fell by 54%, PCOS by 15%, and any menstrual dysfunction by 12%. However, further randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery on reproductive function. 73 Attempts have also been made to understand the impact of bariatric surgery on obstetric outcomes. A systematic review of case-control and cohort studies on pregnancy and bariatric surgery by Guelinckx et al. notes a linear association between maternal prepregnancy BMI and mean birthweight. 71 In a study comparing pre-and postoperative pregnancies of women who underwent BPD, a decreased incidence of macrosomic infants as well as an increased incidence of healthy maternal weight gain was found. 75 In a retrospective study of all women who delivered after bariatric surgery in a tertiary unit in Israel between 1988 and 2006, encompassing 301 deliveries preceding bariatric surgery and 507 following surgery, Weintraub et al. found decreased rates of GDM in pregnancy after surgery, at 17.3% versus 11.0%, as well as decreased rates of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, at 23.6% versus 11.2%. 76 A study from Sweden compared 596 singleton pregnancies in women who had previously undergone bariatric surgery with 2,356 control pregnancies in women matched for presurgery BMI, age, parity, smoking history, educational level, and delivery year; this study reported lower incidences of GDM and large for gestational age babies in the postbariatric surgery women. 77 However, rates of small for gestational age births and shorter gestation periods were higher in the postbariatric surgery women than in controls. A recent metaanalysis of 11 cohort studies compared maternal and fetal outcomes in obese women who had undergone bariatric surgery with obese women who had not had surgery. 78 The findings included lower likelihood of GDM, HTN, and macrosomia following bariatric surgery but increased odds of offspring being small for gestational age; rates of cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, and preterm delivery were not significantly different.\nNarayanan and Syed also note that the first 12 months after bariatric surgery represent an active catabolic state due to rapid weight loss, with gradual stabilization of the body's nutritional state in the following months. Thus, women should generally be advised to avoid pregnancy for 12-24 months after bariatric surgery. 79 Operative complications are not uncommon with bariatric surgery and several cases have pointed to the increased risk for nutritional deficiencies in a subsequent pregnancy. 71,79,80 Nutrient deficiencies may be minimal after gastric banding, whereas gastric bypass may be associated with deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, other fat-soluble vitamins, and trace elements. 79 Sleeve gastrectomy is associated with the same deficiencies but less severe. BPD procedures are associated with malabsorption of protein, fat, and micronutrients such as vitamins A, D, and B12, calcium, iron, selenium, zinc, and copper. Women of childbearing age should have regular monitoring for deficiencies, with care being taken to ensure that supplements are safe in pregnancy. Physiological increase in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity that occurs in early gestation increases the risk of hypoglycemia in women who conceive following bariatric surgery. The standard oral glucose tolerance test is frequently poorly tolerated in women who have had the above procedures causing significantly distressing symptoms from early dumping as well as profound reactive hypoglycemia from late dumping. Dumping refers to when food, especially sugar, moves too fast from the stomach to the duodenum. Continuous glucose monitoring over 1-2 weeks around 24-28 weeks of gestational age may be better tolerated.\nThe mainstay to management of postprandial hypoglycemia is dietary modifications, namely, a diet high in dietary quality and fiber and low in processed carbohydrates. The increased abdominal pressure, anatomical repositioning of the intra-abdominal organs during pregnancy, and frequent occurrence of emesis during pregnancy can predispose to technical problems with gastric banding. 71 Band adjustability can permit adaptation to the altered requirements of pregnancy and thus allows for healthy maternal weight gain and normal birthweight babies. 80 The management of postbariatric surgery pregnancies can benefit from a team approach, including a maternal/fetal medicine specialist, bariatric surgeon, and nutritionist. 81 We can look forward to continuing insights on this topic, as evidenced by the ongoing AURORA trial, a prospective cohort study extensively monitoring women who undergo bariatric surgery up until a subsequent pregnancy and their postpartum period. 82 There are also alternatives to conventional bariatric surgery, with one example being intra-abdominal vagal nerve blockade. The ReCharge randomized clinical trial, involving 239 participants with BMI 40-45 kg/m 2 or with a BMI of 35-40 kg/m 2 with 1 or more obesity-related conditions, had 162 patients receive an active vagal nerve block device and 77 receive a sham device. 83 The objective was to determine if vagal nerve block was superior to sham by a 10-point margin with at least 55% of patients in the vagal block group achieving a 20% loss and 45% achieving a 25% loss. The vagal nerve block group had a mean 24.4% excess weight loss versus 15.9% excess weight loss in the sham group. The mean difference in the percentage of the excess weight loss between groups was 8.5 percentage points (95% CI 3.1, 13.9). At 12 months, 52% of patients in the vagal nerve block group achieved 20% or more excess weight loss and 38% achieved 25% or more excess weight loss versus 32% in the sham group who achieved 20% or more loss and 23% who achieved 25% or more loss. The adverse event rate in the vagal nerve block group was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.4%, 7.9%), which consisted mainly of heartburn, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lifestyle", "text": "Tailored lifestyle modification helps patients develop strategies to manage the external food environment. Higher autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, and self-regulation skills have emerged through research as the best predictors of beneficial weight and physical activity outcomes. 84 In this respect, pregnancy, perhaps unlike any other time in a woman's life, presents a period of increased contact with healthcare providers and pregnant women may be especially motivated to make lifestyle changes out of concern for the health of their offspring. 85,86 In the NIH-sponsored Diabetes Prevention Program study of 3,000 prediabetic patients with obesity, almost 70% of whom were women, patients were randomized into a control group, a medication group (metformin 850 mg twice a day), and a lifestyle intervention group. 87 It was found that intensive lifestyle intervention using diet, exercise, and behavior modification with support from individual counseling resulted in increased sustained weight loss compared with taking metformin alone. After 6 months of intervention, subjects in the lifestyle group lost significantly more weight compared with the other groups, with half of them reaching the 7% loss of initial body weight goal. At 4 years from enrollment, compared with placebo, the lifestyle group achieved a 58% reduction in progression to diabetes, whereas the metformin group attained a 31% reduction.\nIn a study by Huseinovic et al. of 110 postpartum women with a self-reported BMI \u202127 at 6-15 weeks postpartum who were randomly assigned to a group receiving a structured 12-week diet behavior modification treatment by a dietitian based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations or a control group, it was found that a low-intensity diet treatment delivered by a dietitian produced clinically relevant and sustainable weight loss, with 6.1 kg lost in the treatment group versus 1.6 kg lost in the control group at 12 weeks, and 10 kg versus 4.3 kg lost, respectively, at 1 year. 88 Studies comparing treatment groups using pharmacotherapy alone versus pharmacotherapy plus lifestyle and dietary modification show greater ability to achieve expected weight loss when using both modalities and show greater patient satisfaction with the medication and with one's health, appearance, and self-esteem. 89 Here the findings from the NWCR are particularly germane. Klem et al. noted that approximately one-half of NWCR participants lost weight without any formal assistance and an equal number used commercial or self-help programs. 90 While there was immense diversity of dietary strategies and physical activities used by registry members, some common factors were observed, with nearly every member of the registry using a combination of diet plus exercise to both lose weight and maintain weight loss. Their strategies, however, varied and appeared to produce energy intakes well below national averages in addition to a high quantity of MVPA that resulted in an average weekly energy expenditure that met or exceeded recommended levels. It is worth noting that this was self-reported data subject to bias.\nPhysicians should help patients set realistic weight reduction goals and encourage them to begin with keeping a daily food record and increasing daily physical activity. 40,89 Recommendations for patients to aim for a ''normal BMI'' should be discouraged as they are often unrealistic. 87,91 They also noted that women and those with higher BMI had greater weight-loss expectations and goals. Kyle and colleagues have found that the belief that exercise is a very effective way to lose weight is stronger in individuals with higher weight status, even though this idea is contrary to evidence. This belief is also a strong predictor of discouragement with exercise. 92 Women who exercise for appearance or weightrelated reasons have been observed to be less persistent with exercise and have a poorer body image when compared with peers. Therefore, patients may need to be counseled about realistic weight-loss patterns and the importance of dietary modification as a cornerstone of weight loss.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "OBESITY IN WOMEN: INSIGHTS FOR THE CLINICIAN", "text": "Providing ongoing support structures for behavioral change (including family, community, and medical resources) can increase the likelihood of behavior change and success. Furthermore, it is important to appreciate that exercise and physical activity can improve body composition profile through increased muscle mass as well as decreased total and visceral fat-thereby reducing comorbidities and medications-even when no weight change is apparent. 93 In addition, decreased sedentary time may itself be an independent factor in improved body composition profile. Maher et al. find that total sedentary time is not associated with increased risk of obesity, whereas Healy et al. have found significant positive associations between sedentary time and WC using NHANES 2003-2006 data. 51,94 In terms of more small-scale interventions that may have clinical benefits, healthy adults can take anywhere between *4,000 and 18,000 steps/day, and 10,000 steps/day is a reasonable target for healthy adults. In the AusDiab study, of 1,126 men and women in Tasmania, Australia, who wore a pedometer, the authors found that increasing daily steps was associated with a decline in the obesity measures, with a sharper decline for those with lower baseline daily steps. An additional 2,000 steps for those taking only 2,000 steps per day at baseline was associated with a reduction of 2.2 cm in WC among women (95% CI 0.6, 3.9 cm) compared with a 0.6 cm in reduction in women (95% CI 0.2, 1.0) already walking 10,000 steps daily. 95 In a review of studies on pedometer use and the association with increased activity and resultant change in BMI, Bravata et al. used 26 studies with a total of 2,767 participants with mean intervention duration of 18 weeks. 96 An important predictor of increased physical activity among participants was having a step goal such as 10,000 steps per day ( p = 0.001). Pedometer users significantly decreased their BMI by 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05, 0.72; p = 0.03).

They also report that women have higher concentrations of leptin, an appetite regulation hormone that reduces energy intake. There is, however, little consensus on whether these physiological mechanisms have practical implications for difference in weight-loss success between the two genders.

Furthermore, certain risks of obesity treatment are more relevant to women, most notably decreasing bone mineral density and potential teratogenicity of some pharmacotherapies. 87 The percentage of women of reproductive age who suffer from PCOS is 6%-21%, of whom 30%-75% have obesity. 48 Lifestyle modification is the first-line treatment in PCOS, even though it is associated with low adherence and sustainability. A systematic review by Naderpoor et al. of 12 randomized clinical trials with 608 women with PCOS demonstrated that lifestyle intervention plus metformin is associated with lower BMI, decreased amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and also associated with improved menstruation and lower testosterone. 98 Patients with overweight or obesity and PCOS should be considered for treatment with orlistat, metformin, or liraglutide, alone or in combination, because these medications can be effective in decreasing weight or improving PCOS manifestations. 48 With respect to menopause, perimenopausal weight gain is common due to biological and environmental factors as well as use of certain drugs, for example, steroids, insulin, and glitazones. 99 In patients who gain weight due to age or medication use, lifestyle interventions and pharmacologic options can be used to induce weight loss. In those patients with obesity at risk of developing diabetes or those who have already developed diabetes, metformin and/or exenatide can be used as adjunctive medications. As Samat et al. note, while neither metformin nor exenatide is licensed for weight loss, treatment with metformin and with exenatide has been shown in separate trials to produce weight loss in addition to helping achieve glycemic control.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Weight-promoting medications", "text": "An important consideration for clinical practice is the role of medications in inducing weight gain. Certain pharmacotherapies that are aimed at obesity-related comorbidities, such as diabetes and HTN, can actually cause weight gain, which in turn exerts a deleterious effect on glucose control, blood pressure, lipid profile, and CVD risk. 100 Medicines that promote glycemic control, including insulin, insulin-secretagogues, and peripheral insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinedione, are culprits in drug-induced weight gain. 100 Combination therapy of insulin and metformin has been shown to promote less weight gain compared with insulin therapy alone. Clinical studies also report less weight gain with peakless long-acting insulin glargine and basal insulin detemir than with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin.\nIncreases in body weight have also been documented with traditional beta-blockers such as propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol, with most of the weight gain occurring within the first few months of starting therapy. 101 By contrast, carvedilol has not been associated with exacerbating weight gain in the GEMINI study of 1,164 diabetic and hypertensive patients. 102 Beta-blockade is hypothesized to reduce total energy expenditure in obese hypertensive patients and has a documented negative effect on exercise capacity. 103 Although certain beta-blockers have important absolute indications for use, alternatives include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which are associated with less weight gain and even weight loss in some cases. 101 Chronic corticosteroid use is known to cause weight gain due to increased truncal adipose tissue. 100 For women, a combination of oral contraceptives (estrogen plus progestin) has not been conclusively found to be weight promoting, however, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) does induce weight gain. More well known is the role of psychotropic medications in inducing weight gain. Antipsychotics block anticholinergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic sites, all of which are related to appetite stimulation. 104 Atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine) cause marked weight gain and may also exert a diabetogenic influence. 105 Mood stabilizers and antiepileptics such as lithium, valproic acid derivatives, carbamazepine, gabapentin, and lamotrigine are also weight-gain promoters. 106 Notably, however, topiramate is utilized as a weight-loss therapeutic. 100 The mechanisms by which certain antidepressants cause more weight loss are unclear. Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) were thought to be weight-loss promoters due to their serotonin-enhancing effect. However, in clinical practice, marked weight gain after initial weight loss is a common and well-known side effect of paroxetine, a commonly used SSRI. 100 This is less true for other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and sertraline. By contrast, venlafaxine, which is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and nefazodone, which is a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, are both weight neutral. In addition, stimulants are a class of psychotropic drugs that have been used in treatment of obesity. 104 While psychotropic medications are notoriously weight promoting, multiple trials of patients taking antipsychotics, who are treated with adjunctive metformin, have shown a ", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Levels of evidence", "text": "Weight-loss treatment indicated in those with BMI \u202130 kg/m 2 and those with BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m 2 with increased cardiovascular risk, for example, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 47 Level I Initial weight-loss goal between 5% and 10% of baseline weight within 6 months is appropriate.

Medications to promote weight loss include naltrexone and bupropion, liraglutide, lorcaserin, orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate. 48 Level I Bariatric surgery may be considered in adults with a BMI \u202140 kg/m 2 or a BMI \u202135 kg/m 2 with obesityrelated comorbidities who are motivated to lose weight but have not responded to lifestyle intervention with or without pharmacotherapy. 47 Level I Nutrient deficiencies after certain bariatric surgery procedures include deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, other fat soluble vitamins, and trace elements.

The majority of respondents agreed (50.0%) or strongly agreed (26.6%) that excessive GWG is a major health concern, often or always calculate the body mass index (BMI) of their patients (79.1%), and use BMI to modify their weight gain recommendations (78.5%).

Pregnant women may be more receptive to advice concerning lifestyle choices, especially if phrased as being for the benefit of their baby. Thus, pregnancy has been suggested to represent a ''teachable moment'' in women's lives during which physician advice regarding healthy lifestyle behaviors may have lasting beneficial effects. 1 Gaining an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy is an important factor for neonatal and maternal health both immediately postpartum and well into the future. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has endorsed the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated recommendations on weight gain during pregnancy 2 modified by prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (Table 1). 3 Excessive weight gain during pregnancy has become more prevalent than inadequate weight gain, as has the proportion of pregnant women who are overweight or obese prepregnancy. In 2011-2012, 58.5% of women in the U.S. between the ages of 20 and 39 years had a BMI greater than 25 kg/m 2 . 4 Published data from 46 states, the District of Columbia and New York city, indicate that in 2012 and 2013 about half (mean 47.5%, range 38.2-54.7%) of U.S. pregnant women gain weight in excess of the IOM recommendations, 5,6 with overweight and obese women the most likely to gain more than the IOM recommendations. [5][6][7] Data from 2015 on pregnant women in 48 states and the District of Columbia indicate no change, with 48% gaining excessive weight and a majority of overweight and obese women gaining above the IOM recommendations. 8 Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is a risk factor for macrosomia, cesarean section, and postpartum weight retention, 2 as well as a significant risk factor for future obesity of both mother and child. [9][10][11] Counseling on gestational weight gain (GWG) by healthcare providers to increase patient understanding of the risks of excessive weight gain and the potential benefits of meeting the IOM recommendations may be an important component in efforts to reduce the prevalence of excessive GWG. However, it is not clear to what extent providers are effectively counseling patients on weight gain during pregnancy. In a study of normal weight and overweight women in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks gestation), although women who reported receiving weight gain advice from their providers generally received advice consistent with the IOM guidelines, a majority of the women (58.3%) reported they received no advice. 12 A qualitative study of providers (family physicians, obstetricians, and nurse midwives) found that providers did not place a priority on appropriate weight gain, had few resources for patients, and believed that any advice they gave was unlikely to be followed. 13 A study of obstetric and family medicine residents in 2010 found they had minimal knowledge of the 2009 IOM recommendations. 14 A study of 30 pregnant women and 11 providers in 2014 found that although all providers and most patients (87%) reported giving/receiving counseling regarding GWG, only about half (55% for providers and 47% for patients) reported giving/ receiving a specific recommendation. Provider knowledge of the IOM recommendations was weak, with four of the eleven reporting they were not even familiar with them, and few being able to accurately give the recommendations for all BMI categories. 15 To assess obstetrician-gynecologists' knowledge, counseling practices, and opinions regarding weight gain during pregnancy and to identify potential factors to explain variation in knowledge and practice, the ACOG Research Department conducted two questionnaire studies; one before (2012) and one after (2014) ACOG published ACOG Committee Opinion 548 on GWG. 3 A secondary goal was to assess whether ACOG Committee Opinion 548 endorsing the IOM recommendations affected knowledge and practice.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "In August of 2012, 3 years after the updated IOM guidance but before ACOG published Committee Opinion 548 on weight gain during pregnancy 3 endorsing the IOM guidance, a questionnaire focusing on knowledge, practice, and opinions regarding weight gain during pregnancy was sent to 300 members of the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network (CARN), a group of over 1000 Fellows of the College, who voluntarily participate in four to six surveys annually without compensation to facilitate assessment of practice patterns and development of professional education. The questionnaire included demographic questions, including gender, age, years in practice, board certification, and practice characteristics (type, location, patient characteristics, and time distribution). Only physicians who provided prenatal care were asked to complete the survey. To assess attitudes and practice patterns related to weight gain during pregnancy, respondents were asked about prenatal screening, knowledge of IOM recommendations (yes or no answers), and their degree of agreement with statements regarding weight management in patients, management of weight in patients, and their belief in their ability to help patients maintain a healthy weight (using five-point Likert scales). The selected CARN members received both paper mailings and emails with a link to an online version of the survey.\nIn January 2014, 1 year after the release of ACOG Committee Opinion 548, 3 a revised version of the 2012 questionnaire that included an additional question on insurance status of the patient population was sent to 546 ACOG Fellows and Junior Fellows in practice. Of these, 246 were CARN members (different from the previous 300) and the other 300 survey recipients were randomly selected ACOG Fellows and Junior Fellows who did not belong to CARN, to test the extent to which the results from CARN members could be generalized to practicing ACOG Fellows as a whole. The survey was mailed along with a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study and a postage-paid return envelope. Four follow-up mailings were sent to nonresponders.\nPhysician confidence in their ability to influence their patients' GWG was measured by two parameters using the questions listed in Table 2: a binary parameter based on the first question listed in Table 2 (0 for not confident and 1 for confident or very confident) to be used in v 2 analysis, and a confidence score constructed using a principle component analysis (PCA) on all six questions listed in Table 2 to be used in correlation analysis.\nData were analyzed using a personal computer-based software package (IBM SPSS Statistics \u00d2 20.0; IBM Corp \u00d2 , Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were computed for the measures used in the analyses. Group differences in responses on continuous measures were assessed with ANOVA analyses and linear regressions. Group differences on categorical measures were assessed with v 2 tests. Pearson's correlations were used to describe correlations between continuous variables, and partial correlation was used when several variables were correlated to the same outcome.

Of the 546 ACOG Fellows (246-CARN, 300-nonCARN) in the 2014 study, 5 were unreachable and 273 returned questionnaires. Of these responding physicians, 67 did not provide prenatal care, including 4 who were retired. These respondents were excluded resulting in a sample size of 206 for a response rate of 43.5%. For the 2014 survey, we were able to compare the age and sex of responders versus nonresponders. There was no difference in age between responders (50.9 -0.7 years) or nonresponders (49.8 -0.7 years; p = 0.287), but women (55.9%) were more likely to respond than were men (44.1%; p = 0.014).\nFor most of the questions on the survey, there were no differences between the two studies in the responses, and data were pooled. Where there were differences, those findings are noted and the data presented separately. In the 2014 study there were no differences in the responses between CARN members and Fellows that did not belong to CARN.\nA comparison of the demographics of the two groups of respondents is presented in Table 3. Men accounted for a higher proportion of the respondents from the 2012 survey ( p = 0.005), and the mean number of years in practice for the 2012 respondents was higher compared with the mean years in practice for the respondents to the 2014 study ( p = 0.01). There were no differences in practice structure, practice location, or the estimated ethnic/racial makeup of the patient population between the respondents to the two studies.\nVirtually all of the respondents considered managing weight gain by their pregnant patients to be part of their clinical responsibility (98.7%). A majority of respondents calculate the BMI of their patients at the first prenatal visit often or always (79.1%) and use BMI to modify their weight gain recommendations often or always (78.5%).\nMen and women differed on these questions, however. Women were more likely to calculate BMI at the first prenatal visit often or always (83.6% vs. 72.6%, p = 0.020), and women were more likely to use prepregnancy BMI to modify their The results are for pooled data from both surveys. Hispanic = 15.6% -1.3% African American = 15.9% -1.7%; Asian = 5.2% -0.6% African American = 17.8% -1.3% Asian = 4.8% -0.5% weight gain recommendations often or always (84.1% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.001). However, there was also a strong effect of years in practice for both calculating BMI and using BMI to modify weight gain recommendations (Table 4), which largely explained the male-female difference. Combining years in practice and physician gender, the only difference that remained significant was among physicians with 11-24 years in practice, with women in that group being more likely to use BMI to modify weight gain recommendations (Table 4).\nMost of the physicians were aware of the 2009 IOM guidelines (81.8%). In general, the respondents agreed with the 2009 IOM guidelines (66.2% agreed or strongly agreed), but a large proportion (25.4%) were neutral. Physician awareness and opinion of the IOM recommendations did not differ between the two studies.\nBeing aware of the IOM recommendations was associated with both calculating BMI at the first prenatal visit often or always (83.9% vs. 64.9%, p = 0.001) and with using BMI to modify weight gain recommendations often or always (81.3% vs. 64.3%; p = 0.001). Physicians who were familiar with the 2009 IOM recommendations were more likely to counsel their patients about weight gain during pregnancy often or always than those who were not familiar (93.3% vs. 80.7%; p = .006). They were also more likely to inform their pregnant patients that excessive weight gain increases the risk of pregnancy complications (83.2% vs. 61.5%, p = 0.001) and can negatively affect their baby's health (74.4% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.001).\nThe majority of respondents agreed (50.0%) or strongly agreed (26.6%) that excessive pregnancy weight gain is a major health concern for their practice. Most report that an increasing number of their prenatal patients gain too much weight (73.9% agreed or strongly agreed), and that excessive weight gain is more a problem than inadequate weight gain in their practice (86.6% agreed or strongly agreed). They disagreed that the health risks of excessive pregnancy weight gain are overstated (84.0% disagree or strongly disagree), and agreed that pregnancy weight gain contributes to the obesity epidemic (71.3% agree or strongly agree). Almost all agreed (51.9%) or strongly agreed (41.7%) that pregnancy weight gain can be modified by changes in diet and physical activity.\nBased on their own criteria, the responding physicians reported that, on average, 7.8% of their patients gained too little weight during pregnancy, 47.3% gained an appropriate amount, and 45.1% gained too much. There was no differ-ence between the two studies, men and women, or with years in practice for these opinions.\nThe 2014 study included a question asking the physicians to estimate the proportions of their patients with private insurance, Medicaid, or who are uninsured. The reported proportion of patients with private insurance was positively correlated with the physicians' perceived proportion of patients that gained an appropriate amount of weight (r = 0.231, n = 198, p = 0.001) and negatively correlated with the reported proportion of patients that gained too much weight (r = -0.205, n = 198, p = 0.004). In contrast, a reported high proportion of patients with Medicaid or uninsured were both negatively correlated with the reported proportion gaining an appropriate amount of weight (r = -0.228 and -0.181, n = 198, p = 0.001 and 0.011, respectively) and positively correlated with the reported proportion of patients that gained too much weight (r = 0.206 and 0.187, n = 198, p = 0.004 and 0.008, respectively).\nMost respondents reported counseling their pregnant patients about weight gain (91.2%) and exercise (85.8%) often or always. Only 3 of 10 respondents (30.7%) reported referring their pregnant patients for nutritional counseling often or always. A higher proportion of respondents from the 2012 survey reported informing their pregnant patients about possible harms to their baby (80.0% vs. 62.3% often or always, p = 0.001) and an increase in the risks of pregnancy complications (84.6% vs. 76.6% often or always, p = 0.002) due to excessive pregnancy weight gain. Respondents to the 2012 survey were also more likely to report they counseled their pregnant patients regarding sedentary behavior (49.5% vs. 36.1%, p = 0.023).\nOnly 6.1% of respondents were very confident in their ability to affect their patients' prenatal weight gain, and a majority (55.1%) were not confident (Table 2). Physician confidence declined with years of practice (52.7%, 46.9%, and 32.0% confident or very confident for 0 to less than 11 years, 11-24 years, and more than 24 years in practice, respectively, p = 0.011). Only 30.8% agreed and 2.5% strongly agreed with the statement ''I am successful at helping my patients gain an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy.'' Many reported it to be unlikely or very unlikely that they will actually help their patients avoid excessive weight gain, and that their patients are unlikely or very unlikely to follow their advice on weight gain, physical activity, and diet (Table 2). These opinions did not vary with years in practice. The physician confidence score created using PCA accounted for 58.5% of the variance in the six questions from Table 2. The confidence score was negatively correlated with years in practice (r = -0.128, n = 300, p = 0.026). For data from the 2014 survey that included insurance status, confidence score was negatively correlated with the reported proportion of patients with either Medicaid or uninsured (r = -0.250, n = 199, p = 0.001). The partial correlation of confidence index with the proportion of Medicaid/uninsured patients controlling for years of practice was significant (r = -0.263, n = 190, p = 0.001), but years in practice was not related to confidence score after accounting for the effect of insurance status (r = -0.118, n = 190, p = 0.102).\nPhysician confidence had a significant effect on practice. Confident physicians (based on the binary parameter) were more likely to use prepregnancy BMI to make weight gain recommendations often or always (83.6% vs. 74.8%, p = 0.009) and to counsel often or always regarding weight gain (95.7% vs. 87.3%, p = 0.001), exercise (92.1% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.003), and sedentary behavior (54.3% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.001). They were more likely to inform their patients about the increased risk of pregnancy complications (90.8% vs. 69.7%, p = 0.001) and possible harms to their baby (76.9% vs. 61.0%, p = 0.001) due to excessive weight gain. They were also more likely to refer their pregnant patients for nutritional counseling (37.1% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.010).\nThe physician confidence score was positively correlated with the physicians' estimate of the proportion of their patients that gained an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy (r = 0.330, n = 304, p = 0.001). When the effect of patient insurance status was controlled the association remained highly significant (r = 0.392, n = 202, p = 0.001).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Gaining an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy has been shown to be an important factor for neonatal and maternal health and well-being immediately postpartum and well into the future. 1 GWG in a woman's first pregnancy is a significant predictor of her weight gain in a subsequent pregnancy. 16 Excessive weight gain is associated with an increased risk for maternal hypertensive disorders and macrosomia for all maternal BMI categories, 17 although evidence indicates that even GWG within current guidelines for women above a BMI of 35 kg/m 2 is not protective against high birth weight in the baby. 18 Children of mothers with excessive GWG were at greater risk of being overweight. 9,11,19 The effect appears to extend into adolescence and beyond. 20 Daughters of mothers who gained weight above the IOM recommendations were more likely to be overweight or obese 40 years after their birth. 21 Excessive GWG appears to have the potential to propagate obesity into future generations.\nThere are some limitations to the study. Data are from physician self-report, and thus subject to concerns such as imperfect recall, among others. Although there was no difference in age between responders and nonresponders in the 2014 study, women were more likely to respond. Men and women generally did not differ in their responses to the questionnaires, suggesting that this sex difference in response rate may not matter. The number of respondents (317) is not large and a majority of the respondents (227% or 71.6%) belong to the CARN, which may limit the generalizability of the results. However, the CARN group is actively maintained to match the demographics of practicing ACOG Fellows as a whole, and has consistently been shown to be similar in knowledge, practice, and opinions from randomly selected Fellows in numerous studies over the last 20 years. For this particular study, the CARN and non-CARN responders to the second survey did not differ on any question, increasing our confidence that these results reflect those of practicing obstetrician-gynecologists.\nThe results from these two studies indicate that obstetrician-gynecologists are cognizant of the dangers of excessive weight gain during pregnancy and consider it a serious health issue in their practice. On average, the responding physicians reported that in their opinion more than 4 of 10 pregnant women under their care will gain too much weight. Their estimate is consistent with national data regarding GWG, with a mean of almost 50% of women gaining above the IOM recommendations in 2012, 2013, and 2015. 6,8 In contrast, the responding physicians reported low rates of women gaining inadequate weight during pregnancy (mean = 7.8%), as opposed to the national data that reported a value of about 20%. 6,8 One possible interpretation is that these physicians, on average, consider the IOM lower limits on weight gain to be higher than is necessary. Another possibility is that these physicians, on average, are less concerned about inadequate weight gain, and therefore are less aware of it in their practice. However, we emphasize that these values for inadequate, appropriate, and excessive GWG reflect physician perception, and are not necessarily a true estimate of the values that would be obtained from comparing medical records with the IOM recommendations.\nThere appeared to be an effect of insurance status, with uninsured and Medicaid patients estimated to be more likely to gain excessive weight. This finding must be interpreted with care, as it is based on physician self-report. Because the weight gain categorization was based on physician opinion, we cannot rule out that physicians with high rates of Medicaid or uninsured patients may be more concerned about excessive weight gain, possibly have stricter upper limits on what they consider appropriate GWG, or simply have a biased impression of the likely GWG of their patients. What we can say is that physicians with high Medicaid/uninsured patient populations perceive excessive GWG to be more frequent. To test this hypothesis, studies utilizing patient medical records would be required.\nMost of the physicians were aware of the 2009 IOM recommendations for weight gain based on prepregnancy BMI, although almost one of five was not. In general, the respondents agreed with the IOM recommendations. Being aware of the IOM recommendations was associated with better practice regarding counseling patients and using BMI to modify weight gain recommendations; however, we cannot distinguish between more knowledgeable physicians have better practice patterns versus knowledge of the IOM recommendations improves practice.\nPublication of ACOG Committee Opinion 548 appeared to have no effect on knowledge of the IOM recommendations or on practice. Whether this result is due to practice effort and patterns by physicians being set more by factors other than guidance from respected institutions (e.g., IOM and ACOG), such as personal experience regarding success at influencing their patients weight gain, or by a subset of physicians that appear not to be aware of guidance in this area (e.g., about 18% of the responding obstetrician-gynecologists reported they were unaware of the IOM recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy) cannot be determined from these data. It is disappointing that publication of ACOG Committee Opinion 548 did not even increase awareness of the IOM recommendations.\nPhysicians confident in their ability to influence their patients' weight gain during pregnancy exhibited greater and more appropriate practice effort regarding counseling on weight gain during pregnancy. Physician confidence declined with years in practice. We cannot determine whether this effect is due to younger physicians receiving more training in this area or physician experience decreases their expectation of being able to influence their patients' behavior. This finding is consistent with previous findings regarding managing weight in nonpregnant patients, in which physician confidence was a significant predictor of practice effort for weight management of patients. [22][23][24][25] This finding also suggests that providing physicians with effective tools to improve their knowledge of GWG recommendations, enhance their ability to monitor GWG relative to recommendations, and to facilitate better communication with patients regarding weight gain recommendations might be rewarded with greater physician efforts in this area in a virtuous cycle. A focus group study found that providers were aware of and concerned about the risks associated with excess GWG, but were concerned that their training was inadequate. A common motivation for participating in the focus groups was ''.to find out what other people are doing,'' indicating an interest in learning new counseling methods. 26 A recent pilot study found that plotting a pregnant patient's weight against a recommended prenatal weight gain curve appeared to increase the quality of counseling on weight gain and the patient satisfaction with counseling, 27 suggesting that developing simple tools could improve GWG counseling and effectiveness.\nIn summary, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists is cognizant of the dangers of excessive weight gain during pregnancy for women and their babies, are aware of the 2009 IOM recommendations for GWG based on prepregnancy maternal BMI, and appear to have a realistic impression of the GWG patterns of their patients (although they possibly may be underestimating low GWG). However, it is disconcerting that almost one in five were not aware of the IOM guidelines, and that ACOG's 2013 Committee Opinion endorsing those recommendations appears to have had no effect on awareness or practice. Physician confidence in their ability to influence the GWG of their patients is a strong predictor of their practice efforts, similar to findings on weight management of nonpregnant patients. [22][23][24][25] This suggests that efforts to produce tools to assist providers in communicating the importance of appropriate GWG to their patients would be well accepted, and possibly result in enhanced provider efforts to monitor and manage GWG.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "A ''teachable moment'' for weight control and obesity prevention", "journal": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "year": "2010", "authors": "S Phelan;  Pregnancy"}, {"title": "Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines", "journal": "National Academies Press", "year": "2009", "authors": ""}, {"title": "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

[6][7][8] These gender differences may influence the management of the risk factors in women.\nThere is a high recurrence within the 5 years after a myocardial infarction (MI): 15% of men and 22% of women. 9 In this context, prevention of a new MI is essential. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and secondary prevention programs are multidisciplinary and multifactorial interventions that reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of patients with CVD. 10,11 There is vast empirical evidence on the effectiveness of CR, and it is considered a Class I, Level A practice by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation. 10 Despite the recommendations in the clinical practice guidelines and the benefits, CR is underutilized. 10,12 Several studies and metaanalyses have shown participation rates ranging from 20% to 50% in CR programs. 12,13 Moreover, participation rates in women are lower than in men, with a mean enrollment rate of 38.5% and 45% for women and men, respectively. 14 A recent meta-analysis found that only 20% of the participants from the studies included were women. 15 Different systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on referral to CR programs have found that men were referred more often to these programs than women. 16,17 Moreover, several studies have shown a dropout rate ranging from 12% to 56% among the overall population. 18 To our knowledge, there is no CR dropout rate for women only, but the literature suggests that one of the factors associated with nonadherence to CR is being female. 9 Barriers to participation in CR programs for both men and women have been attributed to several factors such as lack of referral, lack of resources, and logistical problems. 13 A metasynthesis identified personal and contextual barriers, for both men and women, influencing completion of CR programs after referral, such as negative views of health services or distance and transport issues. 19 In a clinical review, authors described several barriers to CR adherence, such as psychological well-being, location, transport, and group-based CR programs. 13 Women-specific barriers for nonparticipation have been related to being apprehensive about exercise programs, comorbidities such as osteoporosis, caregiver role, lack of transportation, distance to the program, and male participant-dominated programs. 20,21 Only two reviews have specifically focused on barriers faced by women. 22,23 Scott et al. found multilevel factors influencing referral of women, enrollment, and completion of CR at the patient, provider, and programmatic level. 22 More recently, an integrative review found similar barriers to participation in CR programs. 23 Among others, barriers reported in both studies were associated with lower rates of referral, financial and transportation issues, and health perceptions. 6,22,23 Because of the growing evidence of the benefits of CR, it becomes necessary to update reviews on women-specific barriers to participation into CR programs. One limitation of the previous reviews is that they did not differentiate between barriers for nonparticipation in (never enrolled) and dropout from (attend at least one session and abandon) CR programs. 22,23 This study, therefore, aimed to systematically review the available literature on barriers perceived by women with CVD associated with their nonparticipation in and/ or dropping out from CR programs.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Search strategy and selection of articles", "text": "We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. 24 The methods were specified and registered in a protocol (see Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/jwh) (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, registration No.: CRD42015024956).

Following an ecological health model, barriers were grouped into five large categories: (1) intrapersonal barriers, (2) interpersonal barriers, (3) logistical barriers, (4) CR program barriers, and (5) health system barriers. As shown in Table 3, religious reasons were only reported as a barrier for dropping out from CR. Moreover, barriers reported only for nonparticipation in CR were availability of personal or community resources, lack of referral, negative experiences with the health system, and language.\nIntrapersonal barriers. Intrapersonal barriers included those barriers related to self-reported health, health beliefs, lack of time, lack of motivation, religious reasons, and personal preference.\nSelf-reported health. Women cited multiple selfreported health problems that seemed to interfere with their participation in CR programs. [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]50,51,53 Having poor health or feeling too sick was cited as barriers for nonparticipation. 30,32,39,43 Mochari et al. found that women reported feeling too old or feeling depressed as barriers for nonparticipation in CR. 37 Yates et al. found that women reported being unable to do exercises as a barrier for nonparticipation in CR. 41 Medical problems have also been reported as a barrier for dropout from CR. [46][47][48][50][51][52][53] One study found that the reasons most often given by women for dropout from CR were medical, such as a new cardiac diagnosis and cardiac or pulmonary problems. 47 Barriers such as no desire to go back to the hospital or needing to receive another medical treatment have been reported for nonparticipation. 31,36 Health beliefs. Health beliefs have been reported as barriers for nonparticipation in [30][31][32]34,35,[39][40][41]44 and dropout from CR. 49,50 Specifically for nonparticipation in the programs, different studies found that women perceived CR as unnecessary, 30,32,34,35 that heart attacks cannot be prevented, 44 not having a heart problem, or that CR will not make a difference. 39,40 With respect to beliefs that women could manage or solve their heart problem by themselves, this has been reported as a barrier both for nonparticipation in 31,35,41 and for dropout from CR. 49,50 Lack of time. Time constraints have been reported as barriers for both nonparticipation in 30,31,34,37,40 and dropout from CR. 50,51,53 Allen et al. found that women reported being too busy to enroll in CR. 30 Lack of motivation. Several authors found lack of interest or motivation as barriers for nonparticipation in 31,32,37,41,45 or dropping out from CR. 48 Religious reasons. Religious reasons have been reported in one study as a barrier for dropout from CR. 53 These authors found that women reported religious expectations as reasons for dropping out from the program. Lack of family and social support. This barrier has been reported for both nonparticipation in [32][33][34][35][37][38][39][40]42,45,50 and dropout from CR. 48,50 Studies of the past decade report more frequently this barrier. 35,37,39,40,45,48,50 Several studies found that women reported family obligations 34,35,43,45 and multi-ple role conflicts. 32 Women also reported caretaking responsibilities as a barrier for either nonparticipation in or dropping out from CR. 35,48,50,52 Lieberman et al. found that women may feel guilty about having less time for family as a barrier to participation in CR. 38 Work conflicts. Different authors found that women reported work conflicts or employment restrictions as barriers both for not participating in 34,35,37,[39][40][41][42]45 and for dropping out from CR. [46][47][48]50 Work conflicts have been mainly reported in studies of the last decade. 35,37,39,40,45,48,50 Logistical barriers. Logistical barriers include those related to transport problems, distance and location, and availability of personal or community resources.\nTransport barriers. Different studies found that women reported not having transport as a barrier to participation in CR [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]45,50,53 and for dropping out from CR. [46][47][48]50 Transport barriers have mostly been found in non-U.S. studies. 30,36,37,41,43,[45][46][47] Women also cited having problems parking, 39 not driving, or not wanting to disturb a relative as barriers for nonparticipation in CR. 43,50 Distance. Several studies found that women reported that CR was too far away as a barrier both for nonparticipation in 31,[33][34][35]40,45,51,52 and for dropping out from CR. 50,51 Distance has mostly been found in non-U.S. studies. 31,[33][34][35]40,50 Several women reported that the CR program was in an inconvenient location as a barrier for nonparticipation. 33,37 Availability of personal or community resources. Regarding resources, women reported having home or community exercise participation as reasons for nonparticipation in CR. [34][35][36][39][40][41] Perceptions about CR programs. Perceptions about the CR program include those barriers related to the services offered, group format, exercise component, and CR sessions.\nServices offered. Two studies found that women reported that the program services were not adapted to their necessities as a barrier for both nonparticipation in 32,50 and dropping out from CR. 50 This barrier has only been found in non-U.S. studies.\nGroup format. Women reported not being comfortable talking in groups or not wanting to listen to others' problems as barriers for both nonparticipation in 31 and dropping out from CR. 50 Also, women reported that CR was tailored to the needs of older people, 50 feeling uncomfortable, 31 or feelings of embarrassment as reasons for nonparticipation. 39,42,53 This barrier has only been found in non-U.S. studies and more frequently reported in studies of past decade. 39,50,53 Exercise component. Women found exercise physically too heavy, tiring, or painful as barriers for nonparticipation in 35,40 and for dropping out from CR. 50,51 Grace et al. found that women reported being frightened of exercise as a reason for nonparticipation in CR. 33 CR sessions. Duration and number of sessions of CR have been considered barriers for nonparticipation in CR. 33,38 Moreover, women reported inconvenient timing of the program as a barrier for dropping out. 50 ", "n_publication_ref": 199, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BARRIERS FOR NONPARTICIPATION AND DROPOUT", "text": "Health system barriers. Health system barriers include lack of referral, cost, referral to another CR program, negative experiences with the health system, and language.\nLack of referral. Lack of referral to CR has been reported as a barrier only for nonparticipation in CR. [30][31][32][33][34][35]37,39,40,50 This barrier only appeared in two U.S. studies. 30,37 Several studies found that women reported their physician felt it unnecessary to refer them to CR. 31,32,35,39,50 Allen et al. found that the most common reason given by female participants for not participating in CR was lack of a referral from their physician. 30 Related to this, one study found that women reported having to wait too long to get referred or that the CR staff did not contact them as barriers for nonparticipation. 40 Finally, women reported not being aware of CR as a barrier to participation. 34,35,39,40 Cost. Different studies pointed out that women reported the cost of CR or the cost of going to CR as barriers for nonparticipation. 30,[33][34][35]40,45 Lack of insurance and financial reasons were reported as barriers for nonparticipation in CR (60% U.S. studies). [36][37][38]43,50 In one study, women reported that they ''do not want to use their money that they may need for other things'' as a reason for nonparticipation in CR. 39 Only one study found that women cited that the cost of the program was too high as a reason for dropping out from the program. 50 Negative experiences with the health system. Having negative experiences with the health system was cited in one study as a barrier for nonparticipation in CR. 53 Language. Several studies found communication difficulties as a barrier for participation in CR. 34,35,37,53 For example, in two studies women reported that the program was not offered in their first language. 34,35 Language barriers appeared more frequently in past decade studies. 35,37,53 ", "n_publication_ref": 46, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Main results", "text": "This study is the first, to our knowledge, to provide a comprehensive overview of differential barriers for nonparticipation in and dropout from CR based on female populations.\nConsistent with previous reviews, our systematic review found barriers such as intrapersonal barriers, lack of family support, health system barriers, and perceptions of the CR program. 19,22,23 However, we also found new barriers that have not appeared in previous reviews. Women reported lack of motivation as a barrier for both nonparticipation in and dropping out from a CR program. We also found that women reported work conflicts as a barrier mainly for dropping out from the program.\nWith respect to differential barriers for nonparticipation and dropout, religious reasons were cited as a barrier only for dropout from the CR program. It is possible that women face religious conflicts with some of the CR components, such as exercising in front of others, causing them to dropout from CR programs. Regarding specific barriers for nonparticipation, we found that women reported having personal and community resources, lack of referral and endorsement by their physician, negative experiences with the health system, and language barriers.\nWe found that self-reported health was a barrier cited for both nonparticipation in and dropping out from CR. This barrier has appeared in a previous review only for not completing the CR. 17 According to the literature, women with CVD tend to have more comorbidities and are older. 21,22 The treatment of comorbid health problems and the adaptation of CR components to medical needs may promote adherence to CR and prevent dropout from the programs. Related to this, depression has been found to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with CVD. 54 We found that depression was reported as a specific barrier for nonparticipation, 37 similar to previous reviews that found psychological well-being was related to participation in CR. 13,19 With the objective of promoting participation in CR, one potential improvement could be to include a psychological assessment and counseling before the program, much like depression screening already recommended in prevention guidelines. 55 Interpersonal barriers appeared more frequently in past decade studies. This result may show a differential trend in women's roles that may be difficult for their participation in CR. Similar to the present systematic review, other reviews have identified that women with less social support, less family support, and a caregiver role were less likely to participate in CR. 19,22 Women are more likely to be caregivers than men, and this role might make participation in CR programs more difficult. Moreover, community evaluation including family conditions and cultural needs may enhance participation, adapting the program to diverse women's needs. Related to this, further studies including minority women are necessary to know whether they experience different cultural and language barriers to CR.\nTransport problems, distance, and geographical location have been largely reported in the literature. 13,19,22 Specifically in our review, these logistical issues have been reported as barriers both for nonparticipation in and for dropping out from CR. Improved access to CR as well as to public transportation is needed to promote the participation in and prevent the dropout of women from CR programs. Specifically, we found that insurance problems appeared more frequently in women from U.S. studies and cost for parking or transportation in non-U.S. studies. Despite some healthcare systems ensure minimal costs for CR participation, to facilitate access to CR programs by women with financial problems or without insurance, policy recommendations should incorporate measures to reduce the cost of transportation or offer alternative CR programs, such as home-based or online programs. 56 In accordance with previous reviews, 16,17,22 we found that women reported being unaware of CR, lack of referral, and receiving low medical encouragement to participate in the programs. As noted in previous studies, women present a different cardiovascular risk profile that might lead the provider to be unable to determine whether those women are appropriate for CR. 22,57 Different studies suggest that automatic referral to CR could improve the enrollment rate of women in these programs. 9,58,59 We found that the cost of the program has been reported as a barrier for nonparticipation in CR programs, but this barrier has also been cited for dropping out from CR. Although previous reviews only found cost barriers in studies carried out in the United States, 22,23 we found cost barriers in studies from other countries (e.g., United States, Belgium, and Canada). Consistent with previous reviews, 13,19 we observed that women mostly disliked group-based rehabilitation sessions or preferred to use exercise equipment at home. 22 Surprisingly, our systematic review found that women primarily reported perception of CR program barriers for nonparticipation in a CR program. As women reported these barriers mainly for nonparticipation in the program, it may be that women have the view that CR is organized only around the exercise component and are unaware that CR is multicomponent. As women reported availability of personal and community resources as barriers for nonparticipation, CR adherence may be enhanced if community and personal resources are considered during the organization of these programs. Doing so would allow women to perform the exercise component with their own resources, while benefitting from the group components of CR such as risk factor management or psychosocial and nutritional counseling.\nFinally, the findings of our systematic review highlight that there are different barriers faced by women in U.S. and non-U.S. studies. More studies from different countries (e.g., Europe or Asia) are necessary to corroborate whether women face different barriers to CR participation. Moreover, to acquire a deeper knowledge about the perceptions of women toward CR, more qualitative studies evaluating the barriers for nonparticipation in or dropping out from the programs are needed.

assessment of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and geriatric participants in clinical trials through regulations and guidance documents. This study surveyed the demographics of clinical trial participants and the presence of efficacy and safety analyses by sex for new drugs approved between 2013 and 2015 by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Methods: New drug marketing applications submitted to FDA were surveyed for demographic data (sex, race, ethnicity, and age) and the presence of sex-based analyses for efficacy and safety. The Ratio of the Proportion of women in clinical trials for the indicated disease population relative to the estimated Proportion of women in the disease population (PPR) was calculated for new drug indications. Results: Of the 102 new drugs in this cohort (defined as new molecular entity drugs and original therapeutic biologics), sex was reported for >99.9% of trial participants, and women accounted for 40.4% of these participants. An estimated 77.2% of participants were White, 6.4% were Black/African American, and 29.1% were aged \u202165 years. Sex-based analyses for both efficacy and safety were conducted for 93.1% of applications. PPR was calculated for 82 new drugs for a total of 60 indications, of which 50 indications (83.3%) had a PPR \u20210.80. Conclusions: Sex data are now collected for almost all study participants, and this study shows appropriate sex participation for most new drugs when estimated disease prevalence by sex (PPR) is considered. Therapeutic area and disease indication are important considerations when assessing the sex of participants because variation occurs depending on the disease under study. Some racial minorities, especially Blacks/African Americans, are still not well represented in most drug development programs and remain an area where improvement is needed.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A dequate assessment of men and women in clinical trials is essential for the identification of potential sex differences in a drug's efficacy and safety. Several known examples of sex differences in the treatment effects associated with drugs have been incorporated into drug labeling. 1,2 Some differences in the way men and women respond to drugs may be due to anatomical differences, such as body weight. 3 Women are also more likely than men to experience QT prolongation and related ventricular arrhythmias while taking some medications. 4,5 One drug, amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker used for treating hypertension, causes more drug-and dose-related adverse events in women than in men. 6,7 Several drugs require a lower starting dose in women, as pharmacokinetic (PK) sex differences cause variations in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). [8][9][10] For example, administration of zolpidem, indicated for the treatment of insomnia, resulted in higher levels of zolpidem in women the next morning. Because women eliminated zolpidem more slowly, this difference led to a greater risk of next-morning driving impairment. 11 This finding is reflected in the labeling, where a lower initial dose is recommended for women. 12 Similarly, flurazepam, a sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant for the treatment of insomnia, was found to have lower clearance in women, and, thus, flurazepam also has a lower recommended initial dose for women. 13 The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews demographics of clinical trial participants and subgroup analyses during its regulatory assessment of new drug and biological product (''drug'') marketing applications. The information from these clinical trials is used to support regulatory decisions (e.g., approvals, nonapprovals) for drug applications. Drugs that are approved may then be prescribed for use in a larger, more diverse population than is typically exposed to the drug during premarket clinical development. Over the years, the FDA has published regulations and guidance for industry about expectations regarding the need for diverse enrollment in clinical trials and the conduct of sex analyses. 10,14,15 Other demographic subgroups-specifically, race, ethnicity, and age-may also contribute to differences in disease response and in response to drugs (e.g., the drug effect). For example, in a Veterans Administration Cooperative Group study on anti-hypertensives, several classes of antihypertensive agents were found to be not as effective in Black/ African American patients. 16 More recently, studies looking at the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in patients with advanced heart failure demonstrated increased survival in Black/African American patients. 17,18 Collection of race and ethnicity data is encouraged for FDAregulated products in the 2016 guidance, Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials. 19 Age has also been found to be an important factor in the response to drugs. The FDA has required age data to be reported in New Drug Applications (NDAs) since 1985. 20 Beginning in 2006, the FDA has required the inclusion of specific sections in approved drug labeling for special populations, such as pediatric (0-16 years) and geriatric ( \u202165 years) populations. 21 Information, such as dosing adjustments, regarding recommendations for certain age groups, may be available in the ''Pediatric Use'' and ''Geriatric Use'' sections of labeling.\nGuidance has also been published regarding the conduct of subgroup analyses used to support NDAs. A 1989 guidance specifically recommended analysis of safety and effectiveness data by age, 22 and a 1993 guidance on the study and evaluation of gender differences, similarly recommended such analyses by sex. 10 Both restated prior guidelines from 1988 for the format and content of efficacy and safety analyses in clinical trials. 23 This 1988 guideline recommended addressing PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) differences in different demographic subgroups and for various patient characteristics (e.g., renal function). 23 Differences between patients in response to a drug can be the result of variation in the PK (the drug's ADME in the body), variation in the PD (the drug's effect on the body), or other factors for which there are known demographic differences. 2,3,8,9 In 1998, the FDA issued a final rule on investigational new drug (IND) applications and NDAs (the ''Demographic Rule''), which required the analyses of efficacy and safety data for important demographic subgroups in NDAs. 14 The Demographic Rule also required that the enrollment of participants in clinical trials for drugs be calculated for key demographic subgroups in IND annual reports. 14 The FDA continues to work on improving both data collection and analysis of demographic subgroups in clinical trials.\nIn August 2013, the FDA released a report to Congress describing demographics and subset analyses included in 72 applications for drugs, biologics, and medical devices approved in 2011. 24 This report was congressionally mandated as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Section 907. 25 Subsequently, the FDA published an action plan with recommendations for improving the completeness and the quality of data analyses on demographic subgroups, and for including these analyses in product labeling and in information distributed to patients and healthcare providers. 26,27 The participation of demographic subgroups in clinical trials submitted to support drug applications has been periodically studied by the FDA and other organizations, such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). [28][29][30][31][32][33] These previous studies have noted improvements compared with the 1992 GAO report 28 in the percentage of women enrolled in clinical trials and the conduct of sex analyses, but they have also identified areas in which the percentage of women is lower than expected based on prevalence estimates of the disease.\nOur descriptive, retrospective study is an update on the status of the participation of demographic subgroups in all clinical trials (phases 1, 2, and 3) submitted to support the approval of new drugs. We use the term ''new drugs'' to refer to new molecular entity (NME) drugs and original therapeutic biologics that have been approved by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) between 2013 and 2015. This study also assessed compliance with the 1998 Demographic Rule requiring sponsors to submit sexbased efficacy and safety analyses in applications for new drugs. 14 To assess trends in the percentages of women, minorities, and geriatrics participating in clinical trials, this study compared findings for the years 2013-2015 with those of previous studies.

Drugs approved for sex-specific (n = 6) or predominantly pediatric (n = 5) indications were excluded. Clinical trials for the remaining new drugs that included only pediatric patients were also excluded because pediatric populations are covered under different legislation. Products approved by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, such as blood products and vaccines, were not reviewed.\nDrug indications were obtained from drug labeling found on the Drugs@FDA website. 35 Abbreviated indications were abstracted from the drug labeling and may not have been representative of the full indication.

Hispanic/Latino was not consistently reported in study demographics-it was reported as a race category, an ethnicity category, or not at all. If reported as an ethnic group, then the three possible categories were, ''Hispanic/Latino,'' ''Not Hispanic/Latino,'' or ''Unknown (reported).''

The estimated prevalence is the number of cases of disease in a population at risk for the disease. Because prevalence was not always available, incidence, the number of newly diagnosed cases, was estimated when available.\nThe prevalence or incidence data by sex were reported in these sources in various forms, sometimes as prevalence rate or incidence rate, which is the percent of prevalence or incidence cases divided by the population at risk. Sources were identified by using keyword searches that included ''woman,'' ''women,'' ''female,'' ''sex,'' ''gender,'' ''prevalence,'' ''incidence,'' ''demographics,'' or ''epidemiology,'' and disease names or procedures. The most recently published source was utilized when possible.\nIf prevalence information was unavailable for relapsed or refractory populations with the disease or for genetic or molecularly defined subsets, then estimated prevalence for the more general indication was used. Data from studies conducted in North America and Europe were preferred to best estimate prevalence. 32,33 For new drugs indicated for disease symptoms, estimated prevalence or incidence data were found for the underlying disease.

Because >35% of participants were missing ethnicity data, the percent participation can only be used to describe those who reported their ethnicity; therefore, these percentages may not reflect actual participation of the entire study population. Participation by age group: Age group (defined as <65 years, \u202165 years) was reported for 350,064 (72.2%) of trial participants. By year, reporting rates were 43.8% in 2013, 82.0% in 2014, and 79.2% in 2015.

The percentage of women varied considerably by indication and therapeutic grouping (Fig. 2). When the participation of women was examined as an estimated proportion of women in the disease population (PPR), 83.3% of the newly approved indications examined in this study had participation of women in the clinical trials supporting the drug's approved indication that was similar to or greater than the estimated proportion of women in the disease population for that indication (i.e., PPR >0.8) (Fig. 3).  31 January 2000 to December 2002 Phases 1, 2, and 3 48.5 70.7 a Poon et al. 32 January 2007 to December 2009 Late-phase trials b 44.7 72.1 Eshera et al. 33 January a Source is unclear as to whether this is the percent with sex-based analyses of both efficacy and safety versus only one or the other. b Defined late-phase clinical trials as phase 3 and some late phase 2 studies that generally confirm the efficacy outcome and safety profiles of a drug or biologic product in the targeted patient population.\nc Defined pivotal clinical trials as those phase 2 and/or 3 trials described in the medical and statistical reviews or the product labeling as supporting the drug or biological approval.\nU.S. GAO, United States General Accounting Office. A trend toward higher participation of women in later phase trials than in phase 1 was seen (Fig. 4a) and is not unexpected. Phase 2 and 3 trials are typically conducted in the indicated disease population, and phase 3 trials are usually the largest and longest trials, designed and conducted for the purpose of demonstrating the benefits and risks of the drug in the population for which the drug is labeled for use in the postmarketing period. Therefore, later phase trials are expected to more closely approximate the population with the disease than early phase trials, which are typically conducted mainly for safety and PK/PD exploration.\nCompliance with Federal regulations for demographic reporting of sex in patient-level data submitted to the FDA by drug sponsors was high, with sex demographic subgroup data having been reported for virtually all of the clinical trial participants (>99.9%). By comparison, a 2001 GAO report found that sex was unknown for 9% of trial participants. 29 Further, the percentage of submissions by sponsors that included sexbased analyses for both safety and efficacy (93.1%) was higher than what was observed in earlier studies (Table 3). Since 2015, the FDA has also been enhancing the reporting of demographics of participants in the clinical trials that support regulatory decisions via publication of these data on the FDA's ''Drug Trials Snapshots'' website in an effort to increase agency transparency so that this information can be directly communicated to the public. 27 The increased reporting of participant age (<65 years, \u202165 years) in 2015 and 2014 compared with 2013 may be due to the 2012 amendment to the International Council for Harmonisation E-7 guidance, which emphasized the importance of including patients \u202165 years of age. 36 Analysis of phase 3 data showed that the percentage of trial participants with ages \u202165 years increased from 19% to 40% from 2013 to 2015 (Fig. 4b); however, this increase is based on a limited sample of drugs surveyed in the 3-year study period, and no definite conclusions regarding percent participation for older patients can be drawn. The therapeutic groupings with the greatest percentage of trial participants \u202165 years of age were Oncology/Nononcology Hematology, Medical Imaging, and Cardiovascular/Renal (Fig. 5), which is likely due to cancer (oncology), cognitive decline (medical imaging), and heart conditions (cardiovascular) being more prevalent in older patients.\nFor race and ethnicity, the results show that although collection and reporting of race subgroup data by sponsors was high (97.5%), collection of ethnicity data was more limited (64.7%) and was inconsistent across applications. Some applications reported ''Hispanic/Latino'' as race, whereas others reported ''Hispanic/Latino'' as ethnicity; thus, there is a possibility that some trials reported race without reporting ethnicity separately. Although this study found 13.3% Hispanic/ Latino participation within the ethnicity subgroup, missing ethnicity data in >35% of participants makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the overall participation by ethnic group in clinical trials.\nThe majority of clinical trial participants surveyed during the study period were White and Not Hispanic/Latino (Table 1). Relative to the U.S. population, the mean percent participation of Asians was high (12.2%), whereas the mean percentage of Blacks/African Americans in clinical trials was lower than anticipated (6.4%). Although the percent participation varied somewhat by disease indication, in most instances, Black/African American participation was generally lower than would be expected based on the percentage of Blacks/African Americans in the U.S. population (13.3%) 37 and estimated percentages in the disease population. This finding is consistent with numerous recent studies in the medical literature and remains an area of drug development in need of improvement. 24,[38][39][40] In contrast to the higher participation of women and older patients in later phase clinical trials, participation of pooled racial minorities was relatively consistent by phase (Fig. 4c). Participation by Hispanic ethnicity for those who reported this information also did not show a trend toward higher participation in the later phases (Fig. 4d). The reasons for these trends are not clear; however, previous reports indicate that racial minority participation varies substantially by the geographic location in which these trials are conducted, 30 which may have affected percent participation by race when FIG. 5. Percent geriatric participation in new drug trials by therapeutic grouping.\nassessed by overall clinical trial demographics and by trial phase. Additional assessment of participation by racial and ethnic subgroups is needed and remains an area of additional study.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 8}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the drug approvals included in this cohort were limited to a recent 3-year period. Drug development and approvals can vary substantially from year to year, and they often reflect scientific and pharmaceutical advances within a given period. Because the percent female (and other demographic subgroup) participation varies depending on the disease indication for which the drug is being administered, differences in drugs approved in a limited period may affect the demographic make-up of the clinical trial population.\nSecond, the scope of this study did not expand on clinical trial location, which limited the analytic detail required for conclusions based on the participants' geographic location. Because the majority of applications were multi-national, clinical trials conducted in foreign countries may not reflect the demographics of the United States and limited conclusions for U.S. participation.\nThird, due to the higher number of participants for whom data on ethnicity and age were missing, it was difficult to draw conclusions on the overall participation in clinical trials by ethnicity and age. Also, some sponsors collected Hispanic/ Latino as a race category, and this might have added to the lower number of patients reporting it under ethnicity.\nFourth, although PPR is more informative than %CT alone (as it corrects for differences in disease prevalence by sex), there are limitations to the use of PPR. 32,33 PPR sources only provide estimates of the sex prevalence by disease. When an indication is very narrow or specific, it may be difficult to identify epidemiologic data on a similar patient population. For instance, although prevalence information may be available for a general indication, it may not be available for relapsed or refractory populations with the disease or for genetic or molecularly defined subsets.\n''Precision medicine,'' where drugs are increasingly being developed for underlying disease-related targets (e.g., mutationally defined tumors for cancer drugs), is an increasing area of drug development, and estimates of the disease prevalence in these narrow patient populations can be difficult to define. One example is that the demographics of the population affected by nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resulting from an anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) mutation 41 may be different from the demographics of the population affected by NSCLC resulting from an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation, 42 or even from the overall NSCLC population. 43 Another example is refractory gout. The lowest PPR calculated in this study was for gout (0.2), with a %CT of 4.7% and a %P of 26.5% for women. Gout overall is a malepredominant disease for which prevalence estimates are available 44 ; however, the drug included in this study was indicated for refractory gout, which is expected to be an overwhelmingly male disease, but for which reliable sexprevalence data are not available. Hence, percent women in this specific disease population was likely overestimated, which may, in part, have contributed to the low PPR.\nSimilar difficulties in estimating disease and demographic subpopulations are also seen for some orphan drugs, which are approved for rare diseases and disorders affecting <200,000 people in the United States, 45 and in some cases, have little epidemiologic data available in the published literature.\nDisease prevalence estimates by demographic subgroup may also vary in different parts of the world, which may have affected both the demographic composition of the clinical trials 30 and the calculation of PPR because disease prevalence estimates were based predominantly on prevalence in Western nations 32,33 ; however, even among Western nations or among different regions within the United States, disease prevalence may be variable.\nIn this study, >95% of the approved drugs had clinical development programs that were supported by results from multi-national trials; two drugs (miltefosine for leishmaniasis and ivabradine for congestive heart failure) relied entirely on foreign trials to support approval, and one drug (metreleptin for leptin deficiency) relied entirely on trials conducted in the United States.\nOne example of demographic differences by geographic region is COPD. COPD in the United States is a femalepredominant disease, 46 but it is male predominant in some other regions of the world. 47 For the three COPD drugs included in this study, the percent female participation in the trials conducted in the United States was similar to the percent of women with COPD in the U.S. population; however, the PPR was found to be low (0.5) when the multi-national clinical trial populations were pooled (Fig. 3), which may have been due to an over-estimation of the female prevalence in the multi-national populations in which the trials were conducted.\nFinally, the statistical variability in mean PPR by therapeutic grouping is influenced by the number of drugs approved by the division during the study period (Table 2). Therapeutic groupings with more new drugs approved may give a better assessment of mean PPR and vice versa.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This descriptive, retrospective study demonstrates important current trends in clinical trial demographic data submitted to the U.S. FDA: Sex data are now collected for almost all patients, and there appears to be appropriate sex participation for most new drugs included in this study when estimated disease prevalence by sex (PPR) is considered. We recognize, however, that better data on the prevalence of disease in demographic subsets are needed for some indications, particularly for subsets of diseases (e.g., mutationally defined cancers) and orphan diseases.\nParticipation of some racial minorities-most notably, Blacks/African Americans-is still not well represented in many programs and remains an area in need of improvement. One contributing factor could be that many clinical development programs are now multi-national, and, hence, a large proportion of patients enrolled were from outside the United States where there were fewer Blacks/African Americans. 30 In contrast, Asian participation is now 11%-13%, which is above the percent of Asians in the U.S. population (5.6%). 37 Analyzing demographic data by geographic region could be an area of future research.\nLastly, these data represent a limited 3-year period and are dependent on the indications that received approval during this time. Therefore, in the future, it will be important to look at specific applications when assessing the sex of participants FDA, SEX DISTRIBUTION, DEMOGRAPHY, CLINICAL TRIAL since participation of women is expected to vary depending on the disease under study.

Methods/Design: Twenty-seven female college students (mean age, 21.2; 66.6% white; 66.6% heterosexual) were randomly sampled from university registrar records. To be eligible for the study, students had to have at least one experience of SV/IPV since age 18 and a disability (88.8% reported one or more mental health conditions; 11.1% reported other conditions, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; with the majority of women indicating their disability preceded SV/IPV victimization). Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of SV/IPV as guides, clinically trained master's level interviewers conducted semistructured interviews to ascertain SV/IPV patterns across students' three most recent relationships and related life impacts. Results: SV/IPV was pervasive in college women with a disability, within hookup settings and/or recurring SV/ IPV with a long-term partner. For some women, SV spanned multiple abusive partners. For women in relationships marked by chronic abuse, in addition to SV, the relationship dynamic included disability-specific abuse, social isolation, threats/intimidation, and technology-related abuse. For women experiencing SV events within hookup settings, alcohol was a common facilitator, with some abusers using a disability to manipulate a sexual connection. All but one participant reported exacerbated adverse mental health consequences (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation/attempts, stress) after victimization. These adverse mental health consequences coincided with adverse behavioral (e.g., becoming less social, avoiding usual study lounge areas on campus), physical (e.g., problems sleeping, bruising, pregnancy concerns, and sexually transmitted disease), and academic outcomes (e.g., skipping and/or dropping class, grades suffering). Discussion: Our results underscore the need for continued investment in campus programs that improve response to SV/IPV, including prevention programs and support services tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women with underlying mental health conditions.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "S exual violence (SV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are pressing health issues for women worldwide, 1,2 including on our nation's college campuses. 3,4 Women with disabilities, [4][5][6][7][8][9] including those with physical, mental, or emotional conditions, are at particularly high risk. Using U.S. national data, Breiding and Armour 6 showed that compared with women without a disability, women with life-limiting physical, mental, or emotional conditions are at increased risk for all six types of SV/IPV, including rape, SV other than rape, physical violence and stalking, psychological aggression, and reproductive/sexual health control. Basile et al. 7 further showed that 39% of those women had a disability at the time of their rape.\nIPV/SV risk is also elevated for college students/women with a disability. 4,5,8,[10][11][12][13][14] As many as one in five college students with a disability experienced past-year abuse, with nearly two-thirds experiencing sexual/physical violence before college. 10 In one of the most comprehensive studies, to date, Scherer et al. used the National College Health Assessment (NCHA) data to show that college women with a disability were at increased risk for IPV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.93) compared with those women without a disability. 11 Furthermore, compared with other women, women with a disability had higher prevalence of all types of IPV measured in the study (psychological, 18.76% vs. 10.40%; physical, 4.77% vs. 1.99%; sexual, 4.21% vs. 1.48%).\nOther studies examined the impact of specific types of disability on SV risk in college women. For example, Hossain et al. used NCHA data to show that having a depression diagnosis, specifically, increased college women's risk of SV (odds ratio [OR], 1.56), even after controlling for other risk behaviors. 12 Snyder further showed, through the NCHA data, that having an attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis significantly increased the risk of SV in college women; specifically, rape (AOR, 1.85) and unwanted sexual touching (AOR, 1.41). 13 Consistent with studies of SV/IPV-victimized adult women with disabilites, 9 poor mental health is amplified for IPV-victimized college students/women with a mental disability (OR, depression: 4.64; OR, self-harm: 4.05) or multiple disabilities (OR, depression: 3.36; OR, self-harm: 3.81) compared with victimized students without a disability. 5 Compared with women without a disability victimized by IPV, women with a disability who were victimized by IPV had increased odds of internal depressive symptoms (AOR, 2.87), external depressive symptoms including suicidal attempts and self-harm (AOR, 3.02), and stress (AOR, 1.93). 11 Despite valuable information from prior studies, two gaps exist in the literature. First, little is known about how college women with a disability potentially experience abuse across multiple abusive partners, including abuse targeting women's disability (e.g., name calling, intimidation, and other psychological abuse targeting one's disability). 10,15,16 Second, although mental health is compromised in IPV/SVvictimized women with a disability, 11 less is known about the potential co-occurring impacts of IPV/SV across mental health and other life domains, including physical/health, [17][18][19][20] behavioral, and academic outcomes.\nIntersectionality theory 21,22 helps to explain the ways in which the intersecting experiences of identifying as female and having a disability might amplify risk of SV/IPV victimization, including risk of abuse specifically targeting a disability. Within our patriarchal society, whereby men hold positions of power and have authority over women, sexual scripts tend to fall along traditional gender lines, 23 with men as sexual initiators/aggressors and women as gatekeepers. 23,24 Patriarchy also establishes the context for sexually objectifying and perpetrating violence against women. [25][26][27] Women with a disability have the added vulnerability associated with negative attitudes/stigma, isolation/disconnection from services, and diminished self advocacy, 28 making them potentially more vulnerable than other women to SV/IPV victimization experiences. 7,9 This includes abusers using the interlocking abuse strategies-such as psychological abuse, social isolation, and intimidation-outlined in the Power and Control Wheel, 25 to turn women's disability against them. For example, abusers might call their partner names such as ''bipolar,'' ''crazy,'' and ''lunatic,'' tell their partner she is undesirable because of her mental health condition, and belittle her for using therapy and/or needing medication. With prolonged exposure, women experience constant perceived threat, eroded identity, disempowerment, and entrapment, 27 which increase their susceptibility to repeat victimization and poor outcomes. It has been established in noncollege samples that women with a disability are at increased risk of abuse in general compared with other women, 6,7,9 as well as abuse that targets their disability specifically. 15,16 This study is oriented toward questions about the dual vulnerability of women with a disability in risk of SV/IPV across multiple partners and resulting outcomes. We address questions about (1) how college women with a disability experience SV/IPV victimization across multiple abusive partners, including disability-specific abuse and (2) how SV/ IPV victimization impacts women with a disability across psychological, behavioral, physical, and academic life domains. Although we did not set out to recruit women with any one type (or types) of disability, women who were selected into our study were those with mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and behavioral (e.g., ADHD) conditions. College women are the focus because this developmental period emphasizes explorations of love, sexuality, and intimacy, 29 providing rich information on critical developmental processes that set the stage for adult relationships. Our study adds information about what is needed, nationwide, to continue improving campus programs for SV/IPV, 3 including prevention programs and support services tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women with underlying mental health conditions.", "n_publication_ref": 56, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participant recruitment and characteristics", "text": "Study procedures were approved by the university's institutional review board. Subjects, ages 18 to 24 years, were randomly sampled from the university's registrar records to complete a brief online eligibility screen to ascertain the presence of a disability and SV/IPV.

After coding the first three transcripts together, we revised the coding manual to clarify definitions, rules, and examples. Using the revised coding manual, two study members read each participant's transcript, coded themes, and included narrative examples (i.e., transcript text) associated with the themes. Weekly in-person meetings (A.B., E.N., R.K., and T.G.) were used to compare and resolve minor discrepancies in coded themes. From these efforts, we created a final table that reflected themes. As an additional validity step, 34 the themes were discussed, on two separate occasions, with campus partners to inform our interpretation and assess consistency with their experiences as direct service providers (see Acknowledgments section).\nIn the coding process, we documented SV, including (1) rape with physical force, (2) rape with verbal intimidation/ pressure, (3) rape with alcohol/drug use (with loss of consciousness), ( 4) unwanted sexual contact, and (5) unwanted sexual experiences without physical contact. 31 Physical violence included the use of physical force to harm.

A visual snapshot of data patterns is given in Table 2.\nSV is pervasive in college women with a disability SV was pervasive in college women with a disability, within hookup (casual sex) settings 23 and/or recurring SV with a long-term partner. For some women, their SV victimization spanned multiple abusive partners. For example, one participant with bipolar disorder described three relationships involving SV: two involved SV during hookups (attempted rape/oral sex, and rape with verbal intimidation) and the third involved SV with a long-term boyfriend (coerced oral sex and touching). Another participant with anxiety, depression, and PTSD similarly described three relationships involving SV: two relationships involved SV during hookups (unwanted sexual contact, rape with physical force and verbal intimidation) and the third involved ongoing unwanted sexual contact with a long-term partner.\nSV in hookups. For women experiencing a SV event within the hookup context, nearly all events involved alcohol and verbal intimidation, with occasional physical force. For example, in a 2-week hookup relationship involving SV, a participant with bipolar disorder described alcohol use and verbal intimidation: ''Initially, he pressured me into sex very early on and it was a lot inappropriate touching . and there was definitely alcohol involved and I think it fueled a lot of it on his part . kept saying 'What have I done to not deserve this' . he was just like 'You need to understand how this works' and 'This is what is going on' . and so, he really like intimidated me .''\nThe same participant described a similar SV event occurring the year before, in which her abuser bought her drinks and took her back to his house, where she lost consciousness. The experience of being taken to an isolated location and losing consciousness was an experience reported by other women in the sample:\n''I felt that consent was not given at all because I was very, very drunk at the time . I only remember flashes of what happened . I just remember being at a bar with friends and being really drunk and he kept buying me drinks . I remember like making out on the dance floor with him just cuz    like . I don't know. Then we all got in the car and went to his place . and I remember kinda making out and then, um, my clothes coming off and then I just kinda blacked out.''\nAnother participant, whose abuser isolated her at a friend's house after meeting at a party, described SV involving alcohol, verbal intimidation, and indications of physical force:\n''I was really, really drunk . and like, I just woke up really late and . noticed someone was in the bed with me . and, um he had like his hands in my pants and was like putting his fingers in me . and I pulled his hand out and I shoved him. And he was like, got pissed and was like, 'Come on, are you going to give me blue balls, are you gonna' leave me blue balls' . And then in the morning, I went to the bathroom and there was blood . there was like scratches . And, I looked at my legs where the holes were [in my hose] and there were like scratches on my thighs . I went home and took my clothes off and there were scratches. Like, all over my legs.'' With SV occurring within hookups, some abusers used aspects of a disability to manipulate an emotional connection. For example, one abuser insisted the participant not be alone after she drank and took prescription drugs: ''And, you know, obviously you don't mix those [Xanax and vodka], but I did. And then so he called me that night, and at that point I just sounded like a mess, then so he offered to come, you know, get me, you know 'you shouldn't be alone,' so I did, you know, accept the offer . I just like blacked out you know at some point, and so, when I woke up he was on top of me, he was having sex with me, and, um, I remember it really hurt. So I said to him stop, what are you doing, no.''\nIn another example, a participant said her abuser manipulated an emotional connection with her before unwanted sexual contact by linking his own depression diagnosis with hers, a pattern that has been observed in prior IPV studies involving adults: 35 ''He had also just been diagnosed with depression . so we were on the same medication and I think he was sort of using that as a, as a way to uh, sort of like common ground like uh sort of trying to relate to me.'' SV in ongoing/longer term relationships. For women in longer term abusive relationships, SV tended to be ongoing and typically involved verbal intimidation and in some cases physical force (along with other elements of IPV/ abuse described in the following section). For example, a participant with anxiety disorder and depression described repeated SV experiences involving verbal intimidation in her 6-year relationship:\n''He would tell me things like I had to do certain things cause that's what girlfriends do and then um he would come up and visit me every so often and that's when he forced me to do like sexual acts and all that, and like I didn't want to do it, but he would always say like 'Oh, well you're supposed to do it, that's what my friends are doing, you should be wanting to do this' and then he would like play a mind game . pretending to get really depressed and upset about it and pretending to have really low self-esteem, so I'd be like 'Okay', and I would do it just to kind of make him feel better and that kind of went on for years .'' Another participant, with anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and an eating disorder, described how her physically and psychologically abusive boyfriend routinely intimidated her to participate in anal sex:\n''[I would tell him] I don't like this [anal sex]. This is really painful. He was like 'Yeah, well when we're doing it you secretly like it' . He would jokingly pin me down . to him it was a joke, I would like laugh about it for a second and then I would like seriously I was like 'Ok, stop like no, no, no that really hurts, like don't do that' . and he would start out by trying to have regular sex with me, then in the middle of that he would try and like switch it up . I was like 'Stop, no, no .''' IPV/abuse in ongoing/longer term relationships Disability-specific abuse. For college women who experienced SV in longer term relationships, other IPV/abuse was commonly present, including disability-specific abuse. Disability-specific abuse manifested in several ways, such as the abuser using disability-specific name calling such as ''crazy, ''bipolar,'' and ''moron''; putting women down because of a disability (e.g., ''[He would say] 'you always get so emotional, you need your safe space'''); saying women are undesirable because of a disability (''He would call me every name in the book [laugh] and uh similar things like 'No one else is going to love you' and like 'I'm all that you're going to ever have .'''); and blaming women's prior sexual victimizations on their disability.\nFor example, a participant with anxiety and depression said her long-term boyfriend routinely reminded her how ''lucky'' she was to be in the relationship and blamed a rape she experienced with another man on her ''anxiety'': ''So when I was still with him . there was a guy on my floor and I actually got raped [laugh] by a guy on my floor during it, so I ended up telling him [my boyfriend] about it . and so, um, he [my boyfriend] kind of used that and said [my anxiety] is the reason it [the rape] happened, it was my fault that it [the rape] happened because my anxiety didn't make me aware of my surroundings . so I guess he did kind of use that [my anxiety] against me, kind of.'' Another participant, with bipolar disorder and a history of suicide attempts, described her boyfriend encouraging her to overdose on prescription medications once he discovered she no longer wanted to be in the relationship: ''At the beginning of the end, he, like when we broke up he started texting me stuff along the lines, like 'You're crazy, take your pills,' um, 'I wish you would try to kill yourself and nobody's there' . He would try to contact me and I would, sometimes I'd answer and sometimes I wouldn't, and I did not. And he said 'I see your mood comes and goes,' um, 'Take your chill pill'.'' Disability-specific abuse tended to be a chronic occurrence. For example, one participant described how her abuser regularly invoked her disability within the context of arguments to intimidate and control:\n''[Using my diagnosis against me] That was kind of repeated thing . especially in an argument, just throwing that against me when he was upset with me, kind of telling other people I was crazy or something like that . I don't know the words he used, but that sort of thing, that I was like too broken or too cold .'' Social isolation, threats/intimidation, technology-related abuse. For women in chronically abusive relationships, in addition to disability-specific abuse and SV, the relationship dynamic included social isolation, threats/intimidation (e.g., threatening suicide or physical harm, damaging personal property), and technology-related abuse. Social isolation, or isolating the victim from family and friends, was typically justified by abusers through jealousy and feigned concern. For example, one participant who was involved in an abusive online relationship shared:\n''There were definitely times where . like, I thought it was kind of flattering at the time cause it was like 'Oooo, he's so jealous, oooo he doesn't like that other boys might like me' . like if I alerted him to the fact that I was going out somewhere sometimes he would get a little bit sulky because I was going to be around other men and it was just like 'Oh, I just wish that I could be with you instead of those guys' . and then it was like validating for me to that that 'Okay, well be safe' you know like 'I worry about you because you're so pretty.''' Social isolation routinely included a technology element, such as abusers demanding pictures to prove where their girlfriends were and who they were with, harassing them via social media, and accusing them of infidelity via text message. For example, one participant described her boyfriend's use of text messaging to socially control/isolate her:\n''[When he would accuse me of cheating on him] . he would say 'Fuck that! You were flirting with him, weren't you? You guys were probably out there making out. [When I was late sending a text to him] he would write, 'Well have fun with your new boyfriend . He would see their names [her friends' names] in my phone, like in a group text or something and he would get, he would explode.''\nIn addition, threats of suicide and other harm, including threats made by technology, were common, with one participant describing a picture of a noose her abuser sent her via text message, insinuating his plans to commit suicide.\nOther abusers used physical intimidation both within and outside of sexual interactions. One participant described her partner's anger as ''his whole physical nature would change, he would get like really shaky and just like clench his fists . he would get loud in front of my friends sometimes, and angry, even in front of my family.'' The participant also said her partner choked her and that their sexual interactions were ''a little too aggressive.'' Finally, as an extension of threats and intimidation, in addition to name calling directed at women's disability (e.g., ''bipolar''), other misogynistic name calling was commonplace (e.g., ''bitch,'' ''whore,'' ''slut'') in these longer term SV/IPV relationships. For example, one abusive boyfriend slammed his girlfriend into walls, threw her wallet into vomit, and routinely called her misogynistic names in public:\n''He would just call me a 'slut,' call me a 'whore' in front of a whole bunch of people. Like 'Go slut around the rest of this party. I don't give a fuck. You're such a whore.''' For some, IPV dynamics continued after the relationship ended. One participant explained that after breaking up with her boyfriend of 6 months, he harassed her for 2 years on social media and by text message, including asking for sexually explicit pictures: ''He had messaged me on every form of social media and he would try to convince me to send him nudes and stuff, and he would text me all the time, and like all the time he would be texting or Facebook messaging, like it would never stop . and he would start diagnosing me with stuff . he would be like you must be really stressed or terribly addicted because you're treating people like shit .'' Consequences: co-occurring mental health, academic, behavioral, and physical impacts All but one participant experienced exacerbated mental health consequences (e.g., depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation/attempts, and stress) associated with SV/IPV victimization. These adverse mental health consequences typically co-occurred with adverse behavioral (e.g., becoming less social, avoiding campus areas: ''.I changed where I studied . I used to study in the lounge in the dorm and I tried to not study there and stay in my room and um avoided the cafeteria a lot .''), physical (e.g., problems sleeping, bruising, pregnancy concerns, and sexually transmitted disease), and academic outcomes (e.g., skipping and/or dropping class, grades suffering). For example, a participant who was raped during a hookup described multiple overlapping mental health, behavioral, physical, and academic consequences:\n''So, self-harming a lot more . uh, a lot of like binging and purging . like a lot [laughs]. Um, suicidal thoughts, um, major depression, anxiety which wasn't there before at all really. Um, and then like PTSD symptoms, like, things like that . I wouldn't go to the cafeteria on certain days cause I like saw him there once and I like figured that I could see him there again. [And physical injury] like tearing. Um. Yeah, things like that and like bruises . Umm. Academics, that was a nightmare. Um. Having trouble sleeping all of the time.'' Another participant with three relationships involving SV (two victimizations that occurred during hookups and one with her long-term boyfriend) said her depression ''got significantly worse,'' she contemplated suicide, and she worried about failing school: ''Uh, I decided [laugh] either, I decided my options were either I was going to fail school, I was going to commit suicide [laugh] or both, so . I was definitely feeling that I, I was only good for sex and I wasn't useful for any other thing and I was just feeling super worthless and blaming myself for everything that had happened.'' Behavioral consequences linked directly to victimization included changes in substance abuse (either an increase or decrease in alcohol use), isolating from usual social groups and/or hanging out with riskier individuals, avoiding campus areas (e.g., I definitely made sure . I never walked [to class] alone . if I was gonna run down to [campus convenient store] or something which was on the other side of the building I wouldn't go alone . and like even doing laundry I didn't want to go alone .), and changing interactions with men (some described less trust and avoidance of men, whereas others described themselves as ''hyper-sexualized,'' including engaging in prostitution). The participant whose boyfriend encouraged her to overdose and kill herself indicated she was diagnosed with PTSD after the relationship, was depressed, anxious, and isolated from her friends, had problems concentrating in class, and started to drink heavily associated with a suicide attempt: phone would start ringing nonstop. So, I drank like three bottles of wine and I overdosed and my sister came and then they took me to the hospital . and then I was hospitalized in the psychiatric unit.'' Women also experienced physical problems resulting from their victimization, including injuries (bruising, scratches, and tearing), physical pain, pregnancy concerns, sexually transmitted disease, and eating problems. Confirming findings in the general literature that reproductive coercion characterizes many abusive relationships, 19 one of our study participants partnered with a sexually, physically, and psychologically abusive boyfriend described pregnancy concerns after being deliberately ejaculated into:\n''He was very angry and it was just like it wasn't normal, it was totally different, and like he like literally like, um, ejaculated into me on purpose, and part of me was like are you trying to get me pregnant so I'm like stuck with you . that was a little scary just for that moment cause it's like just for the fact that somebody could be so angry and do that and then purposely try to get like me pregnant .'' After rape, another participant described weight gain and an overall health decline, along with increased stress, anxiety, and academic problems:\n''Just like I thought, yeah I think, I like my anxiety got worse, I think, like physically, you know, like I was just kind of, you know, emotionally needy, I like gained weight, I think it's just stress levels and eating and not going to class, like all of it together, like I think my health declined.'' Finally, for one participant, the academic-related sanction imposed by the university after she reported her assaultnamely, requiring that she sit on one side of the classroom while her abuser sit on the other (they were in the same academic major)-proved ineffective as it increased her anxiety and she withdrew from class altogether: ''I had extreme academic trouble . withdrew from classes . and I'm still in the process of trying to get a medical withdrawal . the worst part was class because I had a lot of classes with him . I was told like I have the left side of the room and he had the right side of the room, but then that's like the hypervigilance sets in and I can't pay attention because I'm always keeping an eye on him .''", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This study addressed questions about (1) how college women with a disability experience abuse SV and IPV across partners, including disability-specific abuse and (2) how SV and IPV impact the many life domains in women with a disability, including psychological, academic, physical, and behavioral life domains. Regarding the first research question, our results build upon existing SV/IPV studies 4,5,8,[10][11][12][13][14] by indicating that college women with a disability typically experienced SV events within hookup settings and/or recurring SV/IPV with a long-term partner. For the women in our study, SV was pervasive, and for some SV victimization spanned multiple abusive partners. In addition, our study provides new information that women in longer term abusive relationships commonly experienced disability-specific abuse (such as name calling that specifically targeted their disability), along with threats/intimidation, social isolation, and technology-related abuse. For women in our study who experienced SV events within hookups, alcohol was a common facilitator and some abusers used a disability to manipulate a sexual connection.\nRegarding the second research question of how SV and IPV impact the life domains in college women with a disability, our results underscore Scherer et al.'s research 11 noting poor mental health outcomes for IPV-victimized college women with a disability, including depression, stress, and behaviors related to depression, including suicide attempts and other self-harm. The women in our study also reported an increase in other types of mental health symptoms, including anxiety and PTSD. Although our findings confirm mental health outcomes previously documented, 11 our study adds new information about the co-occurrence of mental health outcomes with other adverse behavioral (e.g., becoming less social and avoiding common areas such as college cafeterias), physical (e.g., problems sleeping, bruising, pregnancy concerns, and sexually transmitted disease), and academic outcomes (e.g., skipping and/or dropping class, and grades suffering). Our findings noting the co-occurrence of adverse mental health, behavioral, physical, and academic concerns among college women with a disability accentuate prior research noting a broader range of IPV-related health problems in adult women with a disability. 9 What is more, our study underscores academic challenges faced by SV/IPVvictimized college women with a disability, including discomfort occupying their usual spaces on campus (e.g., study lounges and cafeterias) after SV/IPV, along with being sanctioned to be in the same classroom spaces with their abusers.\nOur study has several limitations. First, although the goal of qualitative research is not generalizability, 34 our participants were predominantly those with mental health conditions. Our results and commentary, therefore, concentrate on women with mental health experiences. Future studies should augment the recruitment of women with a range of mental, cognitive, learning, and physical disabilities. 5,11 Second, although 41 women were eligible and consented to participate, only 27 participated in the interviews. Consistent with the literature, it is possible that those who did not participate in the interviews had more traumatic SV/IPV and disability experiences. 36 We did not collect information on nonrespondents to answer this question. Third, because we focused on women's three most recent relationships, 37 we possibly missed other victimization, which some participants alluded to; future studies could inquire about victimizations across adolescence and college as Smith previously documented. 38 Our study is situated within intersectionality theory 21,22 to understand the ways in which the intersecting experiences of disability and gender amplify risk of SV/IPV victimization and poor health-related outcomes. As added components of intersectionality, our study sample included *33% of women who identified as racial or ethnic minority and 33% who identified as nonheterosexual. Recent literature suggests that college students identifying as deaf or hard of hearing and who identify as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered) are at significantly higher risk of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse than mainstream majority groups. 4,14 Additional studies are needed to more fully explore SV/IPV experiences in college women with a disability who are also affiliated with other nonmainstream identity.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, our findings noting pervasive mental health and related physical, behavioral, and academic concerns among SV/IPV-victimized women with a disability underscore the need for continued investment in campus programs that improve response to SV/IPV, 3 including mental health service access. This could include grouping related SV/IPV and mental health services within comprehensive care settings so that students receive coordinated care with referrals and linkages to community resources, follow-up support, and self-management/care support strategies. 39,40 Moreover, although our study did not focus on the temporal relationship between abuse and disability experiences, approximately three-quarters of the women in our study were diagnosed with a mental health condition before at least one of their SV/IPV experiences. With this in mind, campuses should consider designing prevention programs tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women with underlying mental health conditions. Although these prevention programs are deemed costly, the ensuing costs of SV/IPV victimization are sizable in comparison. [41][42][43] Senn's evidence-based Sexual Assault Resistance Program is one option for prevention programming, which includes four 3-hour units aimed at increasing college women's skills in being able to assess risk from acquaintances, overcome emotional barriers in acknowledging danger, and engage in effective verbal and physical self-defense. 44 In addition to mental health-oriented prevention programming, given that some of the behavioral outcomes reported by victimized women included avoiding certain areas on campus after their sexual assault, campus administrators and program planners must keep in mind that safe spaces for women on campus are vital, must be created, and must be preserved and protected. Toward this end, some campuses have women-only lounges, which afford spaces for women to gather, interact, and study. In addition, considering the dual vulnerability of having a mental health disability and an experience of SV/IPV, in alignment with other researchers, 5,10,11,13 we recommend that campus sexual assault programs collaborate with university disability service units to ensure that this subset of survivors are getting their unique needs met. In addition to supportive spaces and prevention programming tailored for women with disability and underlying mental health conditions, further investment in evidenced-based primary prevention programming, such as Green Dot, 45 is warranted.\nFinally, we recommend that future studies investigate women's experiences with service seeking. Findley et al. reported that college students with a disability were not aware of services available to them on campus concerning SV/ IPV. 10 Many college students with mental health issues do not seek services, 46 and few SV/IPV-victimized students seek police or investigative services. 4 Future studies could explore the service seeking (and nonseeking) pathways and experiences among SV/IPV-victimized college women with a disability.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Tana Fedewa (MSU Sexual Assault Program), Michael Hudson (MSU Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities), Holly Rosen (MSU Safe Place), Kelly Schweda (Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Program), Jessica Norris (Office of Institutional Equity), and Karen Clark (Office for Survey Research) at Michigan State University for their input in the project design, interview guide, and study findings.

This study aims to examine the pregnancy and prenatal care experiences and needs of U.S. mothers with physical disabilities and their perceptions of their interactions with their maternity care clinicians. Materials and Methods: We conducted the first survey of maternity care access and experiences of women with physical disabilities from 37 states. The survey was disseminated in partnership with disability community agencies and via social media and targeted U.S. women with a range of physical disabilities who had given birth in the past 10 years. The survey included questions regarding prenatal care quality and childbirth and labor experiences. Results: A total of 126 women with various physical disability types from 37 states completed the survey. Almost half of the respondents (53.2%) reported that their physical disability was a big factor in their selection of a maternity care provider and 40.3% of women reported that their prenatal care provider knew little or nothing about the impact of their physical disability on their pregnancy. Controlling for maternal demographic characteristics and use of mobility equipment, women who reported that their prenatal care provider lacked knowledge of disability and those who felt they were not given adequate information were more likely to report unmet needs for prenatal care. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest the need for training and education for clinicians regarding the prenatal care needs of women with physical disabilities.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W omen with physical disabilities experience multiple social, economic, and health disparities. 1,2 Women with disabilities also experience high rates of poverty and low access to educational, employment, and other community opportunities and resources. 3 Adults with physical disabilities have also reported important barriers within the healthcare system, including physically inaccessible facilities, lack of needed adaptive equipment (i.e., scales that can accommodate a wheelchair), and gaps in patient-provider communication, as well as higher-than-expected levels of medical mistrust. 4,5 Particular access gaps have been noted in women's healthcare, and women with disabilities are less likely to receive consistent routine reproductive healthcare and gynecological cancer screenings. 6,7 As pregnancy and birth outcomes are intimately tied to such social determinants of health, with disparities noted in populations that lack access to economic, social, and healthcare opportunities, 8,9 the maternity care needs and experiences and outcomes of women with physical disabilities warrant public health attention. 10 Although the exact prevalence of pregnancy among women with physical disability is unknown, it is not insignificant, and likely rising. 11 Although many women with physical disabilities have a positive birth experience and are very satisfied with the quality of their maternity care experience, emerging evidence suggests that women with physical disabilities are at increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, including preterm labor and low birth weight infants. [12][13][14][15] Although questions regarding its efficacy remain, equitable access to adequate and high-quality prenatal care is a wellrecognized public strategy for improving birth outcomes among vulnerable populations, 16 and may be useful for women with disabilities. 17 However, evidence suggests that people with disabilities experience significant gaps in patient-provider communication and perceive patronizing or other negative attitudes from clinicians and medical staff. 18,19 Clinicians often lack education regarding the nonmedical aspects of disability experiences, including the psychosocial needs, experiences, and capabilities of adults with disabilities, as well as the nonclinical challenges they face. 20,21 Without such education, clinicians may hold unconscious negative bias regarding people with disabilities. 22 Clinicians may also lack knowledge about the interaction between specific disabilities and conditions such as pregnancy. 12,23 Specific to reproductive health and maternity care, several qualitative studies report that women with physical disabilities often perceive their clinicians as possessing negative attitudes regarding sexuality, motherhood, and childbearing among people with disabilities. 19,24,25 These perceived attitudes reflect larger social stigmas regarding sexuality and disability, including negative perceptions of pregnancy and motherhood by women with disabilities, and the myth of adults with disabilities as categorically asexual. 26,27 This stigma and lack of knowledge appear to impact prenatal care, as perceived by women with physical disabilities. 19,25,28 For example, a recent qualitative study found that women with physical disabilities perceived that their clinicians lacked knowledge of both their disability in general and its potential interactions with their pregnancy, and struggled to find disability-informed maternity care providers. 15,29 They also reported other barriers, including inaccessible equipment, such as scales and examination tables, and perceived negative attitudes from their clinicians. 15,29 These qualitative findings are supported by the general lack of clinical guidelines related to maternity care of women with physical disabilities. 10,30 Although the qualitative literature suggests that many women with physical disabilities report negative prenatal care experiences, these survey data provide a more comprehensive exploration of prenatal care experiences and needs from the perspective of women with physical disabilities. We, therefore, conducted a survey of access, experiences, and perceived quality of maternity care among U.S. women with physical disabilities. This analysis of the survey data focuses on maternal satisfaction with prenatal care, including women's perceptions of their prenatal care providers and barriers to equitable, high-quality prenatal care.", "n_publication_ref": 38, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Data for this study were derived from the first survey on pregnancy among women with physical disabilities in the United States.

This reaction occurred before their pregnancy with their youngest child. Respondents attributed these perceived negative reactions to concerns about their ability to care for their baby, fear their physical disability would be passed on to their child, concern about maternal harm as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, concern about their ability to carry a pregnancy to term, and concern regarding the effects of disability on pregnancy.\nSlightly less than half of respondents (40.3%) perceived that their prenatal care provider knew only a little or nothing about the impacts of physical disability on pregnancy when they initiated prenatal care.

Although women with physical disabilities who participated in this survey reported fairly positive prenatal care experiences, there were also important gaps and areas of unmet need related to patient-provider relationships and communication. Patient-provider relationships are crucial to maternity care, and parents express preferences for providers who listen well and invest in relationships. 32,33 Trust and communication are thought to be particularly important in maternity care relationships, 32 suggesting a potential mechanism through which unmet prenatal care needs and less than ideal prenatal care experiences may contribute to disparities in maternity care outcomes.\nIn this study, we found high levels of satisfaction with prenatal care among women with physical disabilities. These findings are consistent with those reported in other studies on satisfaction with prenatal care in the overall obstetric population. [34][35][36] Conversely in a qualitative study investigating deaf and hearing women's satisfaction with prenatal care, deaf women reported lower overall satisfaction with their prenatal care than hearing women and were less satisfied with the quality of patient-provider communication. 37 Interestingly, our study demonstrates a disparity between the high levels of prenatal care satisfaction with the reported needs for better patient-provider communication and improved clinician knowledge, information, and accessible provider settings. Notably, over one-third of survey respondents perceived that clinicians held negative or stereotypical beliefs about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by people with physical disabilities. This disparity between satisfaction and unmet needs for information, better communication, and accessible settings can potentially be explained at least, in part, by the theory of Fishbein and Ajzen 38 that satisfaction may be higher despite barriers and problems when expectations are lower. Galle et al. 34 have used a similar approach to explain higher levels of prenatal care satisfaction among women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This survey did not measure care expectations, but this could be an explanation for the high satisfaction despite the unmet needs noted by participants in text entry responses. In other words, when expectations are lower, satisfaction may be higher despite the reported barriers that impeded their access to quality prenatal care.\nThere is compelling evidence from prior studies that maternal experiences of racism, both within and outside of the healthcare system, are associated with adverse infant outcomes in the general population. 39 Furthermore, several qualitative studies show that perceived negative and/or stereotypical beliefs and racist microaggressions by their prenatal care providers decreased trust, satisfaction, and overall perceived maternity care quality among mothers of color. [40][41][42] We theorize that, although experiences of racism and of ableism are not identical, maternal perceived experiences of ableism and negative reactions to pregnancy by clinicians may have similar effects on perceived quality of prenatal care. Further research to test this relationship is recommended.\nIn addition, provision of information to enable informed patient decision-making is considered a crucial element of maternity care, given the personal nature of birth and the wide range of beliefs present among birthing parents. 43 Informed decisionmaking hinges on whether or not maternity care providers both possess relevant clinical knowledge and are able to communicate it effectively to their patients. 43 Survey respondents reported significant unmet informational needs and perceived that their prenatal care providers also had important knowledge gaps related to disability and pregnancy. Unmet information needs and perceived limited clinician knowledge were significantly associated with perceived need for better prenatal care. Notably, these information gaps persisted despite clinician efforts to learn more about how to best care for respondents. These findings reinforce the need for further development of a clinical evidence base related to pregnancy and disability. 10 ", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "There are several limitations to this study. Our convenience sampling strategy limits the generalizability of the findings to a wider population of women with physical disabilities in the United States. The findings of the study are subject to recall and social desirability bias and the biases of self-reported data. Of note, the recall period for mothers with physical disabilities who completed the survey can be as long as 10 years since they gave birth to their youngest child. Similarly, the findings can be subject to selection bias owing to use of purposive sampling strategy. Respondents recruited using social media in partnership with disability-related and other community-based organizations are potentially better connected to disability advocacy groups. In addition, women with particularly negative or positive prenatal experiences may be more motivated to participate in the study.\nDespite rather extensive national recruitment efforts, we obtained a relatively small sample size (n = 126). The authors speculate that factors contributing to this limited sample size could be lack of access to or participation in social media and technology or reluctance to participate due to fear of children getting taken away. 24,44,45 The study sample consisted of mostly white, higher income, married mothers with high levels of education and with private health insurance. This is in contrast to the general population of reproductive-age women with chronic physical disabilities in the United States. 11 Using population-based data, Iezzoni et al. 11 found that reproductive-age women with high severity of chronic physical disabilities were less likely to have private health insurance, less likely to be married, and have lower levels of education. Therefore, the findings of this study may not reflect the experiences of general population of women with physical disabilities with fewer economic and educational opportunities, as well as racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities with disabilities. The prenatal experiences for the general population of women with significant physical disabilities are likely worse. We acknowledge that this is an important gap, given the lack of research exploring the maternity care needs and experiences of mothers with disabilities who are from minority populations, low-income families, and with low education level. We recommend additional research to more fully explore these intersections. As a final limitation, there was no comparison group of women without physical disabilities in the study. The inclusion of a comparison group of women without physical disabilities who had given birth would enable researchers to compare the prenatal care access and experiences between women with and without disabilities.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This article presents findings from the first nationally fielded survey of prenatal care experiences and unmet needs of women with physical disabilities in the United States, with a focus on women's perceptions of their prenatal care providers.

Specifically, injuries to the head or strangulation, may initiate neurological changes that contribute to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. These symptoms are often attributed to mental health diagnoses in this population. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the prevalence of and associations between reported probable traumatic brain injury (TBI) and CNS symptoms in a sample of women of African descent. Methods: A convenience sample of 901 women of African descent from Baltimore, MD and the US Virgin Islands, aged 18-55, was used to examine relationships among self-reported intimate partner violence (IPV), TBI, and CNS symptoms. Data were collected via Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview. Results: Abused women who experienced a probable TBI were more likely to report CNS symptoms than those who did not. When controlling for demographics, IPV, and mental health symptoms, probable TBI was associated with a two point increase in CNS symptom frequency score (95% confidence interval: 1.55-2.93, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Women who reported both probable TBI and IPV were more likely than their abused counterparts who reported no TBI to report CNS symptoms. This relationship held true even when controlling for symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinicians working with women should be aware of TBI as a possible etiology for symptoms in abused women. Appropriate screening and treatment protocols should be designed and implemented across medical settings to improve outcomes for women who have experienced IPV and TBI.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T raumatic brain injury (TBI) has been defined as ''an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force,'' that may result in cognitive impairment. 1 In the United States, there are *1.5 to 2 million persons that incur a TBI each year. 2,3 TBIs are most often the result of falls or being struck by a person or object. 4 TBI is most often categorized by severity of initial injury as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) into mild (GCS [13][14][15], moderate (GCS 9-12), and severe (GCS 3-8) sub-types. 5,6 Mild TBI (mTBI) is the most underreported type of TBI as many people do not seek medical attention, often selfdiagnosing with a concussion and making a false assumption that the condition will not be associated with further side effects. 7 Although, attention has been given to increase the awareness and identification of mTBI, many patients are discharged from emergency department or primary care visits without adequate information regarding the risk for lasting neurologic symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or cognitive slowing. This symptom cluster along with difficulty in concentrating and emotional lability among other symptoms comprises postconcussive syndrome. 8 When these symptoms do occur, referrals to appropriate resources such as neuropsychologists, neurologists, and occupational therapy may not be made.\nOne challenge with TBI literature is that it does not routinely differentiate the various mechanisms by which TBI can occur; specifically, physical abuse among victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) representing a subpopulation of individuals who often sustain multiple TBIs over time and reporting for many reasons may be reduced. Other populations, such as athletes and military personnel who sustain multiple mTBIs are shown to have a high risk for chronic neurological symptoms and deficits, whereas individuals with one or fewer TBIs tend to recover. 9,10 Multiple mTBIs have been shown to be particularly dangerous in situations where the brain has not recovered from the first insult, and over time, the effects of cumulative mTBI has been termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has been associated with depression, suicidality, and Alzheimer's-like syndromes. 10 This leads us to question how mTBIs in abused women may contribute to many of the neurological symptoms that we observe in these better studied, multiple mTBI subpopulations.\nIPV is a pattern of physical and/or sexual violence in the context of coercive control by an intimate or ex-intimate partner. 11,12 Women may be at high risk for assault related mTBIs, as one in three women experience IPV during their lifetimes, 11 and in women experiencing IPV, between 40% and 92% incur physical injuries to the head, and almost half report having experienced strangulation. 13,14 For many abused women, head injuries occur multiple times, in an escalating pattern, and cognitive or psychological effects are often viewed within the context of abuse rather than as a specific medical injury. 13,14 Damage to the structure and connectivity of neurons underlies functional impairments following an acute TBI. In chronic cases as has been shown in military and athlete subpopulations, it is likely that the secondary injury mechanisms, including the inflammatory response and disruption of neuronal electrophysiology result in cellular energy depletion and dysregulation of glucose metabolism that is related to long-term consequences. 10,15 The cascade of secondary injury influences neuronal recovery as manifested by cognitive impairment, as well as psychological and physical health. 10 While there has been evidence published, which shows associations between IPV and neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms consistent with postconcussive syndrome, limited work has examined this pathway through known or potential TBIs (inclusive of both blunt force injury to the head and strangulation events). 14,[16][17][18] As part of a casecontrol study examining the prevalence of IPV and its impact on health outcomes in women of African descent in Baltimore, MD and the US Virgin Islands (USVI), we aimed to examine the prevalence of probable TBIs and associations between probable TBIs and central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Specific questions included examining differences in prevalence of probable TBIs and CNS symptoms between abused women with and without reported probable TBI, as well as control group reporting no lifetime IPV.", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "A comparative case-control study was conducted in Baltimore, MD and St. Thomas and St. Croix in the USVI to examine health outcomes of IPV.

Based on prior prevalence estimates, the number of potentially eligible controls participants was hypothesized to exceed the number of cases, thus control selection was randomized by computer programming according to the 10 to 1 ratio identified in prior prevalence estimates. 21 The prevalence in the actual population was almost twice as high as predicted, resulting in a lower number of controls (n = 358) than cases (n = 543).", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "Variables for strangulation came from one question on the Danger Assessment (''Does he ever try to choke you?'') and one question from the Severity of Violence Against Women Scales (''In the past 12 months has your partner choked you?''). 22 Head injuries were measured using six questions from the Miller Abuse Physical Symptoms and Injury Scale (MAPSAIS). 23,24 Each included question from the MAPSAIS asks about past year injuries to the head or face (see Table 1 for a list of all six included injuries). These variables were dichotomized into ever or never for both injury to the head and strangulation. A combined dichotomous probable TBI variable, including participants who reported any injury to the head or strangulation event, was also created for analyses. While strangulation results in anoxic brain injury which is sometimes defined as distinct category of acquired brain injury separate from TBI, the potential neurological consequences of the two are similar. 25,26 Thus, for this analysis of the similarity in mechanism (blunt force injuries and strangulation, both being external sources of traumatic injury) and sequela, we include both mechanisms in our probably TBI variable.\nCNS symptoms were measured using the MAPSAIS and included nine specific symptoms (see Table 2 for a list of all nine symptoms included in the analysis). 23 For each symptom, women were asked: ''How often have you had this problem in the past year for any reason?'' they could respond on a Likert scale (0-4) with the choices: ''never/not at all; once; a few times; many times; or every day/almost every day.'' In addition to examining the proportion of women who experienced each particular symptom, we created an overall frequency score that totaled their responses to all nine symptoms, which resulted in a possible range of scores from 0 (never experienced any of the CNS symptoms in the past year) to 36 (experienced each of the CNS symptoms every day/almost every day in the past year).\nSymptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were measured using the 3-item Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD) 27 and the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), 28 respectively.

As shown in Table 1, in all categories of head and face injuries, abused women reported more injuries relative to nonabused women. These differences were significant in all categories except dental injuries. Strangulation was only measured in women reporting IPV, and 194 women reported at least one lifetime strangulation event by an intimate partner. Reported head injuries and strangulation events were similar between the two sites. Symptoms consistent with PTSD were more commonly reported by women in the USVI than in Baltimore (16% vs. 10%, p = 0.015).\nCNS symptoms were also more commonly reported among cases than controls (Table 2). Headaches were the only CNS symptom, in which a significant difference was not noted. Among cases only, each of the CNS symptoms was reported by more women who had experienced a probable TBI than those who had not. Seven out of nine symptoms reached significance, with headaches and seizures being the two that did not. CNS frequency scores in this sample ranged from 0 to 28 (median: 6; IQR: 2-10).

Prior literature on the topic presents a wide range of TBI prevalence among women who have experienced IPV (40%-92%). 13,33 Difficulty in determining a more specific prevalence estimate stems from challenges in measurement and sampling. Many studies of TBI in patients experiencing IPV rely on samples of victims who are seeking healthcare or advocacy services, which may not be representative of the larger population of abused women. 14,34 In addition, lack of care seeking following IPV-related head injuries is common, 16,17,35 limiting prospective clinical and research evaluation, thus leading to reliance on retrospective reporting in research. Similar to other studies that examined women in ED and shelter settings, having experienced a probable TBI was associated with increased reporting of CNS symptoms. 16,17,35 Our findings are unique in that they were obtained from an outpatient clinic-based sample (women not currently seeking violence specific or acute care services), and that we were able to compare rates of reported CNS symptoms with abused women who had not experienced an injury to the head or strangulation event.

This is important as TBIrelated CNS symptoms require interventions that greatly differ from those of mental health symptoms. For example, neuropsychological testing, occupational and physical therapy evaluations may be sought for symptoms associated with TBI. For this reason, additional assessment and interventions are likely needed in to identify and treat women who are experiencing TBI symptoms in the context of a current or past abusive relationship. Women who have experienced IPVrelated TBIs may enter the healthcare system through various avenues, including primary care, emergency departments (EDs) mental health settings, and drug and alcohol care. Incorporating brief but specific screening for TBI such as the HELPS Brain Injury Screening Tool 36 may help to identify women who could benefit from referrals to neurology and brain rehabilitation specialists. 37 Work in other high-risk populations has shown that TBI screening can be successfully implemented across various settings, including healthcare systems and community-based services providers. 37,38 Additional emerging risk stratification techniques such as neuroimaging may help to identify women at high risk for postconcussive syndrome and may aid clinicians in decision-making. 39 Partnerships with law enforcement and advocacy agencies providing services to abused women, as the first point of system contact for abused women, may further improve case-finding efforts and access to appropriate care. Concerted efforts to increase collaborating agencies' awareness about the link between IPV and mTBI may provide reciprocal long-term benefits to the justice and advocacy system in the form of better documentation of physiologic injury and improved symptomology with appropriate treatment.\nWhile screening for TBI is an important initial step in assuring women that they receive an appropriate care, much additional work is needed to determine the short-and longterm risks and benefits of implementing screening and referral protocols. As interventions for mTBI detection and treatment continue to improve, it is important that IPV providers and mTBI experts collaborate to establish protocols that are appropriate to the needs of this population. There are a few best practice protocols that have been developed by various organizations for acute care of IPV victims of strangulation 40 and a separate initiative for IPV head injury victims. 41 However, these existing protocols are lacking in features to actively capture both blunt force and strangulation injuries and CNS symptoms indicative of postconcussive syndrome. It is also important that screening efforts for TBI among IPV survivors occur in nonacute settings as prior work has shown that the minority of women seek medical care following an incident of head injury or strangulation. 16,17,35 While mental health disorders (PTSD and depression) were associated with increased CNS symptom reporting in this sample, the importance of mental health diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for these patients cannot be underestimated. Attention to both physical health and physiologic mechanisms associated with their symptomology may also help to validate women's experiences with violence.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "This study relied on cross-sectional, self-reported data and not on a clinical diagnosis, neuroimaging, or validated screening tool for TBI, possibly resulting in incorrect recall by participants. Variation in reporting time frame based on measure may compound this issues, as IPV and CNS symptom measures except the strangulation variable used for this analysis were time limited to past year or past 2 years, mental health symptoms were lifetime (PTSD) or current (past 2 weeks) reports. This has the potential to lead to variation in prevalence estimates and ability to detect associations. TBI, especially, may be underestimated with the past 1-year time frame, while lifetime screening of PTSD symptoms may not be reflective of current health status. As health outcomes more broadly were the topics of the study, TBI and CNS symptoms were secondary analyses. The measures used may therefore not completely or accurately capture all potential TBI causes or CNS symptoms experienced by participants. Future research should utilize clinical records or a more formal screening and diagnostic aids to identify patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for having experienced a TBI. Previous literature suggests that this population may face multiple head injuries as well as multiple nonfatal strangulation events over time. 33,42 A measure that more accurately collected information related to repeated head trauma from blunt force facial injuries (from punches, blows with weapon) and strangulation events, over time, would have been helpful in capturing any dose-response relationships between CNS symptoms and repeated TBI.\nSimilarly, CNS symptoms were self-reported, with no testing of neurological deficits undertaken either by physical exam or by neuropsychological testing, and the MAPSAIS has not been validated against clinical diagnosis. The implications of differences in reported symptoms using the MAP-SAIS score are therefore unknown. While the MAPSAIS CNS score did not meet the normality assumption for linear regression, it was deemed the most appropriate analysis as no cut-off score has been defined in the literature. Additional covariates such as acute anxiety or stress and other neurological diagnoses would also have been ideally added to strengthen the conclusions of association of outcomes with TBI.

The objective was to compare prevalence, severity, and impact of PGP and LBP among pregnant women in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. Women's desires for, access to, and experience of treatment were also examined. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire study of pregnant women, recruited at maternity care units in gestational weeks 30-38. Main outcome measures were presence and impact of PGP and/or LBP. Results: A total of 869 pregnant women from the United States (n = 214), the United Kingdom (n = 220), Norway (n = 220), and Sweden (n = 215) were included. PGP and/or LBP were reported by 70%-86%, with lowest prevalence in Scandinavia. Severity and impact differed significantly across countries ( p < 0.001), with U.K. women reporting the highest pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] 7/10) and highest mean total score on the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) (46/100). U.S. women were significantly less afflicted, with mean PGQ total score 35/100 ( p \u00a3 0.001). The countries differed regarding concern about PGP and/or LBP ( p < 0.001), with U.K. women being most affected (NRS 5/10). Norwegian women were most likely to receive treatment (53%) and U.S. women least likely (24%) ( p < 0.001). Among women receiving treatment, 68%-87% reported a positive effect. Conclusions: PGP and/or LBP during pregnancy are common in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. Severity, concern, and treatment experiences differed across countries. The majority of women who received treatment reported a positive effect.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P regnancy is often associated with positive expectations. For some, unexpected problems such as low-back pain (LBP) and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) occur. LBP is usually defined as pain between the 12th rib and the gluteal fold, and PGP as pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints and/or in the symphysis pubis. 1 The pain is related to the musculoskeletal system and is not caused by gynecological or urological disorders. Even though the etiology is unclear, PGP is a disorder with a unique clinical presentation and a need for specific management [2][3][4] and appears to have more impact on disability than LBP in pregnancy. 1,4 PGP limits most daily activities, work ability, and is associated with decreased healthrelated quality of life. 5,6 The prevalence of PGP and/or LBP during pregnancy is estimated to be 50% (3.9%-89.9%). 1,7 Twenty percent of pregnant women experience PGP that is sufficiently serious to require medical help. 7 Although the majority of women with PGP and LBP recover spontaneously soon after delivery, 8 persistent PGP was clinically identified in 33% of women 12 weeks after delivery. 9 In *5% of women, PGP may persist for years. 7,8,10 Pain located in the symphysis pubis and both sacroiliac joints may be considered as severe PGP 4,11 and increased pain severity during pregnancy has been correlated with decreased postpartum recovery rates. 8 PGP is reportedly ignored by healthcare professionals. 12,13 Women with PGP have described a lack of attention to, knowledge about, and understanding of the condition. 12,14,15 Women encounter conflicting diagnoses and advice given by different healthcare professionals and treatment is not commonly offered. 12,13,16 Even though pregnancy-related PGP seems to be an overlooked disorder in some parts of the world, it is reported in many countries. [17][18][19][20][21][22] Societal attitudes and a country's healthcare system probably influence how, and if, PGP and LBP are defined as specific disorders entitled to treatment and sickness benefit. Only one identified study has, to our knowledge, compared PGP and/or LBP across different countries. 17 However, prevalence was collected retrospectively and with differing methods, and neither consequences nor severity was investigated. Because many studies on PGP in pregnancy have originated in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, 4,6,[8][9][10]14,15,17,23,24 it is a common, but unsubstantiated, belief that PGP is more prevalent in Scandinavia.\nThis study compared prevalence, severity, and impact of PGP and/or LBP in pregnant women in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, using the same questionnaire, including the condition-specific Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) assessing activity and symptoms.

It included questions on the presence of PGP and/ or LBP in the current pregnancy and its impact on daily activities. 25 The presence and severity of pain were examined with the two questions: ''in the past 4 weeks, have you had pain in your low back and/or pelvis'' and ''if yes, was the pain bad enough to limit your usual activities or change your daily routine for more than one day?'' 25 A small diagram illustrating the low back and pelvis clarified the first question. The women were further asked about severity, frequency, and more specific location of pain. Activity limitations and symptoms were assessed by the reliable and valid conditionspecific PGQ 23,24 ; health-related quality of life by the Euro-Qol thermometer 26,27 ; pain frequency (some, most, every day); pain intensity (numeric rating scale [NRS] 0-10), 28 concerns about their PGP and LBP (NRS 0-10), and belief in recovery (in Norway the question was about persistence of pain after delivery) (yes, no, uncertain). Missing data in the PGQ were handled according to recommendations. 23 One section of the questionnaire was devoted to assessing whether the women had informed their prenatal care provider about their PGP and/or LBP (yes/no) and whether they believed they needed or had received treatment for their pain (yes/no). Follow-up questions determined which type of practitioner had provided the treatment, whether they were satisfied with the treatment (yes/no), and whether it had a positive effect (yes/no).\nDemographic data included questions on age, stage of pregnancy (in weeks), parity, height and weight, ethnicity, education completed (finished after compulsory/elementary school; college/high school; higher education/university), paid work status (full-time work/parental leave/unemployed), eligibility for paid sick leave (yes/no/not applicable), and current sickness benefit status (yes/no/not applicable). In addition, women were asked how they felt their household managed financially (very well-very badly).\nA pilot study in each of the four countries was undertaken.

PGP and/or LBP were reported by 70%-86%, with lowest prevalence in Norway and highest in the United States. A higher percentage of Norwegian women (50%) than U.S., U.K., and Swedish women (2%-20%) utilized sick leave. Compared with those in other countries, women from the United Kingdom completed significantly less higher education and significantly fewer were in full-time employment, although there was no significant difference in how the women rated how they managed financially.\nSeverity and impact differed significantly across countries ( p < 0.001) (Table 2). U.K. women reported the highest pain intensity (NRS 7/10) and highest score on the PGQ symptom scale (53/100). As shown by PGQ median percentiles in Figure 1, U.S. women were significantly less afflicted by PGP and/or LBP compared with those in other countries ( p = 0.001).\nThe scores on the PGQ were consistent with the finding that about one-third of the women in the United States reported limited daily activities because of PGP and/or LBP (Table 2). The quartiles of the PGQ total score showed that *25% of the women from all four countries scored >64/100. A subanalysis of women in the quartile with the highest disability according to the PGQ showed no difference between countries ( p = 0.26).

Norwegian and Swedish women reported their pain in the pelvis significantly more often ( p < 0.001) than U.K. and U.S. women, wherein pain in the lower back was the most commonly reported site ( p < 0.001).\nThe countries did differ regarding concerns about PGP and/or LBP ( p < 0.001), with U.K. women reporting the greatest concern (NRS 5/10). Three to five percent of women in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden believed that they would not recover, which corresponds with the 5% of Norwegian women who thought the pain would persist after delivery.\nAs shown in Table 3, Norwegian women were most likely to inform their prenatal provider about their PGP and/or LBP (89%) and U.S. women were least likely (59%) ( p < 0.001). Norwegian women were least likely referred for treatment (48% than U.K. women at 64% p = 0.03) although most likely to receive it (53%).

Chiropractors were the second most common providers in Norway, midwifes in Sweden and the United Kingdom, whereas in the United States, physicians were the second most common care providers. U.S. women reported the least satisfaction with treatment, which was statistically significantly different from Norway ( p < 0.001) and Sweden ( p = 0.011).\nEthnicity was investigated through country-specific questions.

Severity and impact, concerns about pain, belief in recovery, and treatment experiences differed across countries. In our study, the reported prevalence was between 70% and 86%, which corresponds with 70%-85% in a recent Cochrane review. 30 Prevalence was highest in the United States and lowest in the Scandinavian countries. To our knowledge, only one previous study has compared PGP and/or LBP across different countries, 17 where prevalence rates in Sweden, Finland, and Tanzania were compared. Swedish women reported lowest prevalence at 49% compared with 66%-81% elsewhere. However, that study used a retrospective design with no standardized outcome measurements, and, as with other studies, [19][20][21] lacked data about the consequences and severity of the women's complaints.\nThe impact of PGP on everyday life for pregnant women has been described in qualitative studies wherein women report trying to adapt and balance daily activities in light of their pain. 14,31 Pain with gait is reported as especially challenging. In studies with quantitative data, 73% of pregnant women in Norway reported having walking difficulties, and 81% of postpartum patients with PGP in the Netherlands reported having gait-associated pain. 23,32 In this study, U.S. women reported the highest prevalence of PGP and/or LBP, but the lowest disability level. This might be explained by lifestyle differences; pregnant women in the United States might walk less, [33][34][35][36] or it could be due to cultural differences in the way women adapt to or avoid pain-provoking activities. 12,37 Even though U.S. women scored significantly lower on the PGQ than women from other countries, one in three reported PGP and/or LBP affecting their daily life. U.S. women also showed significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than the Scandinavian women. Despite conflicting evidence, BMI has recently been associated with PGP. 38,39 U.S. women also demonstrated more years of formal education than women from the other three countries. It is unknown whether these factors or some other cultural difference accounts for the discrepancies in the PGQ data and their perception of the impact of PGP/LBP on their daily lives. U.K. women were most concerned about their PGP and/or LBP, showed the highest pain intensity, highest symptom score on the PGQ, most frequent pain at all three pelvic joints, and nearly one-third were uncertain that the pain would disappear after delivery. Increased pain reportedly triggers pain-related concerns 40 and previous studies have shown an association between education level and severity of symptoms. 37 This might explain the high impact reported by U.K. women as the U.K. sample demonstrated the lowest percentage of women completing higher education. This might also explain the discrepancy in U.S. women having the highest prevalence of PGP and/or/LBP but the lowest disability levels.\nConsistent with a previous study, only a small percentage of the women believed their pain would persist after childbirth, 31 although up to one-third were uncertain. This is in line with reports of pregnant women worrying about the nature of their PGP symptoms and expressing concern about these symptoms in future pregnancies. 12,14 Anxiety about etiology and prognosis of PGP has been reported as high, 41 and beliefs about prognosis influence recovery. 42 Adequate information on these topics from healthcare providers might be of great value in influencing these dynamics.\nAccording to the study's findings, Norwegian women were most likely to inform their prenatal provider about their pain (89%) and U.S. women least likely (59%). Still, women in Norway and Sweden have described how they were met with lack of knowledge and understanding from care providers. 14,15,43 Knowledge about prevalence and consequences of PGP and LBP during pregnancy are important for healthcare planning and to help ensure optimal treatment.\nNorwegian women in this study were most likely to receive treatment (53%) and U.S. women least likely (24%). If pregnancy-related PGP or LBP is not identified or accepted as a problem, there is a risk that the need for treatment will be ignored. In previous research, women reported being met with unknowledgeable staff, lack of intervention, 13,16 felt ignored, and wished health professionals to be proactive in asking about PGP and/or LBP. 12,44 It is likely that Norwegian women self-referred to healthcare practitioners as treatment possibilities for pregnancy-related PGP are well known. Recently, information provided online by other women in the same situation was valued higher than advice from health professionals. 45 The literature has cautioned against acceptance of such peer advice. 43 Taken together, the findings of our study and others' indicate a need for more knowledge about the common pain types among women who are experiencing these symptoms. Severe pain with a negative effect on daily life should not be ignored or seen as normal. To address women's need for more precise and consistent advice, 12 it is probably important that healthcare providers seek to differentiate between PGP and LBP. As PGP seems to have more impact on disability than LBP, 29 optimal treatment and self-management strategies probably differ. 4,29 Furthermore, practitioners need to know more about competent examination, management, and satisfaction with care among the women. [12][13][14][15][16]43 There is a risk that PGP and/or LBP will become long lasting if left untreated or managed with nonspecific treatment, 46 and full recovery has been found to be low for women with persistent PGP and/or LBP. 47 In this study, aside from prenatal care providers, physical therapists were the professionals in all four countries most likely to have provided treatment, and among women receiving treatment, 68%-87% reported a positive effect. Approximately half of those women asking for help in this study were referred for treatment, and up to one-third reported an unmet need for treatment. Since there are reported evidence-based treatment strategies effective in the management of this condition, 30,48 and as the majority of women receiving treatment reported a positive effect, healthcare providers should consider treatment for PGP and/ or LBP.\nOne limitation of this study is its successive sampling. A nonconsecutive sampling may have led to increased recruitment of women with pain, possibly overestimating prevalence. No disease or dysfunction limitations were used for exclusion from the study nor was any health history collected. It is possible that some of the participants could have had PGP and/or LBP in association with other disease states, but this would not impact the overall prevalence data. These complications could impact the care the women received or did not receive, and we acknowledge this as a limitation in the interpretation of the study statistics.\nAnother limitation is that even though we collected data at different locations in each country, we cannot generalize our findings to be representative of women in the countries as a whole. In the United States, for example, we attempted to gain multiethnic representation by utilizing two large urban settings in addition to one smaller city; however, participant diversity was not achieved. A strength, however, is that this is the first study to examine PGP and/or LBP in pregnancy across different countries using consistent methodology and employing a reliable and valid condition-specific outcome measure because no valid instrument for cross-cultural comparisons has been used in previous studies; accurate comparison of severity and consequences across countries has been difficult. 13,22 In this study, PGP and/or LBP were self-reported. The presence of pain was, however, confirmed by additional questions and a pain diagram. 25 It is, however, a study limitation that respondents were not clinically examined, thus it cannot be clinically confirmed that respondents did, indeed, suffer from PGP, LBP, or both. Norwegian and Swedish women most frequently located their pain in the pelvis than in the lower back as reported by the U.S. and U.K. respondents. This may be due to increased attention paid to PGP in Norway and Sweden where much of the previous research on this condition has occurred. 3,11,29,[49][50][51][52][53] However, in pregnant Iranian women who were clinically examined, PGP was almost two times more prevalent than LBP. 20 In the United States and the United Kingdom, PGP may be hidden behind the general LBP label. Women who have sought help for their PGP and/or LBP have expressed doubts about how to selfdiagnose and report conflicting diagnoses from different healthcare professionals they see. 12,43 Therefore, the validity of respondent self-diagnosis and selection of their pain location might be questionable.\nFor future research, knowledge of cultural or lifestyle differences in the way women adapt to or avoid painprovoking activities could inform healthcare planning for improved management of PGP and LBP.", "n_publication_ref": 61, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Severity and worries about PGP and/or LBP during pregnancy and treatment experiences differed across countries.

[1][2][3] Considered to be a component of genitourinary symptom of menopause (GSM), 4 VVA is commonly accompanied by physiological changes to the vulva and vagina (i.e., dryness or pallor of vaginal mucosa, thinning of vaginal rugae, or petechiae) and is associated with symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. 3 Vaginal dryness was recently found to be the most common menopausal symptom in North American and European women with vaginal symptoms. 5 VVA symptoms are persistent, progressive, and may have an adverse effect on quality of life. 3,6 Surveys of women with VVA and their partners also show that vaginal discomfort negatively impacts intimate relationships. 7,8 Even though VVA is persistent and worsens in severity if left untreated, less than one-third of postmenopausal women seek treatment for their symptoms. 9 Over-the-counter vaginal lubricants and moisturizers are often the first-line treatments for postmenopausal VVA, but they do not address the underlying atrophy due to changes in proportions of vaginal cells (decrease in superficial cells and increase in parabasal cells), and have been perceived as messy and inconvenient by many women. 6,10 Hormone therapy (HT), either vaginal or systemic, is available to women suffering from moderate-tosevere VVA or GSM. 6 However, HT use has been limited by women's safety concerns associated with systemic exposure to estrogens and concerns raised by the black boxed warning required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies. 9,11,12 Ospemifene is an orally administered, estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist (also known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator [SERM]) approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia due to postmenopausal VVA 13 and in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe symptomatic VVA in postmenopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal estrogen therapy. 14 Clinical studies have shown that ospemifene, at the approved dose of 60 mg, significantly reduces the severity of dyspareunia and has a beneficial effect on vaginal dryness. [15][16][17][18][19][20][21] Hot flushes are a commonly reported adverse event (AE) with ospemifene 60 mg 15,18,19 ; however, a recently published pooled analysis of hot flush treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) found that the frequency of hot flushes declined after 4 weeks of ospemifene treatment. 22 In addition, while ospemifene has been shown to have estrogenlike effects on the vaginal epithelium, it has a neutral effect on the endometrium, with no reported cases of endometrial cancer or atypical endometrial hyperplasia over a treatment period of 52 weeks. 16 However, the label for ospemifene has a black box warning about estrogen agonism in the endometrium. 13 A previously reported post hoc analysis of safety data also revealed that ospemifene does not have detrimental effects on the lipid and coagulation parameters in postmenopausal women. 23 Finally, preclinical and clinical data demonstrated that ospemifene 60 mg has a beneficial estrogenic effect on bone [24][25][26][27][28] and antiestrogenic effect on breast tissue. 21,25,26,[28][29][30][31][32] In this study, we report results from an integrated safety analysis of pooled data from six phase 2 and 3 clinical trials evaluating the effect of ospemifene 60 mg on the breast, cardiovascular system, and bone in postmenopausal women.", "n_publication_ref": 47, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "Clinical safety data were pooled from six phase 2 and 3, double-blind placebo-controlled studies (studies 15-50717, 15-50615, 22 1506002, 30 15-50821, 17,18 15-50310 15 /15-50310x, 20 15-50718 21 ; Table 1).

The results from this analysis further extend data from individual clinical studies demonstrating the safety of ospemifene 60 mg in healthy postmenopausal women (study 1506002 30 ), those diagnosed with VVA (studies 15-50717, 15-50310 9 /15-50310x, 20 15-50718, 21 15-50821 17,18 ), and those experiencing moderate-to-severe hot flushes (study 15-50615 22 ).\nRelatively few women discontinued ospemifene 60 mg due to AEs; however, those that did reported hot flushes as the most common reason for discontinuation. A separate analysis of the pooled hot flush TEAE data found that the incidence of hot flush TEAEs was significantly greater with ospemifene 60 mg (8.5%) versus placebo (3.2%; p < 0.0001). 22 However, hot flush TEAEs were most frequently experienced within the first 4 weeks of initiating ospemifene and declined with continuous use. 22 HT use within 6 months of study start ( p = 0.0294), longer study treatment duration ( p = 0.0258), and higher frequency of hot flush days per month at baseline ( p = 0.0326) were also identified as significant predictors of hot flush events with ospemifene 60 mg. 22 Finally, ospemifene 60 mg was not found to worsen the frequency or severity of hot flushes in a 6week, placebo-controlled study  of 198 postmenopausal women experiencing at least 7 moderate-to-very severe hot flushes per day (or 50 per week). 22 While the clinical data for breast safety (in particular breast cancer) is currently limited, this integrated safety analysis demonstrated that the breast tolerability profile (breast-related TEAEs, abnormal mammograms, and breast palpation) following ospemifene treatment for up to 52 weeks was similar to that of placebo. The clinical breast safety data for ospemifene were consistent with previously reported cell-and animalbased studies. 28,29,32 A recent in vitro study found ospemifene inhibited proliferation and opposed estradiol stimulation in normal human breast tissue samples obtained from 26 postmenopausal women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. 32 Collectively, the data suggest that ospemifene 60 mg likely has neutral to antagonistic effect in the breast; however, these preclinical data need to be confirmed by longer term clinical breast safety data, including breast density data.\nOspemifene 60 mg, as shown in this analysis, does not have a detrimental effect on cardiovascular problems in healthy postmenopausal women. In addition, there were no reports of heart attacks, heart failure, or death from coronary heart disease. The cardiovascular safety of ospemifene is supported by findings from a separate post hoc analysis, which demonstrated that ospemifene did not have a negative effect on the lipid and coagulation parameters in postmenopausal women. 23 Compared with placebo, ospemifene 60 mg significantly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in postmenopausal women at 3, 6, and 12 months with no adverse effects on total cholesterol and triglycerides. 23 Ospemifene 60 mg, compared with placebo, also significantly reduced fibrinogen levels, but the levels remained within the normal clinically acceptable range for majority of the patients. 23 Reported incidences of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (a disease which includes both DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE]) events did not differ significantly between the ospemifene and placebo groups. In general, the venous thrombosis safety of ospemifene was consistent with reports for other SERMs. Incidence of VTE per 1000 patient-years was 2.12 for ospemifene 60 mg, 1.7 for bazedoxifene 20 mg, 33 and 3.5 raloxifene 60 mg. 34 In this post hoc analysis, the likelihood of experiencing a DVT was not significant in healthy low-risk women treated with ospemifene 60 mg (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.11-3.14) compared with placebo, which is in contrast to what has been previously reported for raloxifene 60 mg (RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.9) 34 and bazedoxifene 20 mg (HR 8.0, 95% CI 1.01-64.25) in older postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 33 Note, however, that this analysis was not powered to determine the risk of DVT with ospemifene or its use in higher risk populations.\nEstrogen loss upon the onset of menopause often leads to loss of bone density and osteoporosis. Preclinical 28,35 and individual clinical studies (using biochemical markers to evaluate bone health) 26,27 have shown that ospemifene does not have a negative impact on the bone health of postmenopausal women. 24 Our safety data are consistent with these previous reports as the incidence of vertebral and otherrelated fractures was low with ospemifene 60 mg (1.2%) and comparable to placebo (1.5%) in women in whom osteoporotic risk was not evaluated. Based on early clinical data, ospemifene may protect against bone loss due to menopause with continuous use; however, this needs to be confirmed by longer term clinical data on bone density and fractures in women at risk for osteoporosis.\nEndometrial and uterine safety are of key importance when prescribing estrogen-based treatments, including ospemifene, to postmenopausal women. Results from a post hoc analysis of pooled phase 2 and 3 endometrial and uterine safety data for ospemifene 60 mg have been previously reported. 16 The analysis demonstrated that proportions of women with endometrial thickness ( \u20215 mm) and vaginal bleeding did not vary significantly with ospemifene 60 mg (n = 851) versus placebo (n = 543) in women with an intact uterus. 16 Incidence of suspected endometrial polyps based on histology was similar with ospemifene 60 mg (1.4%) and placebo (1.6%). 16 Incidence of uterine polyps was 0.6% with ospemifene 60 mg and 0.2% for placebo. 16 One ospemifenetreated patient (0.3%) experienced simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, which is well within the FDA recommended rate of <1% with an upper bound <4% of the one-side 95% CI. 16 No cases of endometrial cancer, endometrial carcinomas, complex hyperplasia, or hyperplasia with atypia were observed with either ospemifene 60 mg or placebo. 16 Despite the safety data presented above, the prescribing information for ospemifene includes a boxed warning issued by the FDA, which states that ''there is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens.'' 13 The warning also recommends prescribing progestin when recommending an estrogen-based treatment to postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. However, this is not clinically recommended as there are no safety and efficacy data for ospemifene and progestogen combination therapy. The boxed warnings appear to be based on endometrial safety data for systemic HT and to raise caution. 36,37 Women who develop postmenopausal vaginal bleeding while taking ospemifene should be evaluated with appropriate testing such as vaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy.\nThe strengths of this pooled analysis are the large number of subjects, the 40-week extension study, and the ability to detect the occurrence of infrequent AEs. The post hoc nature of this analysis, which combines multiple studies varying in length and endpoints, as well as the predominantly healthy, nonobese white patient population, limits the generalizability of the findings to the general population. Furthermore, this analysis of safety data combined from multiple studies was not designed or powered to rigorously determine the risk of breast, cardiovascular, and bone-related AEs. Longer term clinical trials and monitoring are needed to establish the risk of complications that typically evolve more slowly, such as endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and bone fractures, risks in different ethnic populations, or in women at risk for serious outcomes.", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This post hoc analysis of pooled safety data for predominantly healthy, nonobese, white postmenopausal women suggests that ospemifene 60 mg once daily does not detrimentally impact the breast, bone, and cardiovascular health of these women with results comparable to placebo.

Therefore, endometriosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed with significant delay. 4 Such painful symptoms may significantly impair physical, mental, and social well-being; and infertility itself may cause psychological stress, low self-esteem, and depression. 5 These factors, alone or combined, supposedly reduce quality of life (QoL) of these patients.\nAccording to World Health Organization, QoL is defined as a multi-dimensional construct of the individual perception of one's position in life in the context of culture and value systems in relation to goals, expectations, standards, and concerns. 6 It is affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, beliefs, and their relationship to salient features of their environment. 5 Endometriosis has been reported to deteriorate multiple domains in women's lives, including daily activities, social relationships, family planning and work productivity, among others. [7][8][9][10] Despite such influence of endometriosis in women's lives, specific cause and effect relationships between symptoms and areas of impairment remain unclear, and inconsistent evidence exists as to if the diagnosis per se poses an additional burden to QoL. 4,5 With this in mind, this article aims to compile concise and descriptive results of several studies to assess the burden of endometriosis on QoL.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This integrative review was carried out by consulting the BIREME/MEDLINE databases through July 2017.

Nine studies 9,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] used the Short Form 36 (SF-36), 20 a questionnaire that assesses general health-related QoL. In six of these studies, 9,13,[15][16][17]19 it was used as the only QoL questionnaire. In the remaining three, it was employed along with other QoL instruments: in Marki et al., 12 with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); in Friedl et al., 14 with the 30-item Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30); and in Petrelluzzi et al., 18 with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ).\nThree articles [21][22][23] used the Short Form 12 (SF-12), 24 of which only one 23 used it along with another QoL tool. Two reports 2,25 employed the Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2), 26 both along with the World Endometriosis Research Foundation's Global Study of Women's Health instrument (WERF-GSWH). 2 Four studies 10,[27][28][29] used the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-bref (WHOQOL-bref). 6 Two studies 14,30 used the EHP-30, 31 which assesses endometriosis-related QoL, and one 23 used its shorter variant, the 5-item Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-5). 32 The Duke Health Profile 33 was employed in two studies, 30,34 while the EuroQOL-5-dimension instrument (EQ-5D) 35 was used once. 36 Additionally, three articles [37][38][39] collected qualitative data from discussion groups. Another two 40,41 did not use validated QoL questionnaires, but reported results in a quantitative approach. Data are summarized in Table 1.\nThe SF-36, a questionnaire for general QoL, consists of 36 items in eight domains: physical functioning; role-physical; bodily pain; general health; vitality; social functioning; roleemotional; and mental health. 20 It has been validated in women with endometriosis and is an useful tool for the assessment of QoL of such patients during diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. 42 Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QoL. The SF-36v2 is similar to its first version, but had changes made to wording of questions and response categories. 26 The SF-12 is a subset of the SF-36 that measures the same eight domains with reduced length. It is a practical alternative for the SF-36, especially in the overall physical and mental health outcomes, and yields two different global scores: Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). 24 The QoL assessment instrument WHOQOL-bref is a brief questionnaire comprising 26 items, including two items for overall QoL and general health, and another 24 items categorized in four broad domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental health). Scores for each item range from one to five, with the highest score indicating the best QoL for the corresponding item. 6 Another generic self-report QoL instrument is the Duke Health Profile. This questionnaire contains six health measures (physical, mental, social, perceived health, and selfesteem) as well as four dysfunction measures (anxiety, depression, pain, and disability). It is a useful tool in monitoring health, although less commonly used than other generic tools. 33 The EQ-5D is generic instrument that includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain, and emotional well-being (depression or anxiety). Each item is scored based on a three-point scale, and the EQ-5D score is calculated by their sum, resulting in scores ranging from 0 (best possible status) to 10 (worst possible status). 43 QoL in patients with endometriosis may also be assessed using disease-specific questionnaires, such as the EHP-30. 31 This is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of a core instrument made up of 30 items covering pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image; and a modular part with a total of 23 items distributed in six areas: work, relationship with children, sexual relationship, feelings about medical profession, feelings about treatment, and feelings about infertility. Each scale is standardized on a score ranging from 0 to 100, where the lowest score represents the best health status. The EHP-5, on the other hand, is a shorter version consisting of five items in the core and six items in the modular questionnaire, which has been proven as reliable in settings where a less timeconsuming instrument is required. 32 The WERF-GSWH, another disease-specific questionnaire, was designed and validated for the WERF Global ", "n_publication_ref": 57, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ENDOMETRIOSIS AND QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION 401", "text": "Study on Women's Health to determine the impact of disease on work, education, and social well-being, including symptoms that have occurred at any point since the onset of disease.

In the model constructed, these three variables explained 55% of the variance in overall QoL, 41% of the variance in physical QoL and 55% in mental QoL. Pain symptoms were more correlated to the physical component of QoL than to its mental component. In the latter, the effect of pain occurred indirectly, via psychological stress, which in turn showed itself to be a major predictive factor of QoL. This research group did not report SF-36 scores; rather, they presented only correlation scores and QoL models.\nL\u00f6vkvist et al. 13 evaluated the impact of endometriosis on QoL using the SF-36 in 431 patients of different age groups, and compared their results to data from the general female population. Women with endometriosis had significantly lower SF-36 scores than the general population, especially in the domains vitality, role-physical and general health. Younger women (under 30 years old) with endometriosis reported more disease-related problems than patients above 40 years, showing significantly lower scores in the domains role-physical, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. QoL was negatively affected by number of symptoms and positively affected by age. Specific scores reported for each SF-36 domain in patients and controls are shown in Table 2.\nUsing the SF-36 and the EHP-30, Friedl et al. 14 investigated QoL in 62 patients with endometriosis from a univer-sity clinic. The SF-36 was also applied to 61 healthy controls, who reported better subjective general health, vitality, roleemotional and mental health scores than controls ( p < 0.001). After controlling for age and relationship status, women with endometriosis still had lower general health and vitality scores than controls. In the role-emotional and mental health domain, age had a significant influence, with increasing age being related to better functioning. The EHP-30 scores of patients in this study were compared to published samples from two other hospitals, with the study patients showing better scores in the control and powerlessness ( p = 0.002) in one hospital and in all domains ( p < 0.001) in the other.\nMelis et al. 15 assessed QoL using the SF-36 in 41 women with deep endometriosis and 40 healthy women of childbearing age. In addition to having significantly more pain, women with endometriosis had significantly poorer scores in the physical functioning, role-physical, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health, general health perceptions, and vitality domains ( p < 0.001).\nNunes et al. 9 applied the SF-36 and compared QoL of 257 endometriosis patients with 253 healthy controls. Patients had significantly lower scores in all SF-36 domains (Table 2), indicating poorer QoL. Women in the endometriosis group were further subdivided into subgroups according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) endometriosis staging. When subgroup Ia (grades I-II) and Ib (grades III-IV) were compared, no statistical differences were observed.\nCentini et al. 16 compared 84 women with ASRM stage I-II endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and 78 women with CPP without endometriosis, all of childbearing age. In both groups, pain had a negative influence on QoL, but the endometriosis group had significantly lower QoL scores than symptomatic controls in the physical role, emotional role, and bodily pain domains of the SF-36. Dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pain were negatively correlated with role- physical, role-emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental health scores in the endometriosis group ( p < 0.05). Dysmenorrhea did not correlate with any domains in the nonendometriosis group, but nonmenstrual pain was negatively correlated with physical role and general health ( p < 0.05).\nSimilarly, Minson et al. 17 evaluated 130 women with endometriosis using the SF-36. Lowest mean score was reported in the vitality domain, and the highest in the physical functioning. Considering all domains, mean SF-36 score was 62.6. Dysmenorrhea was weakly, but significantly correlated with the physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and social role domains. There were no significant correlations between disease staging and age nor between disease staging and SF-36 scores.\nPetrelluzzi et al. 18 compared 93 patients with endometriosis to 82 healthy women. The SF-36 scores of controls were higher than 60 in all of the questionnaire domains, while endometriosis patients scored higher than 60 only for the physical functioning domain. Endometriosis subjects had significantly worse QoL in both the physical and mental components of the questionnaire ( p < 0.001); and their QoL was poorer in all domains except role-emotional. Scores in the general health perception and physical functioning domains were negatively correlated with pain intensity (Spearman's test -0.51 and -0.46, respectively, p < 0.05).\nLaursen et al. 19 compared 40 patients and 41 healthy controls. Of the 40 patients, 10 had endometriosis, 10 had fibromyalgia and/or whiplash (grouped together due to symptom similarity), 10 had chronic low back pain, and 10 had rheumatoid arthritis. There were no differences in pain duration between groups. Patients with endometriosis had significantly higher scores in the role-physical, roleemotional, social functioning, mental health, and vitality domains than the fibromyalgia/whiplash group. Mean SF-36 role-emotional score was negatively correlated with pain intensity in endometriosis ( p = 0.01). Comparisons between the endometriosis and control groups were not reported.\nUsing the SF-36v2 and the WERF-GSWH, De Graaff et al. 25 reported QoL in 930 women with endometriosis. A significant proportion cited that the disease had a negative effect on work (51%), relationships (50%) and education (16%) at some point since diagnosis. Women aged 25-44 years had significantly worse QoL scores for all domains compared to the norm-based U.S. population. Multivariate regression analysis with the physical and mental components showed that QoL was negatively affected by presence of chronic pain and number of comorbidities, but dysmenorrhea showed no independent effect in either component.\nWith the same two questionnaires in a multicentric setting involving 10 countries, Nnoaham et al. 2 assessed QoL in 745 women with endometriosis, 587 patients with suggestive symptoms but no endometriosis (symptomatic controls), and 86 healthy controls. Participants with endometriosis had poorer scores than symptomatic controls in the physical functioning, role-physical, role-mental, and bodily pain SF-36v2 dimensions; and worse scores than healthy controls in the bodily pain domain. Compared with symptomatic controls, endometriosis women had significantly reduced physical health component (PCS). All groups in this study had lower MCS scores than the normative population.\nDeGraaff et al. 21 used the SF-12 to evaluate QoL in 83 women with endometriosis and 50 healthy controls. Women with endometriosis reported higher pain levels for all pain symptoms, including dysmenorrhea and CPP. When compared to controls, they had significantly poorer scores in the physical health (median 68.8 vs. 90.6) and mental health (median 65.8 vs. 83.1) components of the SF-12. Regression analyses performed to identify predictors for QoL showed that CPP and depression were significant and independent predictors, but that having endometriosis per se was not.\nAlso using the SF-12, Facchin et al. 22 investigated QoL in 110 women with endometriosis, of which 78 had pelvic pain  23 adopted the SF-12 along with the EHP-5 in 193 women with endometriosis. The majority of subjects (70%) rated their general health status as at least ''good,'' but almost all reported effects of endometriosis-related symptoms on their general well-being in the previous month. Mean PCS and MCS scores were 38.4 and 39.5, respectively, indicating considerable disability. Regarding the EHP-5, 43% of participants reported that pain interfered with work considerably, 41% stated that they were physically impaired in the previous month, 68% had mood changes, 41% perceived that pain controlled their life, 61% felt that no one understood their feelings, and 48% had poor concept of their physical appearance. Mean EHP-5 score was not reported.\nAdditionally, Kiykac Altinbas et al. 27 used the WHOQOLbref to assess QoL in 33 Turkish women with stage IV endometriosis according to the revised criteria of the American Fertility Society classification. Dysmenorrhea and CPP were present in 90.9% of patients. In the WHOQOL-bref, mean physical score was 71.3, while mean psychological, social, and environmental scores were 72.4, 71.7, and 69.0, respectively. Only dysmenorrhea was negatively correlated with physical, social, and environmental domains. No statistically significant correlation was seen between QoL domains and pain intensity.\nWith the WHOQOL-bref, Souza et al. 28 examined QoL in 57 women with CPP, of which 32 had endometriosis and 25 did not. All endometriosis were classified as minimal and mild. Groups were similar in epidemiological characteristics and pain intensity, as well as in physical, psychological, social, and environmental parameters of QoL. In the overall sample of 57 women, patients with greater pain scores (defined as pain above the 75th percentile) had significantly reduced QoL scores in the psychological and environmental domain when compared to patients with lower pain scores (i.e., below the 25th percentile).\nTripoli et al. 29 also used the WHOQOL-bref to evaluate QoL in 49 women with CPP and endometriosis (Group 1), 35 women with CPP due to other causes (Group 2) and 50 healthy controls (Group 3). Groups 1 and 2 had poorer scores than controls in the physical ( p < 0.001) and psychological ( p = 0.032) sections of the WHOQOL-bref, as well as in overall QoL ( p = 0.001), but not in the social and environmental sections. No significant differences were present between Group 1 and Group 2, nor between patients with different stages of endometriosis.\nSepulcri et al. 10 applied the WHOQOL-bref to 104 women with endometriosis. Seventy percent of their sample was sedentary and 80.8% had pelvic pain. Median QoL scores indicated that women classified their psychological and social QoL as medium (median 50), physical domain as below average (48.2) and environmental score as above average (54.7). Duration of treatment and pain intensity were negatively correlated with QoL in the physical domain ( p < 0.05). No differences were seen between women with different endometriosis stages regarding QoL nor pain intensity.\nMoreover, using the Duke Health Profile along with the EHP-30, Stratton et al. 30 analyzed QoL in 18 women with CPP and endometriosis (Group 1), 11 women with CPP without confirmed endometriosis (Group 2) and 20 healthy controls. In the Duke Health Profile, Group 1 showed significantly better scores than Group 2 in the social health, general health, self-esteem, and perceived health domains; Group 1 also had worse scores than controls in all domains except social health and self-esteem. In the EHP-30, women in Group 1 had significantly more impairment than controls in every domain, but EHP-30 scores among women in Groups 1 and 2 were similar. Patients with endometriosis reported tiring more easily as well as more achiness, inability to sleep properly, and need to rest than the other groups, with statistical significance.\nAlso using the Duke Health Profile, Karp et al. 34 examined 108 women with CPP, of which 81 had endometriosis and 27 did not. Subjects had low QoL scores for pain, disability, depression and general health, regardless of the presence of endometriosis. Women with CPP due to other causes had significantly worse general health than those with endometriosis, but groups showed similar results in the pain, depression and disability scores.\nFinally, with the EQ-5D, Touboul et al. 36 assessed QoL in 159 patients with deeply infiltrating endometriosis. Dysmenorrhea was the most frequently reported symptom. On a 0-10 scale, mean EQ-5D score was 7.7, and scores were associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, cyclic pelvic pain, and defecation symptoms. Intensity of dysmenorrhea was positively correlated with EQ-5D and with health state domain scores. No correlation between QoL score and age was seen.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Stress questionnaires and scores", "text": "Two studies 12,18 measured perceived stress, each using a different tool: the PSQ 44 and PSS. 45 The PSQ specifically measures stress in clinical psychosomatic research, and consists of 30 questions that correlate with symptomatic complaints and health outcomes. In turn, the PSS is a self-reported survey with 14 items, used to measure the characteristics of feelings and thoughts related to one's perception of stress. 45 Marki et al., 12 using the PSS in 193 women with endometriosis, reported that psychological stress showed itself to be a major predictive factor of QoL, mediating the effect caused by physical pain and by emotion regulation difficulties. This study did not report specific PSS scores, and did not have a control group.\nIn turn, Petrelluzzi et al. 18 compared 93 women with endometriosis to 82 healthy women using the PSQ. They reported that perceived stress was significantly higher (thus indicating more stress) in women with endometriosis and CPP than in controls. There was a negative correlation (Spearman's test -0.52) between PSQ scores and scores in the mental health domain, suggesting that increased stress is associated with worse mental health-related QoL. Within the endometriosis group, women with constant pain had higher PSQ scores than those with intermittent pain ( p \u00a3 0.05).

Women in the endometriosis group were further subdivided into subgroups according to ASRM endometriosis staging. When subgroup Ia (grades I-II) and Ib (grades III-IV) were compared, no statistical differences were seen. In subgroup Ia, physical activity levels were considered low in 60.7%, moderate in 36%, and high in 3.4% of patients; while in subgroup Ib, they were low in 65.5%, moderate in 26.8%, and high in 7.7% of women.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sleep quality questionnaire and scores", "text": "Sleep quality was assessed in only one article, 46 which used the validated Post-Sleep Inventory (PSI). 48 The PSI is a 30-item questionnaire that measures several aspects of sleep. Higher scores indicate better sleep quality, while lower scores represent poorer sleep quality.\nAdopting the PSI, Nunes et al. 46 reported that sleep quality was significantly worse in women with endometriosis (mean 5.68 -1.55) than in asymptomatic controls (6.04 -1.62, p = 0.011). Women in the endometriosis group were further subdivided into ASRM subgroups, but subgroups Ia (grades I-II) and Ib (grades III-IV) showed similar mean PSI scores ( p = 0.850). In all groups, there was a negative correlation between pain scores and the PSI score: the higher pain scores, the lower sleep quality ( p \u00a3 0.05). Poorer sleep quality was also associated with lower paint threshold in specific body sites.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Qualitative results", "text": "Roomaney and Kagee 37 examined health-related QoL in 25 South African women with endometriosis through semistructured interviews, in both the private and public health systems. Ten categories emerged, namely medical factors, physical functioning, psychological functioning, sexual functioning, reproductive functioning, occupational functioning, information/knowledge, healthcare/medical treatment, and financial considerations. CPP was reported by all women, with varying duration and intensity, and limited their ability to function physically and to perform simple movements such as changing position. Patients experienced menstrual irregularities, and some mentioned that menorrhagia, and pain, resulted in sleep disruption. Women cited various emotions, including distress, sadness, frustration, low selfesteem, and hopelessness due to the disease. Endometriosis was described as a central feature in the lives of participants, and its impact was managed with a combination of problemfocused and emotion-focused coping strategies.\nMoradi et al. 38 conducted a qualitative design study using semi-structured focus group discussions with 35 Australian women with endometriosis, from both a dedicated Endometriosis Centre and the community. Women were separated into three distinct age groups: Group 1 (16-24 years), Group 2 (25-34 years), and Group 3 (35 years and above). Two main themes emerged: experiences of living with endometriosis and the impact of endometriosis on women's lives. Social life, physical and psychological impact were among the most highlighted impacts in all three groups, but with different priorities. Education was the second most highlighted for Group 1, life opportunities and employment for Group 2, and financial impact for those in Group 3. Most participants reported that endometriosis had significant impact since they experienced symptoms every day. They also reported that pain in particular limited their normal daily physical activity, along with other symptoms, treatment side effects, and changes in physical appearance. Additionally, most women described feelings of anger, powerlessness, hopelessness, frustration, and exhaustion as a consequence of the disease, and concern over the future. Most participants also had a reduction in social activity. Overall, Group 1 reported the highest number of concerns compared to the other two. Patients reported that their lack of previous knowledge about the disease contributed to increasing anxiety and worry.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Other studies", "text": "Two articles 40,41 did not use validated QoL questionnaires, but reported results in a quantitative manner. Fourquet et al. 40 used patient-reported outcome data to determine the burden of endometriosis in 107 women with surgically diagnosed disease. Their questionnaire included demographic information and gynecologic profile; symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments; impact on daily life activities and work performance. All patients had symptoms; most characterized their pain as nonmenstrual and reported that it interfered with daily life activities. Subjects commonly reported that endometriosisrelated symptoms disrupted all aspects of their daily lives. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that symptoms significantly predict negative impact on women's daily life activities and social life.\nLastly, Oehmke et al. 41 developed a questionnaire consisting of 51 questions exploring patients' clinical histories, symptoms, and impact of endometriosis on QoL. Sixty-five women with endometriosis were included. Dysmenorrhea was present in 33.8%; of these, 45.5% had impaired ability to perform everyday chores, sports, and leisure activities and 50% had experienced social isolation.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The most commonly used QoL tool was the SF-36, followed by the WHOQOL-bref and SF-12. Interestingly, diseasespecific questionnaires (EHP-30, EHP-5, or WERF-GSWH) were only used in five articles, perhaps because the use of such tools limits comparability between patients and controls. Other instruments were applied in one to two studies each (Table 1). Most studies were limited by small sample sizes and/or suboptimal study design and subject selection protocols.\nWomen with endometriosis had worse QoL than healthy women in several domains of their lives. When either version of the SF-36 was applied, significant differences between women with endometriosis and controls were observed in the physical functioning domain in three articles 9,13,18 ; rolephysical domain in four articles 2,9,13,18 ; bodily pain domain in three, 2,9,18 social functioning in two, 9,18 role-emotional in three, 2,9,14 mental health in three, 9,14,18 general health perceptions in four, and vitality in four 9,13,14,18 articles as well. Scores in each domain are compiled in Table 2, except for Marki et al., 12 Melis et al., 15 and Minson et al., 17 who did not report them. Only Tripoli et al. 29 compared endometriosis patients with healthy controls using the WHOQOL-bref; patients had significantly worse scores in the physical and ENDOMETRIOSIS AND QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION 405 psychological domains and in overall QoL. Likewise, women with endometriosis had lower PCS and MCS scores than controls in studies that used the SF-12 21,22 ; worse scores than controls in all domains except social health and self-esteem in the Duke Health Profile. 30 This suggests that women with endometriosis can have significant impairment in their daily lives; the domain and degree of impairment was variable due to study design, but likely also varies between patients due to individual differences in emotional regulation, coping techniques, support network, and expectations of living with the disease. 39,49 Domains affected by endometriosis differed between studies, but pain and the physical component were major issues. 2,12,18,23,25,27,[36][37][38]41,46 Patients with endometriosis have significantly limited performance in all physical activities 18 ; and pain symptoms were correlated to both the physical and to the mental component of QoL. 12,25,36 There is a general notion that women with more pain have lower QoL, but discrepancies exist as to whether pain frequency or pain intensity play a larger role in QoL. 22,28 Participants in qualitative studies have reported subjective physical functioning as a key component in QoL and pain as the most important issue discussed; mentioning that their ability to function affected other areas of QoL and that pain affected all life domains negatively. 37,38 This was corroborated by previous studies and reinforces the intimate relationship between QoL domains and the multidimentional impact that can be caused by endometriosis. 5,39 Impact of disease on women's QoL was more frequently associated to the presence of specific symptoms (more commonly, pain), and not to the diagnosis of endometriosis per se. Most studies comparing women with endometriosis and patients with CPP due to other causes failed to demonstrate a difference in QoL between groups; additionally, while CPP was independently associated with poor QoL in regression analyses, having endometriosis in itself was not. 21,22,25,28,29 On the other hand, Centini et al. 16 demonstrated that, despite pain having a negative influence in QoL in both groups with CPP, patients with endometriosis had even worse QoL, a difference likely explained by the highest prevalence of central sensitization in endometriosis. Nonetheless, pain and QoL are intimately related and can influence each other. Perceived pain is associated with negative emotions, 18 and pain experiences may be altered by negative mood; as such, physical pain can cause increased psychological stress and difficulties in emotion regulation and in the way patients cope with their symptoms, which in turn deteriorate QoL. 12 Moreover, Petrelluzzi et al. described that increased perceived stress levels were correlated with decreased mental health QoL, further supporting this hypothesis. Both CPP and cyclic pelvic were correlated to poor QoL, 21,22,25 with divergent results as to which plays a larger role. This is likely due to differences in study design and methods.\nSleep disturbances also appeared to be more related to symptoms than to the diagnosis per se, 46 corroborated by previous study by Nolan et al., 50 who identified sleep disorders in 72% of women with CPP, and Dunlap et al., 51 who also described alterations in sleep stages in women with CPP.\nEndometriosis may influence QoL with age-related differences, with some studies suggesting worse QoL in younger patients. 14 In teenagers studied by Moradi et al., 38 the diagnosis of endometriosis affected mainly social life and concern with the future, reporting a higher number of concerns compared with older women. L\u00f6vkvist et al. 13 observed that younger women with endometriosis reported worse QoL than patients over 40 years. One could reason this may be due to the development of more effective coping mechanisms by older women; however, the same study demonstrated that younger women used coping strategies more frequently. Reasons for this finding are not clear; nevertheless, it is reasonable to think it may be partially explained by the fear of the future in teenagers, by more severe disease occurring in early-onset disease, by decreasing hormonal levels with aging, by attenuation of disease severity in older women who have had more time to undergo treatments, or by a combination of these factors. Contradictory results were found by two authors included in this review, who reported no correlations between QoL score and age. 17,36 Women with endometriosis exercise less, due to symptoms such as menorrhagia and pain, 37 and this may exacerbate the impact of disease on their QoL. Regular exercise can improve sleep quality, 52 thus helping break the vicious cycle related to sleep and pain intensification.\nInterference in QoL was not related to ASRM staging, according to Sepulcri and Amaral 10 and Nunes et al. 9 This is in agreement with the current knowledge that endometriosis staging is known not to correlate with symptoms, 53 and suggests that QoL is indeed also influenced by other variables such as social and psychological factors.\nStudies differed in subject selection (such as selecting consecutive patients or mailing surveys), research settings (hospitals, community), patient characteristics (such as age, ethnicity, and parity), disease staging (ranging from minimal to deeply infiltrating endometriosis), diagnostic method (from previous biopsy reported by patient to surgery performed as part of the study), treatment background (from treatment-free to undergoing previous laparoscopy), presence of control groups (symptomatic or healthy), and QoL assessment (qualitative and through several standardized tools). The use of validated questionnaires allows for more complete assessments, and they are also important in evaluating women's perception of disease impact and treatment effectiveness in clinical scenarios. 2 Therefore, their use should be encouraged. However, more homogeneity is needed, especially concerning what is the best QoL instrument, to make studies comparable.\nStrengths of our review include the fact that we only selected studies where patients had a diagnosis of endometriosis, instead of only presenting with suggestive symptoms and the inclusion of different QoL questionnaires. This review is limited in that patients in selected articles were not required to be free of previous treatments, which likely played an influence on QoL scores; in that studies were limited to publications in Portuguese and English; in that impact on work productivity, sexual life/infertility, and specific psychiatric conditions were excluded; and in the fact that women in most included studies were selected from hospitals and not the community, which can overestimate the impact of disease on their QoL.", "n_publication_ref": 76, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In all of the studies included in this review, QoL scores were not always affected in a homogeneous manner, but they were poorer in the endometriosis group compared to healthy or asymptomatic controls. However, when women with endometriosis were compared to women with similar symptoms (such as CPP) due to other causes, no statistical differences were seen in the majority of studies, showing that these patients have similar QoL scores and that symptoms, especially pain, play a crucial role in deteriorating QoL. Women with endometriosis also have worse sleep quality and more perceived stress, in addition to lower activity levels, than women without the disease. A consensus must be reached as to which is the best instrument for QoL assessment to make studies comparable.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Clinical practice: Endometriosis", "journal": "N Engl J Med", "year": "2010", "authors": "L C Giudice"}, {"title": "Impact of endometriosis on quality of life and work productivity: A multicenter study across ten countries", "journal": "Fertil Steril", "year": "2011", "authors": "K E Nnoaham; L Hummelshoj; P Webster"}, {"title": "", "journal": "Obstet Gynaecol Reprod Med", "year": "2015", "authors": "S Hogg; S Vyas;  Endometriosis"}, {"title": "Creating solutions in endometriosis: Global collaboration through the World Endometriosis Research Foundation", "journal": "J Endometriosis", "year": "2010", "authors": "G D Adamson; S H Kennedy; L Hummelshoj"}, {"title": "Health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis: A systematic review", "journal": "J Ovarian Res", "year": "2012", "authors": "S Z Jia; J H Leng; J H Shi; P R Sun; J H Lang"}, {"title": "Application of the Portuguese version of the abbreviated instrument of quality life WHOQOL-bref", "journal": "Rev Saude Publica", "year": "2000", "authors": "M P Fleck; S Louzada; M Xavier"}, {"title": "Endometriosis doubles the risk of sexual dysfunction: A cross-sectional study in a large amount of patients", "journal": "Gynecol Endocrinol", "year": "2017", "authors": "F Fairbanks; C H Abdo; E C Baracat"}, {"title": "Impact of endometriosis on quality of life and psychological wellbeing", "journal": "J Psychosom Obstet Gynecol", "year": "2016", "authors": "S G Vitale; Vll Rosa; Amc Rapisarda; A S Lagana"}, {"title": "Prevalence of fibromyalgia and quality of life in women with and without endometriosis", "journal": "Gynecol Endocrinol", "year": "2014", "authors": "F R Nunes; J M Ferreira; L Bahamondes"}, {"title": "Depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life in women with pelvic endometriosis", "journal": "Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol", "year": "2009", "authors": "R P Sepulcri; V F Amaral"}, {"title": "Evidence-based practice in nursing and healthcare", "journal": "Lippincott Williams & Wilkins", "year": "2015", "authors": "B Melnyk; E Fineout-Overholt"}, {"title": "Physical pain and emotion regulation as the main predictive factors of healthrelated quality of life in women living with endometriosis", "journal": "Hum Reprod", "year": "2017", "authors": "G Marki; A Bokor; J Rigo; A Rigo"}, {"title": "Agerelated differences in quality of life in Swedish women with endometriosis", "journal": "J Womens Health", "year": "2016", "authors": "L L\u00f6vkvist; P Bostrom; M Edlund; M Olovsson"}, {"title": "Impact of endometriosis on quality of life, anxiety, and depression: An Austrian perspective", "journal": "Arch Gynecol Obstet", "year": "2015", "authors": "F Friedl; D Riedl; S Fessler"}, {"title": "Sexual function in women with deep endometriosis: Correlation with quality of life, intensity of pain, depression, anxiety, and body image", "journal": "Int J Sex Health", "year": "2015", "authors": "I Melis; P Litta; L Nappi; M Agus; G B Melis; S Angioni"}, {"title": "Chronic pelvic pain and quality of life in women with and without endometriosis", "journal": "J Endometr Pelvic Pain Disord", "year": "2013", "authors": "G Centini; L Lazzeri; D Dores"}, {"title": "Importance of quality of life assessment in patients with endometriosis", "journal": "Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet", "year": "2012", "authors": "F P Minson; M S Abrao; Sarda Junior; J Kraychete; D C Podgaec; S Assis; F D "}, {"title": "Salivary cortisol concentrations, stress and quality of life in women with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain", "journal": "Stress", "year": "2008", "authors": "K F Petrelluzzi; M C Garcia; C A Petta; D M Grassi-Kassisse; R C Spadari-Bratfisch"}, {"title": "Health related quality of life and quantitative pain measurement in females with chronic non-malignant pain", "journal": "Eur J Pain", "year": "2005", "authors": "B S Laursen; P Bajaj; A S Olesen; C Delmar; L Arendt-Nielsen"}, {"title": "The MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dienogest in Chinese women. Patients and Methods: This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter (n = 23) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 mg dienogest once daily in 255 Chinese women aged 18-45 years with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and an endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) score \u202130 mm on a 0-100 mm visual analog scale. The primary efficacy variable was absolute change in EAPP from baseline to week 24. Secondary efficacy variables included proportions of responders and intake of supportive analgesic medication. Safety variables included adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, and bleeding patterns. Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated in a subset of 140 women. Results: After 24 weeks of treatment, the difference between treatment arms for mean reduction in EAPP was statistically significant in favor of dienogest (-24.54 mm; 95% CI -29.93 to -19.15; p < 0.0001). Secondary efficacy analyses supported the significant superiority of dienogest over placebo. Dienogest was well tolerated, with few AEs associated with therapy. Dienogest had no effect on BMD levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: Dienogest 2 mg once daily for 24 weeks was superior to placebo in reducing EAPP and was safe and well tolerated in Chinese women with endometriosis. The results are consistent with studies previously conducted in European women.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "E ndometriosis is a chronic, sex hormone-dependent inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. [1][2][3] Many women with endometriosis experience chronic and acute pain, including pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea) and sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). 4,5 Endometriosisassociated pelvic pain (EAPP) typically has a substantial impact on quality of life and is the primary reason for women seeking treatment. 6,7 The reported prevalence of endometriosis in populations of reproductive age ranges from 2% to 10%. 8,9 Although the precise etiology of endometriosis is unresolved, it is widely accepted that ectopic growth of endometrial-like tissue is driven by locally elevated estradiol concentrations. 1 Consistent with the data implicating elevated estradiol levels in pathogenesis, a range of hormonal therapies that suppress estradiol levels has been shown to provide clinical benefit in endometriosis, including combined oral contraceptive pills, progestins, antiprogestagens, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and aromatase inhibitors. 5,10 While effective, agents in each of these classes are associated with typical adverse profiles. For example, GnRH agonists are associated with symptoms of estrogen deprivation and loss of bone mineral density (BMD) that limit long-term use in the absence of add-back estrogen therapy, while combined oral contraceptive pills-although recommended in a number of management guidelines-are not approved for endometriosis treatment in most countries because of the low quality of the trial evidence. 3,5,[11][12][13][14] Progestins approved for the treatment of endometriosis are in general associated with irregular menstrual cycles, weight gain, breast tenderness, and, with exception of norethisterone, with an adverse impact on BMD at clinically effective concentrations. 12,15,16 Dienogest is an oral progestin with a unique pharmacological profile that combines potent progestogenic efficacy and moderate estrogen-suppressive effects to effectively reduce the growth of endometrial-like tissue, combined with anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects. [17][18][19][20][21] In clinical trials performed in Europe and Japan, dienogest has provided pain relief significantly superior to placebo 22,23 and equivalent to the GnRH agonists leuprolide acetate 24 and buserelin, 22 with tolerability advantages over these GnRH agonists. 25,26 The long-term efficacy and safety of dienogest 2 mg daily have been confirmed in Caucasian and Japanese women with endometriosis, demonstrating maintained pain relief and low rates of treatment-related discontinuations over treatment periods up to 52 weeks. 27,28 A recent 52-week trial in adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) also reported favorable safety and efficacy outcomes in that age group. 29 The aims of this 24-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 study were to investigate the efficacy and safety of dienogest 2 mg once-daily treatment in Chinese women with endometriosis and to seek marketing authorization in China (NCT01822080).

Clinically significant abnormal findings on transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound were reported in 52 women (41.3%) in the dienogest arm and in 63 women (49.6%) in the placebo arm at baseline. At week 24, 45 (38.8%) and 60 (50.8%) women, respectively, had clinically significant abnormal findings. Endometriomas in the right ovary increased from 21.0% at baseline to 32.1% at week 24 in the placebo arm, while decreasing from 26.6% to 22.1% in the dienogest arm. Endometriomas in the left ovary were unchanged from 23.5% at baseline to 23.0% at week 24 in the placebo arm and decreased from 19.6% to 13.0% in the dienogest arm.

It may therefore be concluded that the mechanisms of efficacy that are proposed for dienogest in other populations with endometriosisnamely, estrogen-suppressive effects that reduce growth of endometrial-like tissue, together with anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects-apply also to Chinese women with endometriosis.\nNo new safety signals were detected during dienogest treatment in the Chinese women with endometriosis compared with earlier studies. The incidence of AEs in the dienogest arm was at placebo levels, the intensity of AEs was mild-to-moderate in most women, and the AE-related discontinuation rate (1.6%) was low, consistent with previous observations. 23,24,26 Mean estradiol levels were moderately suppressed and dienogest had no evident effect on BMD, in agreement with observations in adult Caucasian and Japanese women with endometriosis. 23,27,37 This moderate suppression of E2 fulfills the estrogen threshold hypothesis proposed by Barbieri, by which the optimal therapeutic window for endometriosis is achieved by suppression of estrogen levels sufficient to inhibit growth of endometriotic lesions but moderate enough to prevent hypoestrogenic side effects, such as bone mineral loss. 38 The absence of effect of dienogest on BMD is clinically relevant, because it does not limit the treatment duration, unlike for other hormonal treatments such as GnRH agonists. 24,26,28 The mean frequency of bleeding/ spotting episodes was lower in the dienogest than placebo arm, while the length of bleeding/spotting episodes was longer initially with dienogest than placebo, but decreased during continued dienogest treatment, as reported in Caucasian cohorts. 26 A limitation of the double-blind phase of this study is the relatively short (24-week) treatment duration, as prolonged placebo treatment would be difficult to justify in women experiencing chronic pain. An open-label, 28-week extension of the study was ongoing during article development and will provide insights into the longer-term efficacy and safety of dienogest in Chinese women with endometriosis. Strengths of the study include the comparison of active treatment versus placebo in a double-blind design, the use of multiple efficacy and safety measures based on previous trial experience, and the inclusion of adequate numbers of women with endometriosis representative of treatment in general clinical practice.\nIn conclusion, dienogest 2 mg once-daily treatment for 24 weeks in Chinese women with endometriosis was significantly superior to placebo in reducing EAPP and other symptoms, was well tolerated, and was associated with high improvement rates assessed by physicians and high patient satisfaction rates. The effectiveness of dienogest in the Chinese population is consistent with previous studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese populations. 22,24,[26][27][28]37 An open-label, 28-week extension of this 24-week double-blind study was ongoing while the current article was created and will provide insights into the long-term safety and efficacy of dienogest 2 mg once daily in Chinese women with endometriosis.

We sought to compare the incidence of developing commonly occurring comorbidities among patients with and without endometriosis in a large, contemporary patient cohort that reflects real-world clinical practice. Materials and Methods: A cohort of women aged 18-49 with incident endometriosis was extracted from the 2006-2015 de-identified Clinformatics \u00d2 DataMart commercial insurance claims database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN). Endometriosis was identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code 617.x on \u20211 inpatient or emergency department claim or \u20212 outpatient claims. Nonendometriosis control patients were exactly matched 4:1 to cases based on state, insurance plan type, and age (-1 year).

The risk of developing a comorbidity post-index date was analyzed with stratified Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were 26,961 cases and 107,844 controls. Mean age was 36 years. The adjusted risk of developing a comorbid condition among endometriosis cases was statistically significantly higher than the matched controls for all 22 comorbidities (p \u00a3 0.001) and was at least twice as large for nine comorbidities (infertility/ subfertility, ovarian cyst, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disorder, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation/dyschezia, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer).The incidence of developing many comorbidities was significantly higher among endometriosis patients compared with matched women without endometriosis. Additional research is needed to establish the implications for healthcare resource use.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "E ndometriosis is a clinical condition characterized by the presence of hormonally responsive endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus. It manifests with symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. [1][2][3] In the United States, endometriosis is the third leading cause of gynecologic hospitalization, 4 and one of the main causes of infertility in women. 1,5 While it is difficult to assess accurately, 6 the estimated prevalence of endometriosis ranges between 6% and 10% among women in their reproductive years. [7][8][9] Endometriosis is associated with decrements in quality of life and work productivity. 3 However, due to the nonspecific nature of symptoms associated with endometriosis, diagnosis is often delayed. 2,3,10,11 Patients are eventually diagnosed on average about 7 years after symptom onset, at which time they typically have accrued a substantial burden of disease. 3,10,12,13 It is not surprising, then, that relative to individuals without a diagnosis of endometriosis, those with an endometriosis diagnosis have higher medical spending in the periods both before and following the diagnosis. 12,14 In addition, the cost of surgical procedures related to endometriosis places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. One study estimated that the annual costs of healthcare were significantly higher for patients with endometriosis than controls, and the cost difference was $26,305 over 10 years: $7,028 in the 5 years before diagnosis and $19,277 in the 5 years after. 14 Another study reported that 65% of commercially insured endometriosis patients received an endometriosis-related surgical procedure within 1 year of the initial diagnosis, with therapeutic laparoscopy (31.6%) being the most common procedure, followed by abdominal hysterectomy (22.1%) and vaginal hysterectomy (6.8%). Average costs ranged from $4,289 for diagnostic laparoscopy to $11,397 for abdominal hysterectomy. 15 Despite its high prevalence and disease burden, the etiology of endometriosis has not been established definitively. Two recent reviews of the epidemiological literature revealed a number of factors associated with the development of endometriosis, including genetic profile, inflammation, hormonal activity, increased exposure to menstruation, immunological dysfunction, and environmental toxicants. 2,16 Furthermore, the reviews indicated that endometriosis is associated with higher rates of a variety of conditions, including ovarian and other gynecological cancers, thyroid cancer, autoimmune diseases, asthma/atopic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. 2,16 Although recent studies using larger datasets have expanded the evidence base, [17][18][19][20][21] it remains fragmented, with most studies considering only one or a few comorbidities at a time. Thus, there is a need to examine the associations between endometriosis and a broad set of potential co-occurring conditions in the same large, contemporary cohort. Such an examination offers multiple benefits, including informing clinical surveillance, helping to develop prevention and early detection guidelines, and improving patient outcomes. 9 Accordingly, we sought to estimate the incidence of developing potentially common comorbidities among patients with and without endometriosis, hypothesizing that patients with endometriosis have a greater comorbidity burden.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This analysis relies on data from a large, retrospective database of commercial insurance claims covering 2006 through 2015.

Absolute incidence rates were lower and hazard rate esti-mates were in general nominally larger in the sensitivity analyses than in the main results.\nAfter limiting endometriosis patients to those with a claim for a laparoscopy during the 30 days immediately before or after the earliest endometriosis claim in the second sensitivity analysis, there were 6,141 cases and 24,564 matched controls (Table 4). For 18 of the 22 comorbidities, the risk of developing that comorbidity was statistically significantly larger among endometriosis patients than their matched controls, and the estimated hazard ratios for 16 of these 18 conditions were nominally as large or larger than those from the full sample. The hazard ratios for eczema/dermatitis, mood disorder (manic/bipolar), stress, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/rheumatoid arthritis (RA)/Sjogren's/ multiple sclerosis were no longer statistically significantly >1, while the hazard ratios for fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism/thyroiditis were statistically significant but attenuated relative to the full sample results.

The differences grew larger 1 year after index date (e.g., 78% vs. 28%, respectively, for \u20213 comorbidities) and 2 years after index date (e.g., 85% vs. 39%, respectively, for \u20213 comorbidities).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Compared with matched sets of women without endometriosis, patients with endometriosis had higher incidence of developing each of the 22 comorbidities considered, and for 9 of them, incidence rates were at least twice as high among endometriosis patients. These results affirm that endometriosis is accompanied by a large constellation of related conditions; the share of endometriosis patients with at least three comorbidities grew from 65% at diagnosis to 78% 1 year later and 85% 2 years later. Furthermore, patients in the study cohort had on average 2 years of follow-up; as the follow-up period lengthens, it is likely that the comorbidity burden will increase. This is aligned with findings from another endo-metriosis comorbidity study that used administrative claims, where women with an endometriosis diagnosis recorded significantly higher prevalence of comorbid conditions such as infertility (sevenfold), interstitial cystitis fourfold), irritable bowel syndrome (2.6-fold), abdominal pain (2.5-fold), and migraines (2.2-fold) than the general adult female population. 12 Some of this study's findings are not surprising as they confirm well-known relationships between endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. Previous studies have shown temporal associations between endometriosis and subsequent pelvic pain, ovarian cysts, and infertility. 2,5,16 Endometriosis-related pelvic pain might reasonably trigger diagnostic cascades that could lead to the detection of ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids. Likewise, women with endometriosis who complained of pelvic pain could have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome or other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as dyschezia or interstitial cystitis, based on their frequency of symptoms, referral to a gastroenterologist, or misdiagnosis of endometriosis symptoms.\nThe evidence base for connections between endometriosis and other conditions is less well-established but growing. The presence of endometriosis has been associated with the development of ovarian cancer [28][29][30] In particular, between 17% and 44% of patients with endometriosis have ovarian endometriotic cysts, which may be a precursor lesion of ovarian cancer. 30 At nearly $100,000 in the first year after diagnosis and over $8,000/year thereafter, ovarian cancer is especially expensive to treat, with a high degree of associated morbidity and mortality. 31 Besides ovarian cancer, recent studies have documented increased risk of developing gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and constipation/dyschezia. 2,16 In addition, the significant positive associations among endometriosis and breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and autoimmune diseases that were found in this study build on mixed epidemiological evidence. 2,23 In our study, besides pelvic inflammatory disorder, the highest risk comorbidity in women with endometriosis was the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. This finding is expected, as studies have shown a high association between the two. [32][33][34] At the same time, the associations reported in this study are based on retrospective analysis of administrative data. Compared with our estimates, other studies with more detailed, prospective data collection found smaller or no associations among endometriosis and endometrial cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, 19,35 and breast cancer. 21 (Risk estimates from other prospective studies were similar to those reported in this study for systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, however. 17,18 ) One potential source of observed differences in our estimates is reverse causality. Our analytic approach included a year-long wash-out period before the endometriosis diagnosis date to attenuate concerns that comorbidities might precede endometriosis. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, however, especially considering the delay from initial (but unobserved) disease onset to appearance in insurance claims. Residual confounding may also play a role; our use of administrative claims data enabled large samples of patients and outcomes at the cost of less detail about patient characteristics than was available in the epidemiological studies. A third contributor might be the difference in outcome measurement. Existing studies examined clinically confirmed comorbidity diagnoses, whereas comorbidity onset in our study was detected by the occurrence of one or two insurance claims with a comorbidity diagnosis code (with little impact on the results). While less likely when a patient has two or more comorbidity claims, some of these codes could reflect clinicians' suspicions or ruleout diagnoses, which would lead to comorbidity risk inflation.\nOur study documented associations between the diagnosis of endometriosis and the development of subsequent Patients were excluded if they had a claim with the focal comorbidity before the index date.\nOutcome was defined as time to first of at least two claims with the focal comorbidity after the index date.\nCrude incidence was measured per 1,000 person-years. Adjusted hazard ratios were taken from stratified Cox proportional hazards models where strata were the patient matches based on age, state, and insurance type. Models also controlled for 15 Charlson-Deyo comorbidities measured during year before index date: rheumatologic disease; diabetes (mild to moderate); diabetes with chronic complications; myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure; peripheral vascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; dementia; chronic pulmonary disease; peptic ulcer disease; mild liver disease; hemiplegia, paraplegia; renal disease; moderate or severe liver disease; and AIDS.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMORBIDITY INCIDENCE IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS 1119", "text": "comorbidities. Any implications of these results on clinical practice depend on the extent to which they reflect an underlying causal mechanism, and further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. Although the causal direction and pathways between endometriosis and its comorbidities are uncertain, it is likely that treatment for comorbid conditions plays a role in increasing the overall economic burden of endometriosis-related healthcare costs.\nOne study of data from 2003 examined the impact of a narrow and arbitrarily selected list of comorbidities and found that endometriosis patients with comorbidities of interstitial cystitis, depression, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, abdominal pain, and infertility had substantially higher medical spending. 12 A more recent search of the literature uncovered a broader set of conditions that co-occur with endometriosis and are associated with increased medical costs. 25 Our finding that 22 comorbidities occurred more commonly in women with endometriosis than their matched controls suggests that a sizeable portion of spending on treatment for patients with endometriosis may be related to their heavy comorbidity burden. One next step to understand the implications on patient outcomes, resource use, and costs, better would be to pinpoint the incremental contribution of specific comorbidities, while assessing which combinations of comorbidities co-occur most frequently. Another would be to assess the impact of improved treatment of endometriosis on incremental treatment costs for subsequent comorbidities.\nThis study adds to the evidence base for the epidemiology of endometriosis comorbidities 2,6,16 in three important ways. First, it makes use of a large administrative database that has recent claims, has broad geographic coverage, and includes a decade's worth of longitudinal data in the United States. Second, it considers a broad list of candidate comorbidities that was guided by prior literature and expert opinion. Third, this study augments the existing research that connects pain disorders with immune dysfunction disorders 17,[36][37][38] and various cancers. 19,21,[28][29][30]35 This study has several limitations. First, given the use of observational data, it is not possible to determine whether associations between endometriosis and comorbid conditions are causal. One concern is that documented comorbidities may be more common among endometriosis cases than controls because endometriosis patients had more contact with clinicians, particularly obstetrician-gynecologists. As mentioned above, reverse causality and residual confounding may also play roles. Importantly, this study does not explore the possible influence of patient race and socioeconomic Patients were excluded if they had a claim with the focal comorbidity before the index date.\nOutcome was defined as time to first claim with the focal comorbidity after the index date.

Both surgical and medical interventions for endometriosis are associated with recurrence rates. [40][41][42] It is possible that hormonal interventions for endometriosis might have secondary effects on the development of comorbidities. Third, it was not possible to confirm whether a case patient truly had endometriosis, which requires the histology of surgically removed lesions and is done for only a subset of patients. 22 Consistent with prior work, endometriosis patients in this study were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. 12 A subgroup analysis limited to endometriosis patients with laparoscopy claims and their matched controls yielded qualitatively equivalent findings, however.\nFourth, claims data have many shortcomings, including limited clinical detail, limited and variable follow-up for patients, possible coding errors and omissions, and the inability to validate the onset and presence of medical conditions.\nFifth, the patient sample was constrained to commercially insured patients with at least 2 years of continuous enrollment from a single payer's experience. Generalizability to the overall female population of reproductive age is therefore limited in important ways, particularly with respect to the experience of women without insurance and those covered by Medicaid.\nIn this retrospective study of a large, contemporary cohort of commercially insured individuals, the incidence of developing each of a large number of comorbidities was significantly higher among endometriosis patients compared with matched women without endometriosis, and, as a result, women with endometriosis had larger numbers of comorbidities than did controls. The nature of the mechanism(s) responsible for the associations reported in this study is unknown. This study cannot distinguish whether endometriosis and its comorbidities share a common dysfunction or alternatively whether having endometriosis leads to subsequent comorbidities.

Little research has been done to measure its psychometric properties by sex. Previous researchers have established the validity of a three-factor structure, but it is unknown whether it applies to both men and women equally. Materials and Methods: This study examined 198 participants; women (n = 104), men (n = 94) who were participants in the Diabetes Sleep Treatment Trial, an ongoing study examining the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation, scree plots, parallel analysis, and Eigenvalues confidence intervals were all computed to determine factor structure using the seven components measured in the PSQI. Results: Component one, a question about perceived sleep quality, loaded with ''sleep efficiency'' and ''sleep duration'' in men and with ''daytime dysfunction '' and ''sleep disturbances'' in women.  Conclusion:  This study confirms a three-factor structure as previously suggested; however, ''perceived sleep quality'' may load differently depending on the sex being examined. This result suggests that men and women may interpret what is meant by ''overall sleep quality'' differently.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W hile many people talk informally about how well they slept, the concept of what composes ''sleep quality'' is difficult to define and harder to measure because of its inherent subjective characteristics. Yet, poor sleep quality can be an important symptom of sleep disorders and is associated with mood disorders, anxiety and depression, and frequently accompanies serious medical illnesses. 1 The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 1 was developed as a measure of sleep quality to determine when impaired sleep quality becomes pathological in nature and needs further evaluation, or to evaluate the response of treatment of sleep disorders. Since its inception, the PSQI has been accepted as the standard instrument to measure sleep quality with over 2272 citations listed in PubMed alone.\nNo factor analysis was conducted in the initial validation of the study as it was intended to determine the overall concept of sleep quality and to be used as a single global measure. Validation of the instrument was conducted by calculating validity, test-retest reliability, and internal homogeneity. Questions included in the PSQI were obtained from prior sleep instruments, clinical judgment and expertise, and were then honed by its use over 18 months. Overall the scale was found to do well in all three measures. 1 Since the development of the PSQI, many researchers have conducted a factor analysis of the PSQI, arriving at a one, two, or three factor model depending on the characteristics of the sample population. 2 According to a recent systematic review of validation studies of the PSQI, in studies examining its factor structure, 8 out 11 studies reported that one factor was not adequate to represent overall sleep quality. 2 Perhaps the most well-known study was conducted in a sample of older adults (>60 years). 3 Cole et al. 3 proposed a three-factor structure consisting of (1) perceived sleep quality; (2) sleep efficiency; and (3) daily disturbance.\nGiven that there is broad evidence of sex differences in the effects of sex hormones on sleep mechanisms, as well as in circadian clock genes, respiratory function, and stress responses, it is likely that conceptual sleep quality is different in men and women. Premenopause, women have a later circadian rhythm than men. This may be a factor in women's greater propensity to insomnia. 4 Sleep debt also accumulates more quickly in women and it takes longer for women to recover. 4 Women who experience sleep debt may be at higher risk for cardiovascular or metabolic complications. 4 Data suggest that after menopause, women report worse sleep quality than men. 5 Women and men also report different functional outcomes from poor sleep quality including worse mood and lower daytime energy. 6 Research also suggests that women report, and possibly experience, different symptoms of impaired sleep. 7 Because women's sleep differs substantially from men, Mallampalli and Carter 8 reporting from a roundtable of interdisciplinary experts at the Society for Women's Health in 2013, suggested that screening instruments be developed specific for sleep patterns in women. Toward this objective, an examination of the gendered patterns and perceptions of sleep was conducted in an established instrument, the PSQI, to see whether there might be an instance where there were sex differences in the perception of sleep quality.\nAdditionally, the effects of impaired sleep potentially complicate self-management behaviors, and contribute to increased risk and poorer outcomes in persons with type 2 diabetes. Poor sleep quality has been implicated in increased risk for type 2 diabetes. 9 Recent longitudinal data from the Nurses' Health Study confirm an association with measures of sleep quality including difficulty sleeping and short sleep duration and a risk for sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes in women. 10 One cross-sectional study suggested that daytime sleepiness has a greater effect on women's daytime energy than men's daytime energy, which may contribute to risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. 6 Finally, women with type 2 diabetes suffer greater cardiovascular complications than men with type 2 diabetes suggesting this is a crucial area for study. 11 There is a lack of consistency in the few studies that have examined sex differences in the PSQI. 2 While the concept of sleep quality is an accepted clinical construct and is a topic of much fascination in the average person's daily life and conversation, it is likely to be perceived differently by different individuals and within different populations. No known studies have examined a factor structure of the PSQI by sex. Due to the known sex differences in the mechanics of sleep and studies that suggest women report different symptoms of sleep impairment than men, it was hypothesized that men and women will report perceptual differences in sleep quality. The purpose of this study is to examine possible sex differences in the factor structure of the PSQI in a sample of people with type 2 diabetes who were recruited because of their selfappraised impaired sleep.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh.

All participants were recruited from the community and were telephone screened before a baseline assessment.

The means of all seven components measured in the PSQI per men and women can be found in Table 2. There were significant differences in the sample by sex in age, race, and marital/partnership status.\nThe Barlett's test of sphericity and the KMO statistic were assessed to determine whether the sample was appropriate for factor analysis. The KMO statistic exceeded 0.60 in all samples and the Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant ( p < 0.001) in all samples meaning that the sample was appropriate for a factor analysis. 13 ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Reliability and construct validity", "text": "For the sample of men, the PSQI demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.715) meeting the minimum condition for good reliability; for women (Cronbach's a = 0.674) and the total sample (Cronbach's a = 0.695) approached good internal consistency. Inter-item correlation matrices show none of the components to be above 0.80 indicating little or no redundancy. Habitual sleep efficiency and sleep duration (r = 0.608) were more highly correlated in men than in women (r = 0.363). A Fishers r to z transformation confirmed this as a significant difference between men and women in this sample ( p < 0.05). Additionally, sleep duration is much more highly correlated with perception of sleep quality in men (r = 0.515) than in women (r = 0.245). Sleeping medications were the least correlated with all the other components except for sleep latency and in many instances were not significant.\nTo ensure adequate differentiation and maximize factor loadings of the seven components, an orthogonal rotation (Varimax) was chosen to closely examine the factor structure. Using the principal components analysis (PCA) and varimax rotation, we determined a three-factor structure for both male and female samples (Table 4). We found similar results when comparing them to a Promax rotation. While the sample size was modest, factors loadings of >0.64 indicated potential latent variables. Factor one very clearly demonstrated a latent variable (Eigenvalue's 2.6-2.9) accounting for 37%-40% of the variance (Table 3).\nAn Eigenvalue of one is considered the cutoff for factor inclusion but may not be accurate approximately one-third of the time. 17 Therefore, it was less clear whether factors two and three were latent variables as their values, while greater than one, were not substantially greater than one (Table 4). Further analysis was conducted to determine whether they were additional factors. Scree plots, which look for natural breaks in data, 17 were examined and each confirmed the same three-factor structure in both men and women. In addition, parallel analysis, using randomly generated data, was conducted separately for men and women. In parallel analysis, any randomly generated Eigenvalues that are greater than Eigenvalues generated from the data indicate that the factor is not meaningful. 15 In this data, Eigenvalue means for men were greater than the randomly generated eigenvalues in factor's one and three thus corroborating these two factors in the sample of men. For women, only factor one generated a mean Eigenvalue greater than the randomly generated  *p < 0.05, All scores range 0-3.

Because parallel analysis did not completely confirm a three-factor structure in men and women, we also investigated Eigenvalue confidence intervals. 13 This method only demonstrated one latent variable in both the male and female samples (factor one). Out of the four types of factor analysis we computed, PCA and scree plots confirmed a three-factor structure. Parallel analysis partially confirmed the factor structures found in the PCA, and Eigenvalue confidence intervals did not confirm a three-factor structure.\nWe then looked to the literature for suggestions for the best fit of factor structure for our data. Cole et al. 3 also found a three-factor structure in a sample of older adults very similar to our three-factor structure. In their analysis, the only difference in their factor structure from ours was that the perception of sleep quality loaded with sleep latency and sleeping medications. Since the three-factor structure is established from previous research, and our analysis suggested a very similar factor structure, we believe it to be the best fit for our data for both men and women. Table 4 summarizes the factor structure found in our data. Component one ''perceived sleep quality'' loaded with ''sleep duration'' and ''sleep efficiency'' in men and but in women ''perceived sleep quality'' loaded with ''nighttime disturbances'' and with ''daytime disturbances.'' Otherwise, in both men and women (1) ''sleep duration'' and ''habitual sleep efficiency''; (2) ''sleep latency'' and ''sleep medications''; and (3) ''sleep disturbances'' and ''daytime disturbances'' load similarly to form three factors.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings suggest a three-factor structure similar to the findings of Cole et al. 3 These findings suggest that women and men may perceive sleep quality differently in this sample of people with type 2 diabetes. In women, perceived sleep quality loaded with the components of sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction. In men, perceived sleep quality loaded with sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency. In both sexes, sleep latency loaded with perceived sleep quality (factor loadings >0.32) but was a less robust association for both. These findings suggest that women may equate sleep quality with disturbances of sleep (e.g., baby crying, partner snoring) and its daytime effects such as sleepiness or poor concentration. Men may be more likely to equate sleep quality with sleep duration and sleep efficiency.\nCole et al. 3 described a similar factor structure for a sample of older adults, however, his participants were more likely to equate ''perception of sleep quality'' with sleep latency and the need to take sleeping medications. Cole et al. 3 named the factor that included the components of sleeping medications, sleep latency, and perception of sleep quality, ''perception of sleep quality.'' As the perception of sleep quality does not load with the same components in our sample, we do not believe that the ''perception of sleep quality'' carries the same meaning to our participants. However, our findings are otherwise like Cole et al.'s 3 findings. In summary, we suggest that the component, ''perception of sleep quality'' might load with different components depending on the population being studied; in our sample, it loads differently by sex.\nIt is unclear whether lifestyle and sociocultural factors associated with gender, or whether biological factors play a role in how sleep quality is perceived by men and women. If they define or perceive sleep quality differently, it might account for differences in symptom reports. According the general theory of sex differences put forth by Arnold, 19 sex differences may be expressed differently depending on age, levels of stress and health, environment, genetics, epigenetics, and various other influences that make it difficult to generalize beyond this sample. Therefore, it is unclear whether men and women without diabetes or with normal sleep would respond in a similar manner. For instance, recent research suggests that African Americans suffer worse sleep quality than Whites 20 and that older adults might perceive sleep quality differently. 3 Factors such as race, age, and marital/partnership status were not considered, and they may also affect one's perception of their sleep quality.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, this study suggests that there may be different factor structures for men and women in the PSQI depending on the population being examined.

Although both men and women had threefactor structure similar to each other and to that proposed by Cole et al. 3 the component of ''perception of sleep quality,'' in this sample appears to be interpreted differently by the sexes. This suggests that sleep, sex, and gender researchers need to recognize the possibility of perceptual differences in this concept between the sexes.\nWhile this sex difference will not be found in every sample, even one instance of sex difference in the perception of subjective sleep quality challenges the assumption that men and women always perceive sleep quality alike. Researchers who use the PSQI in either describing the sample, or who are using sleep quality as a measurement of sleep impairment, should be careful to account for sex and gender differences in the perspectives of sleep quality.

While attrition and discrimination have both been proposed as explanations, recent literature has suggested that women's professional motivations, ingrained behavior, and perceptions of organizational support may also play a role. Methods: The authors employed a series of scales informed by the turnover theory (which predicts intent to leave an organization), previously validated and used in business and engineering studies, but rarely used in academic medicine. The authors proposed and tested a multiple regression model to assess predictors (role strain, work-life balance, and organizational climate) for three outcome variables: seeking promotion, seeking leadership, and intent to leave. Results: Survey results from 614 faculty members indicated that gender significantly influenced both promotion and leadership seeking, but not intent to leave. Perceived work-family conflict was negatively correlated with leadership seeking for women, but not for men. Positive views of organizational support and commitment were associated with promotion seeking and persistence for all participants. Role strain was positively correlated with desire for promotion and leadership, as well as with intent to leave. Conclusions: Female faculty may not be leaning in to promotion and leadership roles because of increased role conflict, work-life concerns, and organizational factors; this seems to be more of a factor for female clinical rather than research faculty. Work-family conflict affects male and female faculty differently and should be addressed in efforts to retain faculty and to remove barriers for female faculty seeking leadership opportunities.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T he American Association of Medical Colleges reports that women have comprised more than 40% of students entering medical school classes since the 1990s, 1 and consistent with this finding, 38% of academic faculty in the United States are now female. While this number is well above the 15% critical mass described as sufficient to launch members of underrepresented groups into leadership, 2 only 24% of division chiefs and 15% of department chairs at U.S. academic medical centers are women. 1 Institutional and national programs have helped individual female physician faculty achieve success, but have not greatly changed the percentages of female leaders overall. 3,4 Numerous studies of gender disparities have documented that female faculty possess intellectual capital, credentials, and desire for leadership 5 that equal their male colleagues, suggesting that outright discrimination remains a salient factor in the promotion process. [6][7][8] Other sources suggest that a complex interplay of internal and external motivators, which may include factors such as stereotype threat 9 and a desire for geographic stability, 10 has contributed to the gender leadership gap as well. 11 Some authors further propose a women's leadership ambition gap and implore women to lean in to leadership. 12,13 What is clear from two decades of investigations is that focusing on filling the pipeline and achieving critical mass for women is inadequate for advancing women's promotion and leadership in academic medicine. 3,2,14 The leadership gap between women and men is further widened by the increasing attrition of physicians from academic medicine. [15][16][17] Female physicians disproportionately drop out of academic careers, with role strain [18][19][20][21] and work-life conflict [22][23][24] as contributors, and are consequently significantly underrepresented in senior ranks and leadership positions in academic medicine. 14,25 Taken together, these trends point to both personal and environmental variables that may be experienced differently across gender. The interconnectedness of women leaders in academic medicine and improvements in women's health 25 underscore the importance of such interventions for advancing female physician faculty. Research guided by conceptually sound models is needed to develop evidence-based interventions that can engage and retain physician faculty in academic medicine.\nThe purpose of this study was to identify factors that promote physician faculty engagement and to determine gender differences in these factors. We proposed and tested a conceptual model using the turnover theory, 26 which has shown that individuals with low role strain, high organizational commitment, and favorable organizational support report a lower propensity to leave their environment. 27,28 Fouad et al. studied these predictors in female engineers who either stayed in or left engineering careers and found that those who persisted in engineering careers had greater perceptions of both workplace supports and organizational commitment. 29 Furthermore, Settles et al. 30 explored workplace climate factors' effects on job satisfaction, felt influence, and productivity. They defined felt influence as influence over curriculum decisions, resources, and climate and defined productivity in terms of external grants and peer-reviewed publications, which then translated into promotion as defined by gains in rank. Settles et al. 30 determined that job satisfaction, felt influence, and productivity were all predicted by departmental support, particularly chair leadership, and climate variables.\nThis study was undertaken at one large private medical college as part of an institutional effort to support all faculty members, particularly female faculty, toward advancement in academic rank and leadership positions while retaining these valuable members of the academic medical community. Extant research on physician faculty promotion, leadership, and attrition is dominated by largely descriptive studies that provide summaries and frequencies of physician faculty behaviors, giving less attention to the psychological correlates of seeking promotion, leadership, and intent to leave or stay. We hypothesized that female faculty would endorse both seeking leadership and seeking promotion at lower rates than men and endorse equal or lower rates of intent to leave. This exploratory study employed theoretically derived validated measures and multivariate analysis to investigate psychological factors that have been shown to predict intent to leave and may shed light on promotion and leadership seeking.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this study.\nTo assess faculty experience and aspirations in their academic careers, we used validated measures assessing constructs consistent with the turnover theory. The complete list of scales, their definitions and internal reliability estimates, and scale sources [31][32][33][34][35][36] are summarized in Table 1. We posited four constructs as predictor variables; role strain, workfamily conflict, organizational commitment and support, and departmental commitment and support. For example, to assess faculty's experience of family into work conflict within the larger construct of work-life balance, five scale items from the study by Netemeyer et al. 33 were used, including ''I have to put off doing things at work because of the demands on my time at home,'' and ''Things I want to do at work don't get done because of the demands of my home/family life.'' Participants rated their level of agreement with an item on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Mean responses to scale questions for each participant were calculated, with higher scores indicating more of that factor, for example, more family into work interference. The three outcome variables were leadership seeking and promotion seeking (also assessed on the strongly disagree to strongly agree scale) and intent to leave in 1-2 years, for which faculty were asked to indicate yes, no, or unsure.\nThe authors designed an anonymous web-based survey using Research Electronic Data Capture. Between June and August 2013, an email invitation containing an untraceable hyperlink to the survey was sent to all faculty members at or above the rank of assistant professor. The only required survey questions were the consent question and a question indicating whether faculty self-identified as primarily clinicians or researchers. Methods to maximize the response rate included anonymity, known sender (Medical College of Wisconsin [MCW] Women's Faculty Council), long open-survey period (6 weeks), three reminders with link reembedded, and salience of the issue to especially our female faculty.\nData were analyzed using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software, version 22. A multiple linear regression model was developed, in which variables were sequentially added in a total of six groups of like variables (Fig. 1). Visual inspection of the scatter plots and variable histograms indicated that the residuals were independent and that the variables were relatively normally distributed. Because the study was exploratory, an alpha level of p < 0.05 was set as the significance level, although the data are also reported in terms of practical effect sizes.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Of the 1456 employees who received the web-based link to the survey, 614 usable responses were obtained, representing a response rate of 42% overall. Three hundred eleven men and 227 women indicated their gender in the survey (60 did not report), representing 35% and 43% of male and female faculty, respectively. We were concerned about our relatively low, although not atypical, response rate and therefore searched for response bias in two ways. First, we compared our respondents with the known MCW faculty population. Overall, we had relatively more women responding than men and more professors than associates or assistants (Fig. 2). Professors responded at greater rates than assistant professors. Our lowest percentage response was from male assistant professors at 27% (n = 97). Our highest response was from female full professors at 68%, representing 46 of the 68 female professors at that time. Even this strong response rate still left unequal numbers (46 female vs. 129 male professors answered the survey), reflecting the disparity in numbers of male and female senior faculty. Overall, we had relatively equal numbers with  no obvious faculty groups missing, and we believed it to be a representative sample. Second, we were unable to directly survey nonresponders because of survey anonymity and instead compared the first half of respondents (early responders) with the second half (late responders) to see if they differed; the counts for the respondents by rank and gender for the first and second halves of the survey were nearly identical. We collected self-reported race and ethnicity, but the number of faculty identifying as other than white/Caucasian was so small that we could not make meaningful statements about responses by racial/ethnic group and, thus, this information was omitted from the analyses. Similar to other studies, 13,28,29,37 we hypothesized that both rank (assistant, associate, full professor) and type of faculty (research vs. clinical) would strongly affect both leadership seeking and promotion seeking and that having children would be an impediment to leaving one's field, if not the institution. Although gender differences on the mean responses were analyzed, we also wanted to investigate the effects of our predictor variables on the outcomes without gender's influence; therefore, gender appears as a separate step in the regression analysis immediately following the demographic variables.\nBecause gender emerged as a significant predictor of both promotion and leadership seeking, we performed separate regression analyses for both genders, determining whether predictors for women were different than for men, dropping the gender step from the regression analysis.\nRelationships between study variables and control variables were initially explored using mean comparisons. These results appear in Table 2. Gender differences were found in rank (more men are full professors than women) and having children (90% of men and 77% of women had kids). Additionally, women endorsed using their multiple roles to obtain a more flexible schedule at greater rates than men. In our outcomes, only seeking leadership significantly differed by gender, with women endorsing leadership seeking at lower rates than men.\nNext, we investigated potential gender differences on the outcome variables between self-described research and clinical faculty, hypothesizing that researchers would seek promotion out of necessity to maintain their positions (although there is no time limit a faculty can hold a given rank at the institution under study). The results (Table 3) indicated that while both female researchers and clinicians sought leadership at lower rates than their male colleagues, this disparity was larger in clinical than research women. In promotion seeking, only the clinical women sought promotion at lower rates than men. This finding confirmed our decision to control track (research vs. clinical) in the regression analysis.\nThe results of the hierarchical regression analyses are reported in Tables 4-6 for each of the dependent variables (seeking promotion, seeking leadership, and intention to leave). In the final model, the predictor variables were entered into the regression in five steps (see Fig. 1 ", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Seeking promotion", "text": "Among the control variables, rank was an independent predictor for men, with lower ranks unsurprisingly endorsing greater promotion seeking. However, this accounted for very little of the variance and this step was not a significant predictor. When role strain variables were introduced, 9% of the variance for men was explained, largely through positive associations between role certainty, role conflict, and promotion seeking. The work-family conflict step did not contribute to the variance for either men or women. Organizational variables explained an additional 3% of variance for men. Departmental variables contributed minimal additional variance. The final model for men accounted for 15% of the total variance in seeking promotion, with rank, gender, role conflict, role certainty, and promotional climate showing significant contribution to this variation. Note that the strongest predictors FIG. 2. Respondents as a percentage of MCW faculty.

We hypothesized and found that women would have equal or lower intent to leave the institution than men and would endorse leadership and promotion seeking at lower rates than men. Furthermore, we hypothesized that scales previously used for intent to leave  would also predict leadership and promotion. We found that variables related to perceived organizational support and role strain were salient in nearly all models, while workfamily variables had gender-specific effects in physician faculty's persistence, promotion, and leadership experiences. Several gender differences emerged that we highlight below.\nFirst, in the regression model and in the mean comparisons for clinical faculty, male respondents were more likely than female respondents to seek promotion. Overall, controlling for rank and gender, those with role certainty, more role conflict, and better perceived promotion climate were more likely to seek promotion. Whether or not early career men (and particularly male clinical faculty) are entering academia with greater clarity about their goals and expectations as a faculty member or are receiving more role clarity from the organization merits further investigation. Overall, the regression equations predicted only 15% of the variance for men, and disappointingly, the women's model predicted none of the variance, indicating that there are unmeasured aspects of this variable not captured in the present study. Professional advancement, including promotion seeking, is tied to having informal networks and supports and to garnering sponsorship-someone in a position of power to advocate for one's career advancement-and men are more likely to have more of these resources than are women. [38][39][40] Future studies would do well to include measures of these types of social capital resources as well as investigate women's social integration and collegiality in the academic community. 38 Qualitative investigations of female faculty regarding their promotion seeking and promotion attainment experiences would be particularly informative.\nSecond, results of the seeking leadership model revealed gender differences parallel to those in the seeking promotion model. Unlike the promotion model, however, the leadership model explained 26% of the variance for women and only 12% of the variance for men. Men were more likely to seek leader-ship, which is consistent with the gendered landscape of administrative leadership at the institution in this study, at which only 3 of 29 chairs are female. Higher rank and increased role conflict were associated with leadership seeking for women. Increased role conflict was a significant predictor of leadership seeking in both models, indicating that role conflict is either a driver or a consequence of leadership, capturing the challenges of meeting family needs and career demands that may come with choosing to move up the academic ladder. 41 The salience of family variables for female faculty's seeking leadership experiences is consistent with previous research 25,37,42 and poignant observations raised by Cooke and Laine 43 in their article titled, ''A woman physician-researcher's work is never done.'' Other factors must account for unexplained variance. Factors such as confidence (unrelated to actual skills) might play a role. 44 Alternatively, it is possible that the wording of the survey's leadership question could have complicated the response of female faculty. In seeking to assess leadership ambition, we asked for response to the very direct statement, ''I desire to be promoted to a leadership role.'' Women may respond differently to leadership questions phrased as interest in moving one's department in new directions or in improving department practices rather than statements invoking traditionally androcentric roles regarding leading. 45 There are complex reasons that female faculty, particularly female clinical faculty, are not leaning in to leadership, at least at this institution, and further research is needed to determine why.\nFinally, results from the intent to leave model indicated that although role conflict was positively associated with seeking advancement (promotion and leadership), it was also associated with intent to leave for all respondents. If faculty who are working toward promotion diversify or add to their responsibilities as part of that process (e.g., take on additional leadership, teaching, or research roles), and if those additional activities also increase their role conflict, then that could represent a risk factor for the loss of the very faculty that the academic center desires to retain. Since men hold a greater share of leadership positions in academic medicine, and they may view family-work conflicts as part of an academic career, those men may be less sympathetic to women's need to accommodate their families if they accept a leadership position. As Bickel 38 stated in a recent publication, ''Men's ability to effectively mentor women depends to a great extent on their understanding of the challenges that women disproportionately face in developing their careers.'' These gendered patterns of family-work dynamics, coupled with the association between organizational support and intent to leave, point to the organization's responsibility and accountability in establishing practices that can facilitate embeddedness or a reason to stay, such as a positive promotion climate. It is worth noting that opportunities for advancement are necessary, but not sufficient to increase retention for all faculty members, as promotion climate was not a positive reason to stay for female respondents.\nOur results have several implications for organizational policy and practice aimed at faculty retention and career development toward leadership advancement. Interventions aimed at enhancing physician faculty's planning and confidence for engaging in the intrinsic conflicts in multiple-role management may be beneficial in increasing their embeddedness in academic medicine, particularly for female faculty. 32 This includes recognition of the complexities and stressors associated with simultaneous work and family involvement and the subsequent need for deliberate planning to manage the demands from both domains early in one's career. This may require not only developmental programming for emerging or at-risk faculty but also the engagement of senior faculty in understanding unique work-life balance needs of female faculty as they seek leadership opportunities. These processes may assist in both the retention of valuable faculty talent and the realization of increased opportunities for women's leadership.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "To the author's knowledge, this study was the first to explore academic medicine using the turnover theory, 26 bringing a theoretical approach to an area most often explored atheoretically, and the first to suggest that intrinsic motivations toward leadership and professorship might be obstacles for women's advancement, as well as organizational barriers. Longitudinal studies that identify which factors are predictive of the outcome variables over time would help clarify when and how salient these are over a career. This study employed a cross-sectional research design in a single academic institution, and as such, we are unable to establish causation among the variables, nor able to truly extrapolate to other institutions. Additional work in other institutions would broaden generalizability. Furthermore, while a relatively low response rate might indicate nonresponse bias, it is also typical of email-based studies 46 and representative of both a generally falling survey response rate over the last 10 years 47 and the difficulty of surveying physicians in general. 48 Our checks for bias did not indicate systematic nonresponse. Another limitation was the lack of racial/ethnic diversity in our sample, a concern because racial/ethnic minority female faculty are the most vulnerable groups to inequities in academic medicine. 6,49 Although we were unable to examine racial and ethnic differences among our male and female respondents, future research would do well to investigate the intersections of race/ethnicity and gender relative to faculty engagement.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "The state of women in academic medicine: The pipeline and pathways to leadership 2013-2014.

However, identifying disparities in ART usage may have been hampered by missing race/ethnicity information in ART surveillance. We review infertility prevalence and treatment disparities, use recent data to examine ART use in the United States by race/ethnicity and residency in states with mandated insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF), and discuss approaches for reducing disparities. We used 2014 National ART Surveillance System (NASS) data to calculate rates of ART procedures per million women 15-44 years of age, a proxy measure of ART utilization, for Census-defined racial/ethnic groups in the United States; rates were further stratified by the presence of insurance mandates for IVF treatment. Missing race/ethnicity data (35.6% of cycles) were imputed. Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) women had the highest rates of ART utilization at 5883 ART procedures per million women 15-44 years of age in 2014, whereas American Indian/Alaska Native non-Hispanic women had the lowest rates at 807 per million, compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In each racial/ethnic category, ART utilization rates were higher for women in states with an insurance mandate for IVF treatment versus those without. In 2014, A/PI women had the highest rates of ART utilization. ART utilization for all racial/ethnic groups was higher in states with insurance mandates for IVF than those without, although disparities were still evident. Although mandates may increase access to infertility treatments, they are not sufficient to eliminate these disparities.", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "A pproximately 12% of U.S. women 15-44 years of age have difficulty getting or staying pregnant, and disparities in infertility prevalence and service use by race/ethnicity have been noted. [1][2][3] From 1982 to 2002, infertility, the inability to conceive after 12 months or more of unprotected intercourse, decreased in the United States among white non-Hispanic women, yet increased among black non-Hispanic women. 4,5 Furthermore, black non-Hispanic women of reproductive age were 80% more likely to report infertility, 3 but 20% less likely to receive infertility services than their white counterparts. 6,7 Assisted reproductive technology (ART), procedures where eggs or embryos are handled outside of the body to establish a pregnancy, are costly infertility treatments seldom covered by health insurance and likely subject to disparities in access. 8 This commentary reviews racial/ethnic differences in infertility prevalence and treatment, examines recent national ART utilization rates by race/ethnicity and presence of a state insurance mandate for infertility treatment, and discusses potential approaches for reducing disparities.\nRacial/ethnic disparities in infertility prevalence have been documented and may be due to disparities in conditions known to cause infertility such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). For instance, some racial/ethnic minorities report higher rates of STIs (including STIs leading to pelvic inflammatory disease) compared with non-Hispanic whites. 5,[9][10][11][12] Additionally, delays in accessing infertility care have been described for some racial/ethnic groups. 11 For example, Asian/ Pacific Islander (A/PI) and black non-Hispanic women reported longer durations of infertility 4 and accessed ART at a later age compared with white non-Hispanic women. 13,14 There are also differences in infertility service use, the highest proportion of use occurring among older, collegeeducated white non-Hispanic women with incomes >300% above the poverty level. 15,16 In 1999-2000, the distribution of ART cycles in the United States varied by race/ethnicity with white non-Hispanic women accounting for 85.5% of cycles, followed by Hispanic (5.5%), black non-Hispanic (4.6%), and A/PI non-Hispanic (4.5%) women. 16,17 While data from 2004 to 2006 showed a higher percentage of ART cycles for A/PI women (9.8%) compared with black and Hispanic (both at 6.5%), 18 more recent estimates are lacking.\nRace/ethnicity is often linked with socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access, 19 especially in the United States, where certain racial/ethnic groups may experience residential segregation into neighborhoods with less economic and educational opportunities. 20 Conversely, one study found that socioeconomic factors-but not race-were associated with use of fertility treatments, as women with higher levels of income and education spent more money on fertility treatments than those with lower levels. 21 ART, the most costly infertility treatment, averages $12,400 per cycle and may require multiple cycles to achieve a live birth. 8 With the median U.S. income at $53,657 in 2014, 22 ART can impose a financial burden on couples, particularly if health insurance coverage is limited or nonexistent. 23,24 Insurance coverage of in vitro fertilization (IVF), a common ART treatment, is associated with higher utilization and improvements in practice and outcomes such as the transfer of fewer embryos and lower percentages of multiple births. 24 For instance, the difference in the proportion of women using IVF in the military between black non-Hispanic women and their white non-Hispanic counterparts was lower than the difference between the same two groups in the general U.S. population, suggesting that insurance coverage from the military may reduce disparities in access. 16 Additionally, universal insurance coverage mandates requiring all private insurers provide coverage for IVF were found to expand access to IVF treatment, even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. 25 Currently, 15 states adopted mandates requiring some level of private insurance coverage for infertility services in the United States; however, only 8 states mandate coverage for IVF. The mandates vary, with some states restricting coverage to select infertility diagnoses or ages and some implementing coverage caps. 4 Additionally, employers that self-insure are exempt from state mandates and can comprise much of the employed population.\nWhile many studies on treatment utilization focus on the frequency of ART cycles performed, limited national studies of the ART utilization rate by race/ethnicity exist. Furthermore, many of these studies used older data and were limited by the high percentage of missing race/ethnicity values in ART surveillance data. 26 Therefore, we used 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National ART Surveillance System (NASS) to calculate the number of ART procedures per million women of reproductive age (15-44 years) (a proxy measure of ART utilization based on varying population sizes) for each racial/ethnic category of women. Denominators for these calculations were derived from U.S. Census data. 27,28 To address the high proportion (35.6%) of missing information, multiple data imputation was performed for race/ethnicity using SUDAAN's HOTDECK procedure, under the assumption of missing at random. 29 We also calculated ART utilization by race/ethnicity for women living in eight states with mandated insurance coverage for IVF during 2014 (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) and for states without such coverage.\nIn 2014, A/PI women had the highest number of ART procedures per million women 15-44 years (5883.0) of age followed by white non-Hispanic women (2888.4), whereas black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native non-Hispanic women had lower than the average U.S. ART utilization rates (1434.0, 996.7, 806.8, respectively). ART usage rates were higher in states with insurance coverage mandates for IVF than in states without such mandates, regardless of race/ethnicity (Fig. 1). Affordability may help explain the higher ART utilization rate among A/PI women. According to 2014 U.S. income data, the A/PI population was the highest earning race/ethnic group with a median income of $74,297 22 and had the highest educational attainment compared with other race/ethnic groups. 30 Higher incomes may facilitate access to infertility services, and pursuit of higher education may contribute to childbearing later in life when fertility treatments are more likely to be needed. 31,32 Additionally, some evidence suggests that A/PI women may be affected by premature ovarian aging at higher rates than white women. 33 Although our results suggest that ART utilization was higher in states with IVF mandates regardless of race/ethnicity, in states with a mandate, utilization rates for black non-Hispanic and Hispanic women were still lower than the overall utilization rate for those states, a finding consistent with other studies. 34,35 This disparity may be due to out-ofpocket costs such as deductibles and copayments or factors beyond economics that may also provide barriers to care. 31,35 For example, certain racial/ethnic groups may delay accessing covered services due to cultural factors such as infertility stigma or fear of disappointing a partner. 4,36 The need to address disparities in ART utilization was recognized in the National Public Health Action Plan for the Detection, Prevention, and Management of Infertility; it calls for the provision and monitoring of effective infertility treatment services and/or prevention of conditions leading to infertility disparities. 37 Ensuring complete and accurate data collection on race/ethnicity in surveillance systems that monitor infertility and infertility treatments would aid future studies of disparities in risk factors for infertility and access to and utilization of safe and effective treatment.", "n_publication_ref": 50, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "FIG. 1.

Evaluation of infertility prevention programs, such as the CDC's Infertility Prevention Project 41 or educational efforts aimed at improving ART outcomes in cities and states, 42 may identify effective evidence-based strategies that could help reduce disparities in infertility and its treatment. Additional studies could assess racial/ethnic disparities in cultural and social stigmas surrounding infertility, such as perceived bias from providers, and their impact on ART utilization. 18,31,36,43,44 Burdens from the indirect costs of infertility treatment, such as missed work days and transportation to undergo treatments, could also be assessed.\nIn summary, recent 2014 data showing high ART utilization for A/PI women and lower ART utilization for other minority women point to continued disparities in infertility treatment. While insurance coverage may increase access and address some or all of the cost barriers, strategies that address other cost and noncost factors may be needed to help eliminate utilization disparities.

We examined associations between healthcare provider advice about gestational weight gain and inadequate or excessive weight gain, stratified by prepregnancy body mass index category. Materials and Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from women delivering full-term (37-42 weeks of gestation), singleton infants from four states that participated in the 2010-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (unweighted n = 7125). Women reported the weight gain range (start and end values) advised by their healthcare provider; advice was categorized as follows: starting below recommendations, starting and ending within recommendations (IOM consistent), ending above recommendations, not remembered, or not received. We examined associations between healthcare provider advice and inadequate or excessive, compared with appropriate, gestational weight gain using adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Overall, 26.3% of women reported receiving IOM-consistent healthcare provider advice; 26.0% received no advice.

Sampled mothers are mailed a questionnaire, and those not responding after multiple mailed follow-up attempts are contacted by telephone to complete the questionnaire via interview.\nThe PRAMS questionnaire assesses maternal characteristics and pregnancy-related behaviors and experiences (e.g., contraceptive use and content of prenatal care) and data are linked to select demographic and medical information from the birth certificate (e.g., maternal age and gestational weight gain). Data are weighted to account for survey design, noncoverage, and nonresponse to provide representative estimates of the female population delivering a live birth in each state. The PRAMS protocol has been reviewed and approved by the CDC Institutional Review Board. States included in this analysis approved the analysis plan and met the 65% response rate threshold.\nWe used Phase 6 (2009-2011) data from Colorado, Georgia, Maine, and Utah because these states included optional questions on the PRAMS questionnaire that assessed healthcare provider advice about gestational weight gain.

A nationwide survey of obstetrics/gynecology and family medicine residents in 2010 found 6% correctly identified IOM-consistent gestational weight gain ranges. 25 A small, single-clinic study in 2016 found that obstetricians/ gynecologists', nurse practitioners', and nurse midwives' knowledge of IOM-consistent weight gain ranges varied by prepregnancy BMI category, from 42% identifying the IOMconsistent range for obese women to 83% for normal weight women. 26 Variability in healthcare providers' knowledge of the recommended weight gain ranges, and the observation that most are familiar with the recommended range for normal weight women, may partially explain our finding that 25-35 pounds was the most frequently reported advised weight gain range for all but obese women. In addition to limited awareness or knowledge around the 2009 IOM recommendations, healthcare providers may experience barriers that hinder counseling about gestational weight gain. Insufficient training on nutrition and weight-related counseling, sensitivity around addressing weight-related topics, and perceptions that counseling is ineffective are barriers that have been reported by healthcare providers; addressing barriers may allow providers to feel more prepared to provide IOMconsistent advice. 27 Notably, among women who reported receiving IOMconsistent advice, only 42% had appropriate gestational weight gain; thus, additional counseling and behavior-change strategies may be needed to help women achieve appropriate weight gain. A 2013 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists specifically recommended healthcare providers discuss appropriate diet and physical activity, in addition to gestational weight gain, at the initial prenatal care visit and periodically throughout pregnancy. 28 Importantly, this recommendation is supported by a recent systematic review that found dietary and physical activity counseling was an effective intervention strategy for  preventing excessive gestational weight gain. 29 Most women require no additional calories in the first trimester and an additional 340 and 450 calories a day in the second and third trimester, respectively, to support the metabolic demands of pregnancy. 3 Women can use the USDA SuperTracker to identify foods that meet calorie needs 30 ; however, for some women, referral to a dietitian may be needed to achieve dietary goals that promote appropriate gestational weight gain. 3 Most pregnant women are recommended to achieve 150 minutes per week of moderate to intense physical activity, such as brisk walking. 31,32 In primary care settings, physical activity prescriptions that include details of frequency, duration, and intensity have been found to promote physical activity. 33 Moreover, studies among nonpregnant populations have found that frequent (i.e., at least weekly) self-monitoring of weight is an effective strategy to promote weight control 34 ; thus, the IOM has promoted self-monitoring of weight during pregnancy as a tool to promote appropriate weight gain. 33 Routine self-monitoring of weight gain that begins early in pregnancy allows for detection of inadequate or excessive gain when small, corrective changes can be made. Self-monitoring may also create opportunities for women and their healthcare providers to discuss strategies that may promote appropriate weight gain. 33,34 Weight gain trackers that are specific to a woman's prepregnancy BMI are available online. 35 Aside from patient-centered strategies, public health campaigns that address social norms and raise awareness about benefits of appropriate gestational weight gain may be needed. 33,36 Social norms around pregnancy as an opportunity to freely gain weight (sometimes summarized by the phrase ''eating for two'') may encourage excessive gain by overshadowing messages from healthcare providers about appropriate dietary, physical activity, and weight gain behaviors. 36 Furthermore, raising awareness about weight gain recommendations may encourage women to initiate conversations with healthcare providers about strategies to achieve appropriate weight gain.\nOur study was strengthened by the use of a large, populationbased data set representative of four states, which allowed us to stratify analyses by prepregnancy BMI category and explore a dose/response relationship. We were limited by our measure of healthcare provider advice, which women reported *4 months postpartum and may result in recall bias if influenced by actual gestational weight gain; however, this influence may be limited because weight gain was collected separately on the birth certificate and not at the same time as healthcare provider advice. Indeed, only 20% of women reported an advised weight gain range that included their actual gestational weight gain (data not shown); if recall bias were present, we would expect this proportion to be higher. Healthcare provider advice reported by women may not reflect actual advice from a healthcare provider, but information that women internalize and recall may be most important for influencing behavior. 13 We were unable to distinguish advice from a physician, nurse, or combination of clinicians, nor could we assess timing or frequency of provider advice during pregnancy because these details were not collected.\nWe are also limited by examining healthcare provider advice 1 or 2 years after the 2009 IOM recommendations were released may not have allowed sufficient time for recommendations to translate into practice; however, current and previous recommendations differ only for obese wom-en. 37 Furthermore, healthcare provider advice in 2010-2011 may not reflect current provider practice. Our study was restricted to women delivering full-term (37-42 weeks of gestation) infants, but we were unable to control for weekspecific gestational age in our regression models because this variable was unavailable. Although self-reported prepregnancy weight tends to be underreported, especially among overweight and obese women, 38 studies suggest 76%-84% of women are classified into correct BMI categories using selfreported height and prepregnancy weight. 38,39 Assuming prepregnancy BMI misclassification is nondifferential to healthcare provider advice, our results would likely be biased toward the null. Finally, studies indicate that the prevalence of appropriate gestational weight gain varies by state, which may be related to social or environmental factors, or different healthcare provider practices in different states. 1 While we found no evidence that state modified the association between provider advice and gestational weight gain, our findings may not be generalizable to women in all states.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that healthcare provider advice influences gestational weight gain; however, approximately one-in-four women in 2010-2011 reported receiving IOM-consistent advice and another one-in-four reported receiving no advice about gestational weight gain. Strategies that raise awareness of the 2009 IOM recommendations, address barriers to providing IOM-consistent advice, and broadly promote appropriate weight gain are needed.", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Working Group members for coordinating data collection.

The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of a very low-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003%) applied twice per week in postmenopausal women with VVA-related vaginal dryness. Materials and Methods: In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, postmenopausal women with moderate-severe vaginal dryness as the most bothersome VVA symptom were randomized (1:1) to estradiol cream 0.003% (15 lg estradiol; 0.5 g cream) or placebo (0.5 g cream). Treatments were applied vaginally once daily for 2 weeks followed by two applications/week for 10 weeks. Coprimary outcomes were changes in severity of vaginal dryness, percentage of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells, and vaginal pH at final assessment. Additional outcomes comprised changes in severity of other VVA signs and symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Results: Of the 576 randomized participants, most were white and had an average age of 59 years. At final assessment, estradiol reduced vaginal dryness severity, decreased vaginal pH, increased superficial cell percentage, and decreased parabasal cell percentage versus placebo ( p \u00a3 0.05, all).

[1][2][3] Symptoms include vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and dysuria. 1,2,4 In the large U.S. REVIVE survey of postmenopausal women, the most commonly reported VVA symptom was vaginal dryness (55%) followed by dyspareunia (44%) and vaginal irritation (37%). 3 Lower urinary tract symptoms can also occur after menopause onset in addition to these vulvovaginal symptoms, which led to the 2014 proposal to replace VVA with the more inclusive term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). 1 For the purposes of this article, the term VVA will be utilized to avoid inconsistencies in terminology as U.S. prescribing inserts of treatments discussed herein commonly refer to vulvar and vaginal atrophy rather than GSM.\nWhile the prevalence of postmenopausal women experiencing VVA is over 50%, 2 only 56% of postmenopausal participants with vulvovaginal symptoms in the REVIVE survey reported a discussion of their problem with a healthcare provider, 3 demonstrating that these symptoms are typically underdiagnosed and undertreated. The frequency of vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, flushes, and night sweats declines over time without treatment, but vulvovaginal symptoms are chronic and progressive. 5 Nonhormonal treatments such as moisturizers and lubricants can relieve mild symptoms, but fail to reverse many atrophic signs and have a brief window of effectiveness (<24 hours per use). 2 The 2017 position statement from the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) recommends that estrogen for vulvovaginal symptoms be individualized, offering the most appropriate dose, regimen, duration of use, and route of administration, maximizing benefit and minimizing risk. 5 This approach is consistent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on estrogen treatment for menopause symptoms that recommends using appropriately low vaginal doses. 6 Topical, localized estrogen treatments using delivery modalities such as vaginal tablets, rings, or creams reduce systemic estrogen exposure. 2,7 Estradiol vaginal cream 0.01% (Estrace [Allergan USA, Inc., Irvine, CA], 0.1 mg estradiol/g) is an FDA-approved topical treatment for postmenopausal VVA. 8 The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a very low-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003% estradiol; 15 lg estradiol in 0.5 g cream) compared with placebo vaginal cream (consisting of the same ingredients as above with the exception of estradiol) dosed two times per week in postmenopausal women with VVA signs and vaginal dryness.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP guidelines and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, parts 50, 56, and 312.

The results also demonstrate that local lowdose delivery of estrogen directly to the vagina, even at 15 lg/dose, is a highly effective mode of treatment for postmenopausal women experiencing VVA-associated vaginal dryness. The advantage of this approach is the lack of appreciable increase in systemic estrogen exposure. 5 Improvements in irritation/itching, vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity, and dysuria were similar between estradiol and placebo. In addition, dyspareunia improved similarly in the estradiol and placebo groups (except for greater improvement with estradiol observed at Week 8). This may have been the result of enrolling participants with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome VVA-related complaint at baseline; thus, baseline ratings of sexual activityrelated vaginal bleeding or dysuria were mild or absent in many participants. For example, while a systematic review of vaginal estrogen for VVA treatment found that patients using vaginal estrogen showed improvements in vulvovaginal signs compared with those using nonhormonal moisturizers, there was not enough evidence to conclude that the treatments differed in terms of individual vulvovaginal and urinary symptom improvement. Only patients who had two or more vulvovaginal symptoms showed statistically greater improvement with vaginal estrogen. 10 Another possibility is that the estradiol and placebo used in the present study may have had similar symptom outcomes due to the moisturizing effects of both creams. Regular use of vaginal moisturizers has been shown to be similarly effective to topical vaginal estrogen treatments in relieving mild vulvovaginal symptoms. 11 There is no evidence, however, that these products provide any long-term relief as they do not reverse many atrophic signs. 2,11 In contrast to the FDA-approved vaginal estrogen creams currently on the market, Premarin \u00d2 (0.625 mg/g) 12 and Estrace \u00d2 0.01% (0.1 mg/g), 8 estradiol 0.003% provides a lower vaginal dose of 30 lg/g (15 lg/0.5g in this study) per application, which is similar to the lower dose vaginal estradiol tablets currently available in the US (10-25 lg/tablet). 13 This approach is congruent with the FDA and NAMS recommendations to use the lowest effective vaginal estrogen dose for VVA treatment to reduce systemic exposure. 5,6 Additional justification to prescribe appropriately low estrogen doses is that many postmenopausal women with VVA using a prescription estrogen treatment report have concerns over long-term safety, hormone exposure, and general side effects, 3 and as such, concerns may negatively impact medication adherence. 14 Furthermore, local application of low-dose local estrogen may be an appropriate treatment for some women who have moderate-severe VVA and for whom systemic absorption of estrogen might present greater risk than benefit. 5 Treatment with the estradiol cream was well tolerated as indicated by the similar rates of TEAEs and related discontinuations between the two treatment groups; one exception is that vulvovaginal mycotic infections were more frequent in the estradiol group. This finding was not unexpected and may reflect the impact of estrogen on decreasing vaginal pH, a shift in the vaginal biome, 15 or a direct effect of estrogen on candida species. 16 No serious TEAEs were considered treatment related or led to discontinuations and no deaths occurred. Due to the lack of long-term clinical trial data on endometrial safety with low-dose vaginal estrogen treatment for VVA symptoms, appropriate progestin doses were provided after study participation to those women who had an intact uterus. 5 A limitation of this study is that the majority of the enrolled participants identified as white. Thus, the findings may not be generalizable to all racial/ethnic groups. In addition, estradiol levels were not measured in this study, and therefore, no conclusive statements can be made regarding the systemic  exposure or lack thereof from the topical estradiol treatment. Low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments of \u00a325 lg have been shown to reduce systemic estrogen exposure as opposed to higher doses (50-2000 lg estradiol) 7 and, consequently, it is unlikely that the vaginal estradiol dose utilized in the current study (15 lg/0.5 g) produced significant systemic estrogen levels.\nA strength of this study was the dosing regimen with local estradiol vaginal cream, which starts initially with a daily priming dose for 2 weeks and then decreases the dosing frequency to a lower maintenance level, reflecting current clinical practice. 5 The very low dose contained in the estradiol cream was effective in reducing the severity of vaginal dryness suggesting that it may be a useful treatment option for women who have VVA with this primary complaint.

When comparing screening mammograms with the highest density (extremely dense breasts, \u202175% dense tissue) to those with the lowest density (fatty breasts, <5% or <10% dense tissue), women with the highest density have between a 1.5 and 4.7 increased odds of a breast cancer diagnosis. [3][4][5] The absolute increase in risk, however, is much smaller as density must be taken into consideration with other clinical factors that also contribute to breast cancer risk. [6][7][8] For example, the absolute increase in risk from a woman with no family history of breast cancer, no prior biopsy, and average density compared with a similar woman with extremely dense breast tissue is estimated to be 0.6%. 6 In addition, mammography sensitivity decreases by up to 50% among women with extremely dense breasts versus those with mostly fatty breasts. 1 As such, density is increasingly being incorporated into clinical assessments of breast cancer risk and discussions about risk with patients. 6 Some advocacy groups suggest supplemental imaging for women with dense breast parenchyma to increase the chance that cancers masked by density will be detected before they become symptomatic. Supplemental imaging with breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound (US) after a normal mammogram may reduce the interval cancer rate (rate of cancers detected because of symptoms in the interval between recommended screenings) among women with dense breasts, but these tests also increase false-positive imaging tests and biopsies. 3,9 Early detection in this setting is important since interval cancers, or invasive cancer diagnosed within 12 months of a normal mammogram, are associated with more aggressive tumors. [10][11][12] In response to this emerging evidence, a large grassroots movement 13 has initiated a series of legislative policies to raise awareness among women with dense breasts as a means to promote informed decision-making about supplemental screening. 14 In January 2015, Massachusetts became the 21st state to pass breast density notification legislation. The Massachusetts legislation mandates that women whose mammograms are determined by a radiologist to show ''heterogeneously or extremely'' dense breasts receive a notification including the following eight required informational components 15 : (1) that a woman's mammogram displays dense breast tissue;\n(2) the degree of density and explanation about the given degree of density; (3) that dense breast tissue is common and not abnormal, but may increase one's risk of cancer; (4) that dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to view cancer on a mammogram, rendering the potential need for additional testing to complete reliable breast cancer screening;\n(5) that supplemental screening tests may be advisable and results of the mammogram should be discussed with a woman's physician or primary care physician; (6) that a woman has the right to discuss the mammogram results with either the interpreting radiologist or referring physician; (7) that a report of the mammogram has been sent to the referring physician and is included as part of the patient's medical record; and (8) where additional information about breast dense tissue can be found.\nAt this time, 32 states (including Indiana whose law does not explicitly require notification) have passed some form of breast density notification legislation, with additional states considering bills, and discussion of national legislation. 16 There is, however, controversy about breast density notification legislation, in large part, due to the lack of professional guidelines to support the use of supplemental screening, which many of these laws endorse. National guidelines from the American Cancer Society do recommend annual screening MRI in high-risk women regardless of breast density, 17 but do not recommend supplemental screening with MRI and US in average-risk women with dense breasts. 18 In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) also released updated recommendations for breast cancer screening concluding that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of supplemental screening with US or MRI for women with dense breasts. 19 Of note, the USPSTF guideline process prioritizes outcomes from randomized controlled trials, despite evidence that supplemental screening in certain populations with dense breast parenchyma indeed reduces interval cancer rates and increases rates of cancer detection. 9,20,21 Experts have raised concerns about the legislation's ability to promote informed decision-making and evidence-based care due to concerns about the subjectivity of density assessment, the potential overreliance on density as a risk factor for cancer, as well the potential for notifications to increase patient anxiety, distress or fear, generate uncompensated imaging costs, or even lead to overdiagnosis. 7,[22][23][24][25][26][27] Primary care providers (PCPs), who are at the forefront of decision-making with patients who receive these notifications, are now faced with the challenges inherent in clinical decisionmaking without sufficient evidence to guide them. Despite the widespread adoption of such legislation, little is known about its impact on clinical practice [28][29][30] and the consequences of the legislation on the PCP have only been minimally explored 31 despite many states recommending that women receiving the notification follow up with primary care. Given the limited resources available in primary care, particularly in safety-net settings where providers encounter complex and competing demands, it is imperative that we assess the impact of such legislative initiatives on providers practicing in this setting. Therefore, we conducted a study to describe the perspectives about the breast density legislation among PCPs practicing in two Massachusetts safety-net hospitals (defined as institutions with greater than 25% of their patient population uninsured or covered through Medicaid).", "n_publication_ref": 39, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This descriptive study aimed to explore provider attitudes, knowledge, and the impact of the Massachusetts dense breast notification legislation on clinical practice after its enactment in January 2015.

While most (80%) had at least some familiarity with the legislation, none was able to identify all eight required components of the notification and half of PCPs did not feel prepared to respond to patient questions about dense breasts, with the vast majority indicating interest in further training. Female and less experienced providers were more likely to report being in favor of the legislation and women were more likely to report that it changed their discussions of mammography.\nOur findings in Massachusetts are in contrast to studies of PCPs in California. 31 While 80% of our providers indicated familiarity with the legislation, 49% of surveyed providers in the California study reported no knowledge of their legislation. This is likely due to the recent proliferation of these laws nationally and the increased attention on available scientific evidence on this topic, which may have alerted providers to the coming changes in 2015 in Massachusetts, whereas California adopted the legislation in 2013. However, these study findings were similar in identifying PCPs' discomfort counseling on this topic and a high desire for further training.\nWe found that 38% of our providers favored the legislation, similar to another single-institution study of radiologists in Pennsylvania. 32 These data suggest that a broad spectrum of providers do not favor the law. This low favorability in our study, combined with only 43% of those surveyed feeling breast density counseling was their responsibility, could suggest that PCPs are wary of policies that increase their workload in light of competing health priorities that must be addressed in a clinic visit, although our data did not directly assess this explanation. Concerns about the increased effort required to appropriately address breast density in a visit may be warranted, as others have documented a lack of systems (e.g., Electronic Health Record decision support) that support breast cancer screening in primary care 33 and the need to streamline the supplemental screening process, 34 which may be especially true in safety-net settings with fewer supportive resources.\nAnother potential contributor to providers' lack of support for this legislation is that scientific evidence to support the adoption of supplemental screening is still emerging and controversial, 22 so providers have limited tools to guide shared decision-making for women with dense breasts. 35 The benefits of supplemental US and/or MRI include higher rates of cancer detection and lower rates of interval cancers. 21,[36][37][38][39] USs find 1.1-7.2 additional breast cancers per 1000 screened, resulting in 0.36 averted deaths, but also incurring 47-354 false positives per 1000 screened individuals. 9,20,36,39 Use of supplemental MRI finds an additional 10 cancers per 1000 tests over mammography alone, but has a high false-positive rate of 7%-23% and no established mortality benefit. 21,36,38,40,41 However, these tests are associated with additional costs to individuals and the health system, higher rates of false positives resulting in biopsies with associated potential harms, and are a source of emerging concern regarding overdiagnosis of breast cancer. 20,38,42 Alternatively, primary screening with tomosynthesis leads to lower rates of recall in women with dense breasts, maintaining high specificity and sensitivity, 43 but there is still a paucity of evidence that any of these screening tests leads to improved clinical outcomes, 21 unlike mammography. 19 While data on outcomes related to supplemental screening and/or alternative primary screening modalities for dense breasts continue to be generated, providers can assist patients in weighing the benefits and risks on an individual basis, helping women choose screening modalities based on their individual risk of developing cancer and personal preferences for more or less screening. Primary care is one possible venue for such discussions, as PCPs generally initiate screening recommendations and referrals. However, it is the responsibility of an array of care providers to ensure shared decisionmaking in this setting, and thus, a range of specialties should be prepared to engage in these discussions (e.g., radiologists).\nIndeed, expert panels around the country advocate for the incorporation of risk assessment and personal preferences into screening decisions to guide informed decisionmaking about supplemental screening in the setting of dense breasts. 24,35,44 However, a prior study of PCPs' attitudes and practices surrounding risk assessment and management found that while providers often elicited a family history of breast cancer (71%), very few ever explicitly calculated risk for individual patients (24%). 45 A second study confirmed that PCPs generally limit discussions of breast cancer risk to family and personal history, and are concerned about discussing risk if there are limited options for modifying risk. 46 Others have reported that providers indicate a lack of confidence in knowledge of risk and risk assessment as a barrier to more comprehensive discussions of risk, including tailoring screening by risk status. 45 These studies are congruent with responses to the scenario knowledge question presented here, where a significant minority of respondents (43%) did not indicate risk assessment as the correct course of action. Building the capacity of PCPs to counsel about breast cancer risk in conjunction with breast density is an important but overlooked complement to these legislative efforts, without which the goals of the legislation will remain unfulfilled.\nThe differences observed in terms of attitudes and knowledge between genders and years of clinical practice are also consistent with findings from other settings. It is well documented that gender concordance between female physicians and patients is associated with more preventive counseling and testing, 47,48 as well as higher levels of patient-centered communication. 49 This may, in part, explain why female PCPs in this sample were more likely to be in favor of this legislation and report that it changed their practice, particularly around the discussion of mammography. Providers with fewer years in practice may be more amenable to taking on this counseling responsibility because of an increasing emphasis on informed decision-making in medical education, with the incorporation of skills training such as brief motivational interviewing into medical curricula. 50 The intended effect of breast density notification legislation to increase awareness and promote informed decision-making requires activated and informed PCPs. PCPs participating in this survey in Massachusetts indicated they do not feel prepared to counsel their patients with dense breasts. Raising patient awareness about risk factors without an informed clinical workforce has the potential to lead to increased patient anxiety and confusion about the appropriate course of action.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "These data were collected at two academic safety-net hospitals in one urban area, reflecting the local attitudes and perceptions of the Massachusetts breast density legislation.

These data were collected within 6-10 months after the enactment of the legislation. Changes in perceptions may have occurred over this period, influencing results. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of breast density notification, including the changes in practice over time.

We assessed whether self-perceived adverse psychological factors were associated with achievement of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) as measured by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple Seven (LS7) and whether this differed by sex. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of employees from a large healthcare organization. The LS7 metrics (smoking, physical activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose) were each scored as ideal (2), intermediate ( 1), or poor (0). Total scores were categorized as optimal (11-14), average (9-10), and inadequate (0-8). Using logistic regression, we tested whether psychological factors obtained by questionnaire (self-perceived stress, low life satisfaction, hopelessness, sadness, depression, and anxiety) were associated with CVH, after adjustment for age, ethnicity, and education. Results: Among 9,056 participants, the mean (SD) age was 43 (12) years, 74% were women, 57% Hispanic/ Latino, 17% white, and 16% black.

Low life satisfaction, hopelessness, sadness, and anxiety were also associated with statistically significantly lower odds of optimal/average CVH in women, but not in men; however, there were no interactions by sex.

While there have been declines in CVD rates in both women and men due to the efforts targeted at traditional risk factors, nontraditional risk factors may affect men and women differently and account for the sex differences in CVD presentation and outcomes. 3 Psychosocial stressors, including depression, social, and work stress, are emerging risk factors for the development of CVD 4,5 and are associated with worse outcomes. [6][7][8] Chronic mental stress leads to abnormal levels of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and proinflammatory cytokines that can have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. 9 In addition, chronic stress may result in negative effects on behavior and lifestyle. 9 Women have about a twofold higher prevalence of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety than men and this is accentuated during the menopausal transition. 10,11 Women and men are affected by stress differently, [12][13][14][15] and the magnitude of stress response and the effect on CVD outcomes differ. 7,11,16 Sex hormones may play an important role in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and may be the basis for the sex differences in response to stress. 13 Therefore, interventions targeted at specific and easily measured risk factors such as psychosocial stress may improve sex disparities in CVD outcomes.\nIn 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) set a goal to improve the cardiovascular health (CVH) of all Americans by 20% and to reduce deaths from CVD by 20% by the year 2020 by defining health behaviors and indicators to achieve ideal CVH. 17 Seven easily measured metrics also known as ''Life's Simple Seven'' (LS7) were proposed to define and monitor the prevalence of ideal CVH (smoking status, diet, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose). Given the association of psychosocial stressors with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, we investigated whether self-reported and self-perceived psychological stressors were associated with having inadequate CVH as assessed by the AHA LS7 metrics and whether these associations differed by sex.

We found that there generally were no sex differences in the association of adverse psychological factors and ideal CVH; there were no significant interactions by sex except for low life satisfaction and ideal metrics, which appeared to be a stronger risk factor in women than in men. In addition, there were no interactions by age <50 and \u202150 in women. Our exploratory findings suggest that psychosocial stress may be an additional pathway in increasing vulnerability to CVD, but further work is needed to determine if psychosocial interventions can improve CVH in both women and men.\nPsychosocial stressors, including depression, are emerging as risk factors for CVD in young adults 21 and particularly in women. 14,22,23 In addition, they are important to identify because they are potentially modifiable. Several mechanisms have been proposed as a cause of increased CVD associated with psychosocial stress, including activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, 13,24 heightened sympathetic activation, 25 central obesity, 26 increased platelet reactivity, 27 and endothelial dysfunction. 28 Cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, and physical inactivity, have also been linked to self-perceived stress. 29 More importantly, there are physiological sex differences in the way both women perceive stress and the magnitude of the stress response. 30 Women experience both stress at work and strain from family life, and this stress may be stronger predictors of CVD in women. 7,31 Women with coronary heart disease have a more adverse psychological profile than similar men, 14 and a recent study suggested that psychosocial factors might partially explain the increased rates of readmission after myocardial infarction in women. 32 Thus, improving psychosocial well-being might be one mechanism to improve CVD outcomes in these high-risk women. 32 In this context, we had hypothesized that psychological factors would be associated with a worse CVH profile among women compared to men. We found that among women, all 6 psychological factors were associated with being less likely to have adequate or optimal CVH, whereas in men, only stress and depression were associated. However, contrary to our hypothesis, there were generally no significant interactions by sex for the associations of psychological stress with LS7 metrics, although low life satisfaction appeared to be a stronger risk factor in women. It is important to note that this study sample was predominantly women (74%), and the adverse psychological factors were less prevalent in men; therefore, the lack of association of certain psychological factors with LS7 metrics in men may be due to reduced statistical power.\nThe results of our study show that easily measured selfperceived psychological factors in healthy participants, who are predominantly ethnic minorities, are associated with lower attainment of ideal CVH metrics, and this is indicative of future CVD risk. 33 These findings are an opportunity for primary prevention strategies in improving psychological health particularly targeted at healthy employees, women, and ethnic minorities in reducing the growing burden of CVD both in the United States and globally. Psychological interventions, such as meditation, may help reduce cardiovascular risk as an adjunct to established medical and lifestyle preventive therapies, 34 but further research is needed.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "Our study has many strengths, including a large sample of ethnically diverse individuals (largely Hispanic/Latino) and notably a large number of women. However, our findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, as mentioned previously, the questionnaire used was not a validated tool for the assessment of psychological stress. These survey questions assessed a participant's own perception of the presence of depression, anxiety, and so on, but did not yield diagnostic data for the presence of a psychological condition as would be defined by formal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Of note, the prevalence of psychological factors reported was lower than in the general population. 35 Prior studies have found self-reported depression to be only moderately correlated with clinical depression, 36 and underreporting based on age, sex, and severity of symptom could have resulted in underestimation of our association. Furthermore, this was an occupational-based health survey and employees might not wish to disclose to their employer about psychosocial factors due to concern about stigma, which could also contribute to underestimation of true prevalence. Second, other self-reported covariates, including diet and physical activity, ascertained by survey may have been subject to recall bias. However, other cohorts have found that simple short questionnaires to assess physical activity are reasonably valid epidemiologic tools, particularly when used by healthcare professionals. 37 Third, this survey was conducted among healthcare employees who may be more health conscious than the general population; indeed, the prevalence for CVD risk factors such as smoking was low in this population. While the results may not be generalizable to other populations, however, we do feel that the associations are still valid on an individual basis. Fourth, multiple testing was done and statistically significant findings may have been seen by chance, but results were generally consistent across our various definitions of ideal CVH and were generally consistent between men and women. Fifth, we adjusted for demographic characteristics but there may be potential unmeasured confounders that we did not account for. Finally, given the cross-sectional nature of this study, even though we found an association between several psychological risk factors and adverse cardiovascular profile, we were not able to make inferences about temporality or causation. Exploring these questions in a longitudinal study may better clarify temporality.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results showed that in an ethnically diverse population of healthcare employees, individuals with negative selfperceived psychological factors have a lower prevalence of ideal CVH as measured by the LS7 criteria.

Although this research is important in helping to reduce or eliminate LUTS conditions, it has done little to prevent the onset of LUTS. With the aging of the population and rising costs of healthcare, focusing on treatment, as opposed to prevention, may be unsustainable. The Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) research consortium was developed with a novel goal to develop a prevention research agenda through a transdisciplinary scientific initiative.\nThe consortium recognized that bladder health is a construct-an attribute that can be defined and measured in terms of separate, but related subcomponents. 1 This approach can be divided into three considerations. First, the construct of bladder health is composed of multiple health promoting functions that reflect more than the absence of LUTS. Second, bladder health is influenced by risk and protective factors across different levels of biology, psychology, and social ecology (interpersonal, institutional, community, and societal). 2 Third, bladder health can only be understood and promoted through the study of diverse populations of girls and women across all stages of life.\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) introduced the concept of prevention as an important priority for women's urologic research as a prelude to supporting the formation of a prevention-oriented research consortium to complement the ongoing efforts within the NIDDK aimed at improving the understanding of patients with LUTS through deep phenotyping: the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) and the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP). A request for applications was published in August 2014, and PLUS was funded and initiated in 2015. This research group is composed of seven research centers and one Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to advance the consortium's work (Fig. 1). The Research Centers were selected based on their potential to change current paradigms that hinder development of bladder health promotion efforts with potential for implementation at the population level. The SDCC was selected based on its capacity to support biopsychosocial and social ecological approaches toward bladder health and urinary symptom prevention research.\nThe purpose of this article is to introduce PLUS to the scientific community, describe its unique research mission to identify factors that promote female bladder health across the life course and prevent the onset of LUTS, and to share the innovative paradigms by which the consortium operates.

LUTS include various dysfunctions of the bladder, pelvic floor, and/or specific pathology (i.e., bladder infections). 3,4 The International Continence Society (ICS) standardized nomenclature divides LUTS into three groups: storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms. 3 Storage symptoms are experienced as urine accumulates in the bladder and include symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and incontinence. Voiding symptoms are experienced during the emptying phase and include symptoms such as abnormalities in voided stream (e.g., hesitancy) and postmicturition symptoms such as postvoid dribbling and the feeling of incomplete emptying. 3,4 PLUS uses the ICS definitions of LUTS to be inclusive of all symptoms, including pain, associated with lower urinary tract conditions in women. 4 LUTS are highly prevalent in women. The individual and societal burden from LUTS is expected to increase as the female population ages. 5,6 Based on population growth and estimated prevalence, LUTS may affect more than 43 million women in the United States over the next 30 years. 7 In community samples, 73% of women reported at least one storage or voiding symptom, while moderate-severe LUTS were reported by 18% of women 30 years of age and older. 8 A recent cross-sectional Norwegian study of urinary incontinence (UI) showed that 11.3% of women in their 20's experienced LUTS and these symptoms increased with each decade, with *30% of women in their 50's and 40% of women in their 80's experiencing LUTS. 9 The National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005 to 2010 showed that 17% of women \u202120 years had experienced UI, 10 with symptoms worsening with age to the extent that nearly 20% of women over 50 years of age reported moderate-to-severe UI. 11 Other LUTS evident in women include those associated with interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome reported in 3% and bladder infections, which affect women across the life course, but particularly women over 45 years of age. 12,13 The economic impact of LUTS in women and girls is profound. While the overall costs to society has not been determined, the financial cost in the United States of overactive bladder (i.e., urgency, with or without urinary frequency, nocturia, or urgency UI) alone in 2007 in both sexes was determined to be $65.9 billion per year and projected to be $82.6 billion per year in 2020. 14 Recurrent bladder infections generate approximately $2 billion annually in U.S. healthcare costs as a result of outpatient visits, diagnostic tests, and prescriptions. 15,16 Clearly, LUTS result in considerable individual and societal costs that will increase significantly as the population ages. Indeed, many women, even severely symptomatic women, often delay or do not seek treatment, which could result in loss of productivity and added costs to treatment should symptoms progress. Reasons to delay or not seek care include lack of knowledge about the risks for LUTS, misconceptions about normal aging, and misperceptions about treatment availability and efficacy. 17 It has long been recognized that LUTS can have serious negative impacts on quality of life. Furthermore, LUTS significantly contribute to overall morbidity and are strongly associated with many chronic medical conditions. Depression, decreased physical activity, obesity, weight gain, and diabetes have all been linked to LUTS and many are likely bidirectional associations. 18,19 In one study, when women were matched for age, race, and comorbidity index, the presence of LUTS independently predicted increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and medical provider visits, as well as decreased work productivity and increased activity impairment. 20 These compelling associations highlight the urgent need to develop evidence-based prevention strategies for LUTS and their downstream consequences. By reducing rates of LUTS onset in girls and women, the burden in terms of healthcare costs and decreased quality of life may also be reduced.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The PLUS Research Paradigm", "text": "Bladder health promotion and LUTS prevention require an expansion beyond the traditional research paradigm of focusing on disease treatment to developing the evidence base that will lead to recommendations that promote bladder health and inform prevention of LUTS in girls and women.

While multidisciplinary approaches utilize experts from different disciplines, the contributions from these experts are used without integration. Interdisciplinary research on the other hand integrates experts across different disciplines and conducts its work jointly. Transdisciplinary research integrates discipline-specific approaches and extends to generate a fundamentally new aspect to scientific inquiry. 21 Members of the consortium were selected intentionally to bring expertise in preventive medicine, primary care, nursing, medical sociology, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and biostatistics, along with adolescent medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (urology and urogynecology). To achieve the consortium goals, it was necessary to adopt a transdisciplinary approach that would take full advantage of this breadth of expertise among consortium investigators. Early rapid consensus affirmed our intention to avoid traditional hierarchies; instead the consortium investigators embraced, harnessed, and stimulated the transdisciplinary approach among themselves. During the formative phase of PLUS, senior leadership provided intentional efforts for investigators to learn about each other to learn from each other during subsequent PLUS activities. To facilitate this process, we established a series of web-based educational seminars for all PLUS investigators to promote transdisciplinary thinking, particularly as it relates to our goals of defining bladder health and its potential risk and protective factors. several factors that potentially affect LUTS development and progression; and these gaps may have hindered the development of an effective LUTS prevention strategy. For example, there is little evidence about individual behaviors or habits that contribute to LUTS or that promote healthy bladder function, and there are large gaps in our understanding of risk and protective factors for symptom progression. Moreover, most established risk factors have only been studied at the level of the individual (e.g., individual conditions such as obesity, behaviors such as caffeine consumption, characteristics such as age), whereas very little is understood regarding the myriad of risk and protective factors operating at other levels of social ecology (e.g., social and environmental factors). 2,22 PLUS is committed to developing and broadening this evidence base and encouraging the LUTS research community to look beyond a diseasefocused perspective to be inclusive of health promotion and prevention that will ultimately lead to a reduction in incidence and prevalence.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Developing a definition of bladder health", "text": "PLUS identified an urgent need at the outset to define the construct of ''bladder health'' and develop measures to assess bladder health and various degrees of LUTS across the entire life course. As bladder health has never been rigorously defined nor systematically studied, several of the consortium's preliminary studies will focus on understanding and defining bladder health with the goal of developing tools to measure the bladder health construct. To this end, the consortium worked to develop a preliminary framework for conceptualizing bladder health at different life stages. Three broad aspects of bladder function were adopted as follows: storage, emptying, and bioregulatory. The novel bioregulatory function component encompasses the role of the bladder in preventing systemic disease (e.g., infection and malignancy). The consortium identified knowledge gaps related to ''normal'' or healthy states after proposing both subjective and objective measures for each of the bladder functions. The details of this process will be forthcoming. In addition to defining bladder health, a fundamental aspect of promoting LUTS prevention is to understand how women view their own bladder and pelvic floor function. PLUS is developing qualitative research protocols to examine girl's and women's knowledge, behaviors, and perceptions related to bladder health and LUTS.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Broadening the view: a shift from individual-based biological focus to broader social ecology", "text": "Currently, the majority of female LUTS-related research has centered on biological risk factors and medical interventions and has largely focused on the segment of the population with current symptoms of LUTS or the so-called ''tip of the iceberg.'' These efforts are likely influenced by the ease in defining and describing the array of bladder disorders while the bladder is in a state of illness and the difficulty in defining bladder health and best practices for bladder health. The current scientific evidence about bladder health is largely confined to the bladder's ability to store and empty urine observed in a clinical setting. Unfortunately, the current literature assumes that the absence of symptoms in a particular area of bladder function (e.g., incontinence) equates to bladder health. This assumption is problematic when attempting to assess bladder health or LUTS risk factors, because a ''no'' response to a query about the presence of UI does not infer the absence of other LUTS (e.g., dysuria, difficulty voiding, and so on) nor does it necessarily indicate a state of bladder health.\nUnderstanding bladder health will involve investigating the childhood history and behaviors of girls and women who do and do not have LUTS, including toilet training, daily habits such as voiding behaviors, intake of fluid types and amounts, and lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking, exercise, and so on). Girls and women's attitudes and beliefs about what practices will promote bladder health are likely influenced by all levels of social ecology. 23 Cultural differences in attitudes and behaviors are also important to explore, as differences among ethnic and racial populations have been documented. For example, in certain cultures, women fear being stigmatized based on having an unclean body and a compromised social identity. 24 It has long been recognized in public health that an individual's health and health behaviors are affected by a variety of contextual settings. These contexts include interpersonal relationships, institutional environments, such as schools and workplaces, community-level factors, such as the built environment and cultural norms, and societal levels factors, including industry influences and health policy. As we broaden our research scope beyond individual biology and behavior, we will improve our ability to understand the mechanisms necessary to maintain bladder health within widely varying contextual settings of social ecology.\nThis broadened approach allows us to explore environmental factors that may create a significant burden for girls and women to maintain bladder health. Creating foundational knowledge about the role of environmental factors, particularly those involving toilet access, cleanliness and safety, and personal, social, school and occupational barriers, as well as public policy, are important research goals within PLUS.\nThese environmental based knowledge gaps have been incorporated into the consortium's conceptual framework, which is being used to identify protective and risk factors for bladder health and LUTS across the life course. PLUS adapted a framework based on that of Glass and McAtee, 2 to include social ecological, as well as biological factors, which may influence bladder health across the life course. PLUS investigators are identifying factors for further investigation at each level of our conceptual framework, from societal to the individual. Details will be forthcoming in future publications.\nBroadening the view: life course perspective PLUS is committed to studying ways to prevent LUTS across all life stages. This approach assumes that bladder health can be compromised at any stage in the life course, and bladder pathology manifesting in adulthood may begin early in life. Therefore, the importance of identifying protective and risk factors during the early stages of life is evident. This approach is also consistent with health promotion and prevention for other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. PLUS's initial efforts will focus on identifying factors in individuals that can report information for themselves (adolescents through community-dwelling older women), recognizing that factors amenable to intervention in childhood may emerge.\nAs women develop normally, common day-to-day activities, as well as biological changes, can influence LUTS onset and progression. For example, high impact sports, vigorous activities, and pregnancy are associated with stress incontinence in girls and women during their reproductive years, and the menopausal transition is associated with overactive bladder, urinary tract infections, and UI. 13 Recent research has shown that older women prone to falls and fractures were also more likely to experience urgency UI, 13 and a history of involvement in professional sports had a negative impact on current pelvic floor health. 25 It is important that all research conducted to explore these risk factors, as well as protective factors, assess temporality and bidirectionality of these associations.\nA commitment to involving community stakeholders in prioritizing and building the research initiatives From the inception of the consortium, PLUS investigators prioritized a strong focus on engaging community stakeholders. The consortium embraces best community engagement practices, which include recommending and overseeing mechanisms for reciprocal communication with a variety of community-based individuals located within our priority ecological settings. A standing committee was formed to promote and oversee the community engagement activities associated with the PLUS research initiatives. Furthermore, PLUS investigators intend to disseminate results of our community engagement methods and progress to the scientific community, so that other consortia may utilize best practices and learn from this novel approach to studying health and promoting disease prevention.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Challenges for the Consortium", "text": "The PLUS structure and governance are predicated on flexibility and fluidity, especially as its work evolves.

The PLUS Steering Committee (SC), formed by the Principal Investigators (PIs), NIDDK program scientist, and contracted SC Chair, is the decision-making body of the Consortium. A small Executive Committee is composed of two rotating research center PIs, SDCC PIs, SC Chair, and the NIDDK Scientific Officer.

The consortium's investigators uphold the goal of continual assessment of our efforts to include and value the perspectives of all investigators and the expression of all voices. The pragmatic consequences of structure and governance reflect these principles and values that affirm equal opportunity for participation and representation. Being broadly inclusive of all perspectives and making decisions in a timely manner will remain a work in progress.\nOur structures and processes will continue to evolve as we balance this inherent tension. We work to identify disconnects in our communications as quickly as possible and often find that there is not as much disagreement as there is terminology confusion arising from how different disciplines use the same terms to mean different things. A professional moderator for periodic in-person meetings assists the consortium members to create transparency, build consensus, and ensure clarity of language and shared decision making. The use of online web-based weekly meetings, task management programs, and integrated website technology to maintain up-to-date and open communication are other keys to our success. In addition, the ability to adapt and remodel into different work groups has facilitated the progress of the consortium. Our choice to adopt a transdisciplinary perspective fosters this collaboration and provides the unique opportunity to address LUTS using a paradigm that integrates biology, psychology, and social ecology.

While research has focused on its clinical presentation and treatment, less is known about fibromyalgia's clinical epidemiology in real-world healthcare systems. Gender differences have been difficult to study because relatively few males are diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Methods: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia nationwide in FY 2012 were compared to Veterans with other pain diagnoses on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, health service use, and opioid and psychotropic prescription fills. Additional analyses compared characteristics of men and women diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Risk ratios and Cohen's d were used for bivariate comparisons, followed by logistic regression analyses to identify independent factors associated with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the VHA. Results: Altogether, 77,087 of 2,216,621 Veterans with pain diagnoses (3.48%) were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. They were more likely to be female, younger than patients with other pain conditions, more likely to have multiple psychiatric comorbidities and other types of pain, and used more medical outpatient services. Women diagnosed with fibromyalgia were younger and more likely to have headaches, connective tissue diseases (CTD), and psychiatric comorbidities, while men had more comorbid medical conditions. Conclusions: In this large, predominantly older male sample of Veterans with pain diagnoses, those with fibromyalgia were far more likely to be women. Gender comparisons showed women with fibromyalgia were more likely to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and CTD, while males were more likely to be diagnosed with medical conditions.

Notably, fibromyalgia has a high incidence of psychiatric comorbidity, but no widely accepted etiology. [2][3][4][5] In the United States, the prevalence of fibromyalgia has been estimated to range from 2% to 8%, affecting 5-10 million adults. 6,7 It is most prevalent among middle-aged women, encompassing 75%-90% of those diagnosed. [8][9][10] A diagnosis of fibromyalgia has classically been reliant on an evaluation of ''tender points,'' or areas of tenderness around joints, assessed by palpation or algometer. 11,12 Women tend to report more tender points than men, 13 and have been reported to feel pain more intensely at these sites. 14 The greater frequency of fibromyalgia among women has thus been largely attributed to this criterion. Recently revised diagnostic standards have eliminated the use of tender points as a determining factor, and as a result, gender differences in prevalence appear to be far smaller than previously estimated. 7,15 However, a recent study suggested that despite efforts to develop diagnostic tools for assessing symptoms related to fibromyalgia, these guidelines are not universally applied in clinical settings and lack physiological justification 16 ; thus, there is no ''gold standard'' for a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\nFibromyalgia is commonly associated with psychiatric comorbidities. 7,17 International research has shown high rates of Axis I and II diagnoses, including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with fibromyalgia. [18][19][20][21][22] Furthermore, the underlying physical cause(s) of fibromyalgia remain unknown, although it is potentially associated with dysregulated dopamine in the brain reward circuitry. 23,24 Thus, diagnosis relies exclusively on self-report data. 25 As a result of this diagnostic ambiguity and substantial psychiatric comorbidity, fibromyalgia is frequently, and controversially, viewed as a somatoform psychiatric disorder. 15,26 Whether gender differences in prevalence of fibromyalgia are accompanied by other gender differences has not been systematically examined because of the small male samples in most studies.\nSeveral studies from outside the United States have suggested that people diagnosed with fibromyalgia are significantly more impaired and utilize higher amounts of healthcare resources compared to the general population. Two Canadian studies of women with fibromyalgia found this cohort to be high consumers of conventional, as well as complementary and alternative medicine. 27,28 Furthermore, it has been reported that each comorbid condition accompanying fibromyalgia is associated with a 20% increase in healthcare costs, 28 with psychological vulnerability further increasing levels of service use and cost. 27 In United Kingdom, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was related to higher rates of illness and healthcare resource use for at least 10 years before diagnosis. 29 Nearly 47% of a Scottish sample reported having lost their job due to impairment related to fibromyalgia, although further analyses revealed no difference in health service utilization between these patients and a clinic control group. 30 Despite the host of international studies, few studies have evaluated the prevalence and correlates of fibromyalgia in large U.S. clinical populations. Sanchez et al. evaluated healthcare resource use based on claim data from Humana Inc. using ICD-9 codes representing fibromyalgia. 31 In the 6 months following a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, patients showed significantly increased rates of service utilization and use of pain-related medication compared to prediagnosis levels, although this rate returned to the baseline level within 3 years. 31 In a multisite study of rheumatology clinics, Wolfe et al. 32 reported increased healthcare utilization and cost associated with fibromyalgia severity and related functional disability. Patients with fibromyalgia were also more likely to undergo various surgeries, and hospitalizations. 32 A recent study examined gender differences in the demographics and clinical correlates of musculoskeletal disorders among Veterans. In that study, fibromyalgia was included among 14 groups of musculoskeletal disorders and was not examined separately. 33 Thus, no study, to our knowledge, has systematically compared sociodemographic characteristics, patterns of comorbidity, service use, and psychotropic medication prescription fills among patients with fibromyalgia in comparison to patients with other pain syndrome diagnoses, or between males and females diagnosed with fibromyalgia. In a previous study, however, we reported a high rate of fibromyalgia in a national sample of patients served by specialized pain clinics in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in FY 2012. 34 In this study, we sought to expand on this finding by comparing sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and service use among Veterans diagnosed with fibromyalgia compared to Veterans with other pain diagnoses. Furthermore, taking advantage of the large proportion of men in the VHA, we further examined differences between men and women diagnosed with fibromyalgia on sociodemographic characteristics, concomitant diagnoses, and service use, including psychotropic and opiate prescription fills.

While VHA datasets can be informative in terms of detailing the prevalence and correlates of a given diagnosis, it is important to note that this dataset reflects real-world practice by front-line clinicians in the VHA, and thus reflects how the VHA operates, including clinician biases in terms of diagnostic and treatment patterns.\nThis study compared Veterans receiving a diagnosis of fibromyalgia to those with other pain diagnoses nationally in the VHA in FY 2012. The 3.48% diagnosed with fibromyalgia were robustly more likely to be female, and younger than patients with other pain conditions. Taking advantage of the large proportion of men in VHA, we found that among those diagnosed with fibromyalgia, women were younger than their male counterparts. They also tended to have other pain-related conditions, including headaches and CTD. Finally, it is notable that these women also had higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity, while men had more comorbid medical conditions.\nThe major finding of the first set of analyses was the substantial gender disparity associated with a fibromyalgia diagnosis, with a female:male ratio of 4:1. This finding is consistent with an extensive literature reporting a substantially higher prevalence of fibromyalgia among women, with male:female ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:9. 5,7,8 Generally, women are at greater risk for developing chronic pain, purportedly due to a number of factors ranging from gender expectations to hormonal influences. 38 The major theory that has historically explained the gender disparity specific to fibromyalgia has been the reliance on tender points for diagnosis. However, tender points are difficult to assess, and women have many such points when compared to men, biasing an alreadydisparate pain syndrome. More recent studies reflecting the 2010 removal of tender points as a diagnostic criterion for fibromyalgia have reported gender ratios approaching equality. 39 However, we do not have data on how and if the tender points criteria were applied by VA clinicians, although literature suggests that clinicians in general may have not been particularly vigilant in assessing this criterion, suggesting that it may not be of clinical importance in real-world practice. 16 A second notable finding of this study is that Veterans with fibromyalgia were, on average, 4 years younger than their counterparts diagnosed with other pain conditions. The relationship between age and the likelihood of a fibromyalgia diagnosis has been a subject of debate. While it is commonly thought that fibromyalgia tends to appear in younger cohorts, 40 studies of the general population indicate that fibromyalgia can appear at any age, ranging from childhood to late adulthood, with risk increasing with age. 39,41,42 Overall, our findings regarding age are consistent with the literature showing a prevalence of fibromyalgia in later middle age. [42][43][44] The most distinctive feature of this study is the exploration of gender differences in patterns of multimorbidity. Mutimorbidity has been the focus of increasing attention in recent years because it has been noted that, while most randomized trials exclude co-morbid conditions, most patients, in fact, have multiple diagnoses. [45][46][47] Notably, women with fibromyalgia lacked major medical diagnoses that could elucidate complaints of diffuse pain, with the exception of CTD and headache pain. As fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose itself, it is notable that women Veterans with fibromyalgia had a higher prevalence of both psychiatric diagnoses as well as CTD. Coinciding with the challenges associated with making a diagnosis fibromyalgia, CTD is also difficult to diagnose and is characterized by unspecified defects and in-flammation of collagen and other connective tissue structures, as well as by pain, related to autoimmune disease processes. 48 Although fibromyalgia is likely not autoimmune in nature, some symptoms closely resemble autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid conditions are often accompanied by fibromyalgia, which may be added as a diagnostic label for the resultant diffuse pain. 49 In contrast to women, men with fibromyalgia were more likely to have several general medical conditions, including myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and diabetic complications, including pain. It could be speculated that the greater age of men might explain this discrepancy, and while this was partially true, these differences persisted after adjustment for age in multiple logistic regression.\nIt is also notable that concomitant psychiatric disorders were more common among women compared to men. The higher prevalence of bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and particularly major depression among women Veterans is consistent with the diagnostic pattern found among women with fibromyalgia in the general population, 50,51 and these findings largely persisted in multiple logistic regression analyses. These findings are consistent with previous studies that reported more frequent psychiatric conditions in female Veterans with chronic pain 52 or, more specifically, with musculoskeletal pain. 33 Despite the higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity, women were no more likely than men to seek mental health treatment. However, Veterans with fibromyalgia do appear more likely to utilize medical-surgical services. Primary care providers may attempt to treat the comorbid pain and psychiatric conditions in women, rather than referring patients with fibromyalgia to mental health services, or these patients may be more likely to refuse mental health services. It is also possible that women are reluctant to accept that a psychiatric diagnosis may be complicating their pain, and are thus less likely to seek multidisciplinary pain treatment.\nA final, particularly encouraging finding of this study is that, although opioids are often used to manage fibromyalgia pain in the general population, our data do not suggest extensive use of these potentially addictive drugs for Veterans with fibromyalgia. Longitudinal data from a multidisciplinary pain clinic indicated that patients receiving opioids for fibromyalgia have poorer outcomes, including more debilitating symptoms and reduced functionality. 53 A particular strength of this study is the large sample, including high numbers of men, and one that reflects real-world clinician practice in a national healthcare system. It should be noted that a feature of large, administrative datasets such as this is that they reflect real-world practice by front-line clinicians. While this dataset may reflect clinician bias, it is important to understand provider behavior and how diagnoses are applied in the VHA. This study is the first to our knowledge, to examine gender differences in both the prevalence of fibromyalgia and in patterns of multimorbidity in the VHA, and suggests that clinician practice in the VHA, as it relates to fibromyalgia, mimics that of physicians in the general population.\nA limitation of this study is that, although this sample reflects data from FY 2012, it is likely that the sample included patients with a long-standing fibromyalgia diagnosis dating back to before the criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia were changed to exclude ''tender points.'' However, the new criteria do not indicate a lower incidence of fibromyalgia in women, but a higher incidence in men. As such, it is possible that our sample actually underestimates the incidence of fibromyalgia in male Veterans. A future study comparing the diagnostic rates and correlates of fibromyalgia in a more recent sample, taking tender points into consideration, would be informative. A second limitation is that data on the procedures VA clinicians used to diagnose fibromyalgia, as well as psychiatric diagnoses, in this sample were not available, and diagnosis is reliant exclusively on coding within each patient's medical record. Thus, it is unknown if evaluation of tender points was incorporated into their assessment of fibromyalgia, and what other factors resulted in this diagnosis. However, it seems likely that a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in real-world practice relies more heavily on factors other than tender points, including self-reported pain, functionality, and quality of life. 16 Furthermore, it is also important to note that psychiatric diagnoses are not necessarily systematic in the VA, and are thus reliant on individual patient-physician factors. Finally, as this analysis was performed using national VA data, which is representative of an older, male, more disabled population, the generalizability of these findings to the general population is unknown.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "These results from a national VHA sample of Veterans comprised predominately of men, showed both that women were more likely to have fibromyalgia than men, and men and women exhibit substantially different patterns of multimorbidity.

[11][12][13][14][15] As a result, several national organizations, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Cancer Society (ACS), and Society of Breast Imaging (SBI)/ American College of Radiology (ACR), support supplemental breast MRI screening in women at high (>20%) lifetime risk. [16][17][18] High-risk screening represents the second most common clinical indication for breast MRI use after presurgical extent of disease workup for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, and accounts for nearly one-third of breast MRI examinations performed. 19 Although national organization recommendations have helped to facilitate a 20-fold increase in screening breast MRI use over the past two decades, the few reports regarding utilization rates suggest that only a small proportion of high-risk women actually obtain supplemental breast MRI screening. 20 Reasons for underutilization of supplemental breast MRI among high-risk patients are currently uncertain, and the availability of on-site breast MRI has been suggested as a potential determinant for screening MRI access and utilization. 21 Imaging facilities offering on-site breast MRI may mitigate potential barriers to utilization, including increased time constraints and financial costs resulting from women having to identify additional facilities for services beyond mammography. It remains unclear, however, whether women at high lifetime breast cancer risk already attend facilities offering on-site screening MRI and how patient characteristics influence on-site breast MRI use. Thus, our study objectives were to determine the availability of on-site supplemental MRI screening among U.S. women at high risk, who undergo routine mammography, and evaluate clinical and sociodemographic characteristics associated with on-site MRI use.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study setting and population", "text": "We conducted a cross-sectional study of all women who obtained a screening mammogram in 2012 at imaging facilities included in the National Cancer Institute-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), the largest data resource on breast cancer screening in the United States composed of a network of regional registries.

Only 6.6% of patients at high lifetime risk underwent screening breast MRI in our study. Our results corroborate suggestions of screening MRI underuse reported in previous studies, even when considering on-site MRI availability.\nPreviously, Wernli et al. demonstrated low screening breast MRI use among an earlier cohort (2005-2009) of patients with high lifetime risk in community practice. 19 Similarly, Miller found that breast MRI uptake was <5% based on self-reported data in a nationally representative sample of women, despite including breast MRI examinations performed for all clinical indications. 20 In the context of these prior analyses, our findings suggest that on-site availability at screening facilities likely does not alleviate screening MRI underuse.\nDifferential on-site MRI screening use was seen in certain subgroups of high-risk women. Characteristics associated with MRI use among women with high lifetime risk included younger age (<40 years), prior breast biopsy, postsecondary education, and shorter (<30 minutes) travel time to facility. In multivariate analysis, strong family history was also associated with on-site MRI use among women at high lifetime risk.\nGreater worry about breast cancer risk seen in younger populations and longer remaining life expectancy may act as drivers for increased utilization among younger women compared to women older than 40 years. 23 In addition, Brinton demonstrated that radiologists were more likely to recommend supplemental MRI screening in patients younger than 40 years compared to older patients, potentially triggering providers to order breast MRI at increased rates for younger women. 24 An increased utilization in patients with prior breast biopsy may reflect an increased exposure to advanced breast imaging services and heightened awareness of breast cancer risk.\nOur study builds on findings by Haas et al., 25 who reported a positive association between advanced education and uptake of supplemental MRI screening services over time. Higher educational attainment may increase personal perception of risk based on family history, which may encourage women in this group to discuss risk reduction with healthcare providers. 25 Prior studies have also suggested disparities among traditionally underserved groups in gaining access to genetic risk assessment, which may directly impact referral for supplemental breast screening. 26 We found no significant difference in on-site MRI use between women who resided in areas with low household income levels compared to women with higher income levels. Additional reported barriers to supplemental screening include lack of a primary care provider, lack of health insurance, associated out-of-pocket costs, anxiety related to MRI exams, and lack of social support, although these factors were not assessed in our study. 27 Multispecialty breast centers and full diagnostic radiology practices represented the most common practice types to offer breast MRI screening, reflecting their propensity for early adoption of advanced imaging modalities for new indications such as screening. 26 Most facilities offering supplemental MRI screening were also located in urban settings. This, in addition to low availability of on-site MRI screening services for patients living >30 minutes from their screening facility, supports previously described geographic access barriers to breast MRI among rural patients. [28][29][30][31][32] Prior studies have suggested that increasing physician time constraints and lack of provider familiarity with genetic risk assessment tools, both contribute to barriers for improved breast cancer screening and risk reduction measures. [33][34][35] Misperception of breast cancer risk by both physicians and patients may also partially explain overall low utilization. Provider overreliance on family history in recommending advanced imaging was suggested by Wernli et al., who showed that only 25% of patients undergoing high-risk MRI screening met ACS criteria. 19 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a majority of high-risk women underestimate their risk, while average-risk women overestimate their risk, potentially influencing patient pursuit of supplemental screening. 36 Our study had several strengths, including the analysis of a large, diverse patient population associated with a geographically diverse set of imaging facilities. Compared to Haas, who looked at overall breast MRI utilization patterns over time, we provide an updated analysis using an expanded number of facilities aimed at determining the effect of on-site screening breast MRI availability on breast MRI screening utilization rates among high-risk women. Our study also had several limitations. We did not have data from non-BCSC facilities that may have provided supplemental screening services for facilities without on-site breast MRI availability. It is difficult to ascertain whether additional women would have been classified as high risk based on more comprehensive risk models, specifically those named in the ACS guidelines, including BRCAPRO, Boadicea, and Tyrer-Cuzick risk models. Information collected at the time of imaging was insufficient for calculating risk assessment using these newer models. Despite this limitation, the Gail model is the oldest and most widely available tool for breast cancer risk assessment; therefore, use of this model may more closely reflect current practice for risk-based MRI screening.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we observed that nearly one-third of U.S. community-based screening facilities included in our study have on-site breast MRI capability and nearly one-half of the high-risk women attended a facility offering on-site screening breast MRI. However, despite its widespread availability, use of supplemental screening breast MRI remains low among women classified as having high lifetime risk. A better understanding of the sociodemographic determinants of breast MRI underuse is needed to guide novel interventions that target high-risk women who may benefit from supplemental screening. Future studies should aim to identify and evaluate novel interventions for increasing use of screening MRI among high-risk women, such as automated lifetime risk calculations included in screening mammography reports. 37 Newer technologies such as abbreviated/fast breast MRI should be examined as lower cost, higher value options that may encourage more high-risk women to undergo supplemental MRI screening. Special attention and heightened awareness in women demonstrating low socioeconomic factors and older age may also be needed to ensure that all women benefit from supplemental screening services.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the participating women, facilities, and radiologists for the data they have provided.

Methods: We evaluated a 4-month pilot (March 2016-June 2016) to screen pregnant women (at *14-23 weeks of gestation) for ACEs and resiliency in two Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical centers (N = 480). We examined the acceptability of the screening to patients through telephone surveys (N = 210) and to clinicians through surveys and focus groups (N = 26). Results: Most eligible patients (78%) were screened. Patients who received the screening were significantly more likely to be non-Hispanic White, Asian, or of ''Other'' or ''Unknown'' race/ethnicity than African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity ( p = 0.02).

As frequent visits are part of routine prenatal care, obstetricians are ideally positioned to break the transgenerational cycle of ACEs 9 by letting patients know that ACEs can significantly affect their health, conveying that they are not alone, and connecting them with helpful resources. 10 However, few clinicians screen patients for ACEs, 11 and data are needed to evaluate the perceived benefits and harms of ACEs screening among pregnant women and clinicians and the factors that facilitate or impede ACEs screening in prenatal care.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability (to patients and clinicians) of adopting screening for ACEs as part of standard prenatal care, in two medical centers at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC).\nMethods KPNC is a nonprofit, integrated healthcare delivery system providing comprehensive health services to over 4 million members, and covering >40% of the region's commercially insured population. 12 KPNC has >500 obstetric physicians and nurse practitioners and >100 certified nurse-midwives. Medical assistants support clinicians for office clinical care. Over 40,000 pregnancies occur annually across 15 medical centers. Patients are racially and socioeconomically diverse and representative of the northern California population. 13 From March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, a pilot program to screen women for ACEs and resilience as part of standard prenatal care was implemented in two KPNC medical centers. Physicians (N = 18), nurse practitioners (N = 3), and certified nurse midwives (N = 5) at both sites received 2 hour-long trainings in preparation for the screening implementation. The trainings had four components: (1) education about ACEs and resilience and their associations with health outcomes;\n(2) education on providing patients with trauma-informed care;\n(3) review of the patient resource handout; and (4) information on workflow changes and protocols for reviewing the questionnaires and connecting patients with resources. Medical assistants received a 1-hour training that included education about ACEs and resilience and an overview of workflow changes.\nAll English-speaking patients aged \u202118 who completed a second or third prenatal visit between 16 and 23 weeks of gestation at the two site's clinics during the study period were eligible (N = 480). Each site selected the prenatal visit that worked best with their workflow (Site A, 19-23 weeks; Site B, 14-19 weeks).\nPatients were identified by the medical assistant (Site A) or department manager (Site B) during prenatal visit registration (Site A) or patient rooming (Site B). Patients received an introductory letter and the questionnaires, which they completed in the exam room. The clinician reviewed the questionnaires with patients and gave them a site-specific two-page resource list that included both KPNC and external resources, including support groups, parenting classes, and health education. Referral to behavioral health and psychiatry was also an option. Completed questionnaires were stored in locked cabinets and the data were entered on site. This study was approved by the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute Institutional Review Board.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study measures", "text": "An introductory letter was modified from Community Care of North Carolina. 14 Eight ACE exposures before age 18 were assessed using modified questions from the 11-item Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Questionnaire, 15 shortened for easier self-administration in a clinic, to be appropriate for prenatal patients, and to be consistent with an ACEs measure that was developed for a regional KPNC questionnaire. Response options were yes or no; possible ACE scores ranged from 0 to 8, and were categorized (0, 1-2, \u20213) (Appendix 1).\nBecause the negative effects of ACEs can be mitigated by protective factors in adulthood that strengthen coping skills, 16 ACE screening assessed patients' current resilience. The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC 10) measured resilience. It is a widely used validated measure of past-month resilience (e.g., ability to adapt to change, bounce back after hardship, handle unpleasant or painful feelings), used in previous studies of prenatal patients. 17 Items are scored from 0 to 4 and total scores range from 0 to 40. 18,19 Women who completed the ACEs screening received invitation letters in the mail explaining the project with a tollfree number to contact project staff to decline participation. Trained interviewers called patients *2 weeks later, obtained verbal consent, and completed the 7-10 minute interview. Interviews occurred between April and August 2016; patients were not compensated for their time.\nAt the start of the 2-hour clinician training, clinicians received an eight-item survey to evaluate their knowledge of ACEs and to assess their attitudes and perceived barriers toward ACEs screening. The survey was given again at the conclusion of the pilot, at the start of the clinician focus groups (see paragraph below). Answers were on a Likert scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).\nAt the pilot's conclusion, the study's first and senior authors consented participants and led 1-hour semi-structured focus groups at each site. They examined factors that facilitated or impeded screening implementation, assessed clinician willingness to continue screening patients for ACEs, and explored the resource issues and organizational capacity for maintaining the intervention. Participation was optional and clinicians were not compensated.

Several alluded to the lack of training in trauma-informed care and ACEs in medical school, and emphasized the importance of the pilot project's education about the potential lifelong consequences of ACEs and their relevance to prenatal health, variation in susceptibility to adversity, and training in how to sensitively talk to patients about ACEs.\n''Most of the time (the) screen is negative and it's really easy. But when you find that person, you're so glad you did.'' ''I just felt more attentive. In the past, I would have been like, 'Okay, that's just another fact.' But now it was like, 'No. in addition to all your other high risks, this is another high risk for you for the future of parenting.' I felt much more motivated to help her get to the parenting class.''\n(2) Resilience screening: Clinicians appreciated the pairing of the ACE screening with the resilience screening. Many used the resilience screening to get a better sense of how the patient was currently coping and to frame the ACEs conversation. Some wanted additional guidance about how to respond to different combinations of low and high ACE and resilience scores.\n''I think it would have been very difficult to have ACEs without the resiliency score, because then you wouldn't have known what their coping mechanisms and coping ability would be and then the resource to tie into it. It just sort of closed the loop.'' ''I'm thinking, too.we can't change the trauma -the trauma is done. But the resilience piece .the coping piece is the piece that we can work on.''\n(3) Workflow: Clinicians identified that training for and implementation of a standardized office workflow are critical for the successful prenatal office ACEs screening. Many felt that an automated system for flagging patients, and processes for collecting and recording ACE data electronically would improve the workflow. Further, buy in from medical assistants and an enthusiastic clinician champion were identified as important factors that contributed to the success of ACEs screening implementation. There was agreement that screening for ACEs later in pregnancy allowed for greater rapport and trust.\n''.You had more of a rapport with patients ..Doing it [ACEs screening] a little bit later in pregnancy .-there's more of a trust going on.'' (4) Resources: Clinician support for ACEs screening was contingent on having the resource handout and strong linkages with behavioral health and psychiatry. An onsite social worker was identified as an important desired resource to help with counseling, triage, and referral to community resources for social needs and parenting skills. Obstetrician to behavioral health clinician consultation was available, but some voiced lack of confidence that patients would follow through and concerns about whether there were adequate mental health resources. Clinicians agreed that the screening should not be rolled out in other medical offices until they were confident that resources or identified referrals were securely in place.\n''. there's a big gap from handing out a piece of paper, and really receiving useful care.'' ''.I think it would have been difficult to do without the resource sheet.Having that resource sheet, I think, was really vital to be able to say, 'You know, these are the things that can help you.' And I always encouraged everyone to keep the sheet in case issues or things came up in the future.''", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of screening for ACEs as part of standard prenatal care. Clinician screening rates were high (78%) and tools that automatically flag patients for ACEs screening would enhance screening rates further. Nearly 90% of patients completed the screening, and for many expectant mothers, this was their first opportunity to discuss their exposure to ACEs with a healthcare provider. Notably, sharing information about ACEs with a healthcare provider was acceptable and comfortable for most   patients, and in some cases, it strengthened the patient-provider relationship by fostering trust or feelings of closeness. Not surprisingly, patients with zero ACEs reported somewhat higher comfort in completing the questionnaire and discussing ACEs with a healthcare provider. Several patients reiterated the need for clinicians to pay attention, show empathy and caring and respect for privacy, and connect patients with useful resources. The majority agreed that clinicians taking care of prenatal patients should ask about ACEs. These findings are consistent with prior findings in primary care research suggesting that patients value being asked about their trauma history and view their clinicians as capable of helping them with problems associated with ACEs. [20][21][22][23] Despite the overall positive findings, there were several important nuances to the results that need further investigation. First, screening rates were lowest among African American and Hispanic patients and additional research is needed to understand this gap in care. Second, women with race/ethnicity ''Other'' or ''Unknown'' were significantly less likely to complete the screening questionnaire. This may be a reflection of a greater cultural gap between patients and providers, greater perceived stigma, or lower levels of engagement among those ethnic minority patients with the healthcare system. It is also possible that women who chose not to share their race/ethnicity are more private and less likely to disclose personal information in general.\nFinally, while 52% and 54% of women with 0 or 1-2 ACEs, respectively, reported being ''very satisfied'' with the efforts of KPNC clinicians and staff in responding to this issue, the corresponding rate for women with 3+ ACEs was 38%. This indicates that more work is needed to meet the often complex and multifaceted needs of women with higher exposure to ACEs.\nThe successful implementation of ACEs screening requires clinician and staff education about the health consequences of ACEs and training in how to sensitively ask about and respond to patient disclosure of ACEs. While integrating ACEs screening into prenatal care was somewhat uncomfortable for clinicians initially, they reported gains in knowledge of the impact of ACEs on health and improved ability and comfort addressing ACEs after the training and pilot implementation. Many felt that it was easier to do than they anticipated and they valued the opportunity to help mitigate the negative impact of ACEs by connecting women with extra resources to better manage pregnancy and parenthood.\nClinicians felt that including an assessment of patients' current resilience contributed to more tailored discussions and provided the opportunity to reinforce the idea that while ACEs are risk factors, they do not absolutely determine an outcome for an individual, and that healing and recovery are always possible. It is important to note, however, that patients with \u20213 ACEs were less likely to report that their clinician reviewed the ACEs questionnaire with them, and less likely to report that a healthcare provider had asked them about ACEs in the past than those with 1-2 ACEs.\nIt may be that women with high ACEs have substantially different experiences with the healthcare system and there may be both patient and clinician factors that contribute to differences in care received. For example, patients with higher ACEs might avoid sensitive topics that lead clinicians to ask ACEs questions or they may have a greater number of competing medical demands that take up time in medical appointments. Conversely, clinicians may ''profile'' women whom they perceive to be at higher risk of ACEs and avoid screening these patients due to their own discomfort, concerns that patients will get upset, or concerns that the healthcare system doesn't have the capacity to adequately address the behavioral health needs of identified women. This is an important area for future investigation.\nClinicians identified that a standardized workflow is critical to the successful adoption and implementation of ACEs screening in prenatal care. As much as possible, ACEs screening and documentation protocols need to be integrated into existing workflows and the electronic health record. For example, tools that automatically flag patients for ACEs screening and allow for easy documentation of ACEs scores, would make screening more universal and intervention easier in clinical care. The pros and cons of adding patients' ACE scores to the electronic health record, however, need to be carefully considered.\nFinally, clinicians' willingness to screen for ACEs was contingent on having available referral resources and linkages with behavioral medicine, psychiatry, and social work. As with other complex health concerns, primary care providers and patients benefit from referral resources that offer additional help and expertise.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "This pilot study had several limitations. It was conducted at two KPNC medical centers among English-speaking female prenatal adults and results may not be generalizable to other healthcare systems or the U.S. population. ACEs self-reported responses are subject to recall bias. However, retrospective reports of ACEs have shown good test-retest reliability in previous studies. 24 Our shortened assessment of ACEs did not include details on ACEs severity, timing, frequency or duration, or questions on neglect, and thus the prevalence of ACEs is somewhat lower in our sample than previously reported in the literature. 25 Further, our ACEs measure included the term ''sexual abuse'' and future studies should instead use descriptive questions that avoid emotion-laden words, such as abuse. Additional studies with validated expanded questionnaires that include neglect as well as additional adversities (e.g., living in foster care, bullying) 26 are needed.\nWomen not completing the ACEs questionnaire (12%) were not contacted for a phone interview, which may have affected phone survey results. Those who could not be reached (29%) or declined to participate (12%) in the telephone interviews may have had different experiences with the ACEs screening than those who participated, and results could be subject to respondent bias; however, respondents and nonrespondents did not differ significantly on ACE scores or demographic characteristics.

Clinician follow-up for patients happens best when clinicians have a clear algorithm for what to do, that is updated frequently, and of which clinicians are reminded often.

Most of us have some memories of our early life that are positive (such as people who cared about us, people who made us feel confident). There are also childhood experiences that are harmful to children and can continue to affect us as adults. In providing your maternity care, it is helpful for us to know specifically what you experienced while growing up. It helps us to better think about how to support you during your pregnancy and early years of parenting. For example, if you were sexually abused as a child, you may have unique concerns or fears about breastfeeding. If you grew up in a household where you did not have enough to eat, it may be harder for you to know how much your child should eat at any given age.\nIt is also important to know that childhood experiences are only part of a person's story.

Because there are no signs or symptoms of osteoporosis other than fracture, risk assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk for clinical events. For women, a clinical fracture risk assessment (FRAX) is appropriate at menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended for women at age 65, and earlier for those who have risk factors. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise are important for bone health at all ages, and those at high risk for fracture based on BMD or FRAX should be offered medical therapy to reduce fracture risk after an appropriate medical evaluation. Bisphosphonates can accumulate in bone, so after a period of treatment, lower risk patients may be offered a period off drug therapy. However, the effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment is discontinued, so there is no ''drug holiday'' with denosumab. Anabolic therapy can be offered to those with higher risk for fracture. Although rare safety concerns regarding atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw have received prominent attention, for patients who are appropriately treated according to National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, the benefit of hip fracture risk reduction far outweighs the risk of these uncommon side effects. Accurate information for patients and shared decisionmaking are important for acceptance and persistent with appropriate treatment.", "sections": [{"heading": "Background", "text": "O steoporosis is officially defined as ''a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture.'' 1 Many patients who have ''osteoporosis'' by bone density testing will not fracture and many fractures due to ''osteoporosis'' occur in patients whose bone density is better than the osteoporosis cut point. 2,3 Because fracture is the important sequela, I prefer to define the concern as ''a patient at high risk of fracture due, at least in part, to increased skeletal fragility.'' 4 Considering a densitometric diagnosis of ''osteoporosis'' based on femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) 2.5 SD or more below the youngadult mean (T-score -2.5 or below); or a hip fracture regardless of BMD; or a clinical vertebral, proximal humerus, pelvis, or distal forearm fracture with a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5; or fracture risk assessment (FRAX) score at the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation intervention thresholds ( \u20213% for hip fracture or \u202120% for major osteoporotic fracture), the prevalence of affected persons is 16.5 million in the United States, 9.2 million of whom are women-approximately 30% of women aged \u202150. 5 Fractures can be serious, costly, and result in disability and even death. Although osteoporosis (low bone mass) can occur at any age and in both sexes, it is more common in women than men (peak bone mass is lower in women than in men and men have no universal equivalent to menopause, when there is accelerated bone loss over about a decade). Fractures are also more common in women than men, in part, because of lower bone mass and also because there is less competing mortality (women tend to live longer than men). In postmenopausal women, fractures due to osteoporosis are more common than stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer combined. 6 For women aged 50, the lifetime risk of a fracture due to osteoporosis is 50%. A fracture can be a life changing event and may represent a significant threat to personal independence.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Fracture Risk Assessment", "text": "Skeletal fragility and high fracture risk can occur at any age, in any race, and either sex, but is more common in women than men and increasingly common with advancing age. A fracture with minimal or moderate trauma should lead to further evaluation-clearly fractures of the long bones (arms, legs), spine, and pelvis are associated with increased risk of future fractures at other locations, whereas fractures of ribs, knees, elbows, and shoulders (and fractures of fingers, toes, hands, feet, skull or face) are not. Other than fractures, there are no signs or symptoms of osteoporosis. Therefore, a FRAX is necessary to identify people at risk.\nIn the absence of risk factors other than sex and age, BMD measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is recommended for women at age 65 7 ; however, a clinical FRAX should be performed around age 50 (or earlier for women who undergo premature menopause) for women with risk factors: low body weight, early menopause (before about age 45), family history of osteoporosis, diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) that increase fracture risk-any of these would be a reason to order a BMD assessment sooner. 8 ", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Fundamental Measures for Bone Health", "text": "Adequate calcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing, and resistance exercise are important for bone health at any age and likely contribute to the effectiveness of medications to reduce fracture risk. The Institute of Medicine recommends a calcium intake of 1200 mg/day, ideally from foods; calcium supplements may be needed for patients whose diets do not supply sufficient calcium. Despite a flurry of reports suggesting adverse effects of calcium supplements on cardiovascular events, most evidence supports little or no safety concerns and mild benefits. 9 For vitamin D, 600-800 IU/day is recommended for public health purposes, but a supplement of 2000 IU/day is reasonable for those at increased risk of osteoporosis; serum 25-OH D levels above 30 ng/mL may be the appropriate target in such patients. 10 Walking (or a weight-bearing ''walking equivalent'' such as treadmill or elliptical) for 30-40 minutes at least three times per week would be ideal. Tai chi, yoga, and Pilates may help to maintain or improve flexibility and balance and reduce the risk of falling.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Pharmacologic Therapy", "text": "Patients at high risk of fracture should be offered medication to reduce fracture risk. The US National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends pharmacologic treatment for patients with hip or spine fractures thought to be related to osteoporosis, those with BMD 2.5 SD or more below the young normal mean (T-score -2.5 or below), and those with BMD between 1 and 2.5 SD below the young normal mean whose 10-year risk, using an on-line fracture risk calculator called FRAX (accessible at https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX) is \u20213% for hip fracture or \u202120% for major osteoporosis-related fracture (hip, humerus, forearm and clinical vertebral fracture combined). 11 Although estrogen (with or without a progestin) has been shown to improve bone mass and reduce fracture risk, 12,13 use of estrogen to reduce fracture risk has fallen out of favor for older women, but may be appropriate for younger postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms who also have low BMD. 14 Skeletal benefits of estrogen resolve quickly when treatment is stopped, but there does not seem to be a rebound increase in the risk for hip fractures or all fractures. 15 There are no data on risk of vertebral fractures after stopping estrogen.\nSome of the medications shown to reduce fracture risk are shown in the Table 1. For simplicity, they are considered as either ''antiresorptive'' or ''anabolic'' (although these terms do not fully capture the issues). Most commonly used are the antiresorptives, four of which (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab) have been shown to reduce the risk of spine, hip, and nonvertebral fractures. Although evidence for fracture reduction is equally strong for these four agents, long-term gains in BMD seem to be better with denosumab. 16 For most patients in a primary care setting, a lowcost generic oral bisphosphonate is often appropriate. Oral bisphosphonates must be taken on an empty stomach, with water only (but enough water to minimize the chance that the tablet will stick in the esophagus) with a 30 minute wait before taking anything else by mouth other than water. Zoledronic acid is given as an infusion once yearly and denosumab as a subcutaneous injection twice yearly. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has not been used as widely as these other agents because it has not been shown to reduce the risk of hip and other nonvertebral fractures; however, raloxifene is approved to reduce the risk of breast cancer and may be appropriate for women with osteoporosis with hip/spine discordance (BMD low in the spine, but not low in the hip).\nThe two drugs considered anabolics are teriparatide and abaloparatide. Both are given as daily subcutaneous injections for no longer than 2 years of treatment. Both have been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, but the studies with these agents have been shorter duration and relatively small, compared with the antiresorptives, and specific hip fracture reduction has not been shown. Gains ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "WATTS", "text": "in BMD appear greater and faster with abaloparatide, and fracture risk reduction with abaloparatide is at least as good as teriparatide and may be better. 17 These drugs are mostly used by specialists rather than primary care providers. Treatment to reduce fracture risk is a long-term proposition. It is unlikely that medication for any chronic condition (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis) can be stopped after a finite period with no further intervention needed. Thus, the anabolic agents mentioned above, although limited to 2 years of treatment, are usually followed by one of the antiresorptive agents.\nBisphosphonates accumulate in bone, so, after a period of ''loading,'' administration can be withheld for a ''drug holiday'' of at least 1 or 2 years. Limited data suggest that lower risk patients can start a ''holiday'' after 5 years of oral or 3 years of IV bisphosphonate, while higher risk patients should remain on oral treatment for 10 years or IV for at least 6 years. 18 The effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment is stopped, so there is no ''drug holiday'' with denosumab, 19 but a 10-year study supports excellent long-term safety. 16 Repeating DXA after 1-2 years of treatment and periodically after that is useful for monitoring treatment. 10 If bone density decreases or a fracture occurs, the patient should be reevaluated and treatment options reconsidered.\nBefore initiating pharmacologic treatment, laboratory studies should include calcium and creatinine (antiresorptive medication are contraindicated if hypocalcemia is present and bisphosphonates, either oral or IV, should not be given if kidney function is reduced-GFR should be above 30 or 35 mL/minutes). It is helpful to have a complete blood count, chemistry panel, serum phosphorus, and 25-OH D, which may uncover other health issues that need attention. 10 ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Safety Concerns", "text": "Two rare safety issues have been associated with bisphosphonates and denosumab and have received widespread coverage in the lay press. Much of my time with patients involves lengthy discussions about osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femoral fractures (AFF). ONJ was first reported in 2003 in cancer patients receiving doses of zoledronic acid *10 \u2022 higher than doses used to treat osteoporosis. In head-to-head trials in cancer patients, high-dose denosumab, *12 \u2022 higher than doses used to treat osteoporosis, was also found to be associated with ONJ, incidence for both zoledronic acid and denosumab is 1%-2% per year. 20 The incidence with lower doses and other drugs used to treat osteoporosis is thought to be around 1 in 10,000. ONJ can be extensive, painful, and disabling; however, most cases are localized, often painless, and respond to surgical removal of involved bone, antiseptic mouth rinse, and systemic antibiotics. 21 AFF involve the femoral shaft, occur with little or no trauma, are often preceded by weeks or months of prodromal groin or thigh pain and *30% are bilateral. They begin early as a lateral stress reaction with a lucent horizontal line and progress to become an oblique fracture with a medial spike. 22 (''Typical'' femur fractures, on the contrary, involve the hip, usually caused by the impact of a fall, affect only the side on which the patient landed, and have no warning symptoms). Surgical treatment of AFF involve placement of an intramedullary rod. Not only are AFF uncommon (*1-5 per 10,000 person years) but also mortality is much lower than that of the usual hip fracture. 23 Recent reports are suggestive of a small but important increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures following discontinuation of denosumab. 24 Although it is tempting to consider stopping medication when a goal is reached, it is important to realize that none of our medications for chronic diseases has a prolonged durable effect.

Crosssectional studies have suggested that HIV-infected women are more likely to be overweight than men, but observational studies evaluating sex differences in body mass index (BMI) increases following ART initiation are conflicting. Materials and Methods: We pooled data from three randomized clinical trials of ART initiation in persons with HIV in the United States. BMIs were compared between 760 women and 3041 men to test whether BMI changes in the first 96 weeks following initiation of ART differed by sex at birth. Linear regression estimated the relationship between sex and change in BMI from pre-ART initiation to week 96. Results: After 96 weeks, women gained an average of 1.91 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-2.19), men gained an average of 1.39 kg/m 2 (95% CI 1.30-1.48); p for sex difference <0.001; the sex difference persisted within each pre-ART initiation BMI subgroup. After adjusting for pre-ART initiation age, CD4+ count, HIV-1 viral load, race/ethnicity, study, and ART regimen, mean BMI change for women was 0.59 kg/m 2 (95% CI 0.37-0.81) more than for men ( p < 0.001).

This effect was independent of age and ART regimen, and remained after controlling for pre-ART CD4 count and HIV-1 viral load. A large part of the BMI increase occurred in the first 48 weeks following initiation of ART, and we found significant interactions between sex and baseline CD4+ count and HIV-1 viral load such that the estimated BMI increases in women with higher baseline viral loads and CD4+ counts were even greater. From subgroup analysis where additional characteristics were available, we found that the estimated sex difference was not modified by SES, alcohol or illicit drug use, or the metabolic syndrome, but current or former smoking status mitigated the estimated sex difference on BMI change.\nAlthough similar proportions of women and men moved to a worse BMI category, we found that among participants moving to a worse BMI category, women gained more weight than men. Evaluating changes in both BMI category change and absolute BMI change by sex was an essential exercise because sex differences could have been missed or underestimated if either of these endpoints had been evaluated in isolation.\nThere are conflicting reports in the literature on the relationship between sex and changes in BMI following the initiation of ART. [15][16][17][18] Our study benefits from the large number of participants and the comprehensive and uniform data that were gathered on participants in the setting of randomized clinical trials within a single HIV treatment network. We found that even after controlling for multiple potential confounders such as age, baseline CD4+ count, baseline HIV-1 viral load, race/ethnicity, study, and study treatment group, there was a robust relationship between female sex and greater increase in BMI after ART initiation. Each ART regimen was evaluated individually rather than by class (e.g., protease inhibitors [PIs] vs. non-PIs), given prior studies have not shown differences in body composition changes in PI-based regimens compared to non-PI-based regimens. 29 The underlying reason for the relationship between female sex and greater BMI gain is not known, but deserves further exploration.\nA state of chronic inflammation and immune activation has been described in HIV 30 and immune activation has been shown to be most robust in those with low CD4+ counts and high HIV-1 viral loads, 31 the subgroup in which we observed the greatest difference in BMI changes. This effect is seen in both resource-rich and resource-poor settings. 32 Adipose tissue is increasingly recognized as an important metabolically active tissue and a source of bioactive peptides that participate in inflammation and immunity. A complex interplay of factors mediated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling results in disordered inflammatory regulation. 33 Adipose tissue has been demonstrated to produce over 50 cytokines 34 from adipocytes, macrophages, or other cells of the monocyte lineage. 35 Adipocytes induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including those interleukins associated with increased mortality and noninfectious morbidities in HIV-infected individuals, such as interleukin-6. 36,37 Leptin, a key proinflammatory adipokine, is associated with an inflammatory state in the setting of obesity and its synthesis is increased by female sex hormones. 38 We hypothesize that different states of immune activation may underlie the sex difference in BMI gain that we observed in this study. Indeed, prior studies have found that several markers of immune activation are higher in HIV-infected women than in men, 39 and some markers of inflammation have been associated with greater gains in fat after ART. 40,41 There are several limitations to our study that deserve consideration. One of the ART regimens used in one of the studies, lopinavir/ritonavir, is no longer in common use in the United States. Inclusion of participants randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz may be viewed as a limitation, but the overall results were similar in the A5257 subgroup analysis, and this study included only modern ART regimens. Although we did not have complete data on covariates such as tobacco use, alcohol/substance abuse, physical activity, diet, or SES, we were able to perform a subgroup analysis on A5257 participants to adjust for some of these important variables (SES as defined by highest education attained, alcohol and illicit drug use, smoking, and history of metabolic syndrome). We chose to use education level as a surrogate for SES because this is the only covariate that was available. We recognize that this analysis could have benefited from a more sensitive analysis of SES if additional indicators had been available. Given the randomized nature of the three studies, it is unlikely that the unmeasured covariates would have biased our estimates. Finally, since this was a post hoc analysis with multiple comparisons, marginally significant associations should be interpreted with caution.\nOne additional point to consider is that, although BMI has been used in many studies and is linked to outcomes such as diabetes and other metabolic diseases, [42][43][44] the results must be interpreted with the understanding that BMI does not allow us to differentiate between fat and lean body mass. While BMI typically correlates with the proportion of total body fat, a normal BMI may represent excess adiposity in persons with low muscle mass. Women in general have lower total muscle mass than men and BMI may therefore underestimate the sex differences in changes in adiposity following the initiation of ART. In addition, current research suggests that the location and type of fat may be important in the inflammatory response and the resultant adverse outcomes. Visceral obesity has been implicated in cardiovascular morbidity 45 and further work with this cohort will investigate sex differences in the changes in regional body fat distribution after ART.\nIn conclusion, we found that in the setting of randomized clinical trials, HIV-1-infected women experienced a significantly greater increase in BMI following ART initiation than men. The fact that these sex differences exist, among persons who are already overweight before starting ART, suggests a problem of clinical significance to women living with HIV. Future work will explore the impact of immune activation on the observed sex differences.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank the study coordinators and participants at each of the study sites for their contributions to this work.

Background: Conservative management of GTPS is poorly described, and to date, there have been no studies on education with exercise as an intervention for GTPS. Ninety-four postmenopausal women with GTPS were recruited to participate in this study. Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to receive one of two 12-week exercise programs (GLoBE vs. sham). Participants received education on avoiding tendon compression with appropriate activity modification. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal tendon (VISA-G) was examined at baseline, 12, and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included hip pain and function questionnaires (Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), and Lateral Hip Pain questionnaire), a global rating of change in symptom questionnaire, and a quality of life measure (Assessment of Quality of Life [AQoL]-8D). Differences between groups were analyzed using intention to treat with analysis of covariance, per-protocol analysis, and responder analysis. Results: Responders to the GLoBE intervention had significantly better VISA-G, HOOS, OHS, and lateral hip pain questionnaire scores compared to responders in the sham group. However, intention to treat analyses showed no between-group differences for the GLoBE intervention and sham exercise groups. Significant improvement in VISA-G score was found for both programs at 12-and 52-weeks time points ( p < 0.001). Conclusion: Lack of treatment effect was found with the addition of an exercise program to a comprehensive education on GTPS management. The improved outcomes of the responders in the GLoBE group indicate that there may be a subgroup of patients with a GTPS diagnosis that benefit from a GLoBE intervention program.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "G reater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common complaint in primary healthcare, particularly in women aged between 45 and 63 years. 1 The condition involves pathology of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons (gluteal tendinopathy) and/or trochanteric bursa (trochanteric bursitis). [2][3][4][5] Those with the condition commonly describe intermittent or continuous pain at, or around, the greater trochanter of the femur while sitting, stair climbing, walking, and lying on their side. 6 GTPS has negative implications on employment and quality of life, which mimic that experienced by people with severe hip osteoarthritis (OA) awaiting hip arthroplasty. 7 The reported incidence of GTPS is 1.8 per 1000 patients per year in primary care, 1 and the prevalence rate of GTPS is 23.5% in women at risk of knee OA 8 and 54% in recipients of renal transplants. 9 In comparison, the prevalence of hip OA is 26% in females over 55 years. 10 The conservative management of GTPS is poorly described, despite the plethora of studies on injection therapy, shockwave, and surgical interventions for the lateral hip region. 11 To date, there have been no studies on education as an intervention for GTPS, and study by Rompe et al. 12 is the only study to investigate the use of an exercise program for the management of GTPS. Rompe et al. 12 compared exercise therapy with corticosteroid injection and shock wave therapy and found that exercise therapy was less effective for selfreported pain and recovery levels than corticosteroid injection at 1 month follow-up, but was superior at the 15-month follow-up, indicating longer-term benefits. It is possible that in the short term, some exercises used by Rompe et al. 12 (piriformis and iliotibial band stretching) may have aggravated the condition by increasing tendinous compression, and by the 15-month follow-up, participants had stopped completing potentially provocative exercises. This limitation will be addressed in the current study using GLoBE exercise and education on posture and activity modification, to reduce compression of the gluteal tendons.\nSince exercise has been reported to be the best intervention for other lower limb tendons (Achilles 13 and patellar tendinopathy 14 ), a similar treatment algorithm for the gluteal tendons may be effective in reducing pain and dysfunction. Both eccentric and heavy slow resistance exercise have been shown to be beneficial 15,16 for rehabilitating tendon conditions. More recently, isometric contractions have been reported to target both peripheral and central pain drivers by releasing cortical inhibition and reducing tendon pain immediately and for 45 minutes postintervention in the laboratory 17 and during in-season training in those suffering with patellar tendinopathy. 18 The effect of exercise on pain or dysfunction associated with GTPS requires investigation.\nThe aim of the current study was to determine the effects of education with targeted or sham exercise on pain and function in postmenopausal women with GTPS.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design", "text": "This was a participant-blinded, single-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 12-week (primary outcome time point) and 52-week follow-up.

Education was consistent between groups and focused on decreasing compression of the gluteal tendons over the greater trochanter. Mechanical compression has been reported to cause adaptive changes in tendon with the formation of fibrocartilage, increased proteoglycan production, 29 and increased cross-sectional area. 30 Similarly, compressive and tensile load, in isolation, but more importantly in combination, can have negative implications for pathology resulting in pain 31 and dysfunction. Thus, a reduction in these loads should result in pain relief and increased function.\nNo studies have evaluated the benefits of an education program in the management of GTPS. However, education to avoid aggravating activities has been recommended as a management strategy for the condition 32 and is being used in ongoing RCTs. 19,33 Education principles were discussed with each participant and were applied to their specific activities of daily living, sport, and recreation. This may have enabled easy translation and uptake of these strategies and contributed to a reduction in pain and symptoms. Education and advice on activities of daily living may have provided this group of postmenopausal women with enough pain relief to undertake activities at a sufficient level of function and improve quality of life (AQoL). However, it remains unclear if these improvements were solely due to the education, whether in fact the sham exercises contributed to this improvement or it was improvement over time, regardless of intervention. Without a wait-and-see group the influence of time cannot be estimated; however, since almost half the cohort were no better (no change in pain) at 52 weeks, the impact of time may not be particularly relevant in this population. This reflects the chronic recalcitrant nature of the condition. Thus, it is likely that the education underpinned the improvements that were seen, rather than this being due to the natural recovery of the condition. This is especially true in GTPS where simple lifestyle amendments can impact on pain, perhaps more so than other conditions such as hip OA. Future research could involve a comparison with an education only group and/or a change over time group.\nThe effect of placebo on significant within-group changes cannot be underestimated. It has been found that open-label placebo treatment reduces pain and disability in chronic lowback pain sufferers, compared to usual treatment over a 3week period. 34 Although GTPS participants were blinded to group allocation in this study, they were made aware of the potential to receive an exercise program not targeting rehabilitation of GTPS alongside education. Furthermore, both interventions were delivered by a qualified physiotherapist in a clinical setting, with equal enthusiasm for the program.\nThe primary structure contributing to nociceptive input could alter the response to exercise intervention. Since the cause of tendon pain is not known 35 and the pathophysiology of GTPS is poorly understood, it is plausible that responders in the GLoBE group had primary tendon pathology known to benefit from isometric exercise. 17 Comorbidities in other structures around the hip (e.g., labral tear, chondropathy) could impact on the response to the exercise programs. Responders to the GLoBE exercise and education program had significantly greater improvements in their outcome measures compared with the responders in the sham exercise and education program. This may indicate that there is a subgroup of people with GTPS who respond better (improved pain and function) to a GLoBE exercise program with education than with a sham exercise program with education. Further analysis of subgroup characteristics using the current data was not undertaken since adequately powered responder analysis requires a greater sample size to allow for dichotomizing continuous variables and to identify characteristics of subgroups. 36,37 Heterogeneity within a group of participants can diminish the likelihood of significant treatment effects 38 as only a certain proportion of the group will be responsive to the given treatment intervention. This has been shown in low-back pain disorders 39 and patellofemoral joint pain 40 whereby targeted interventions for subgroups have been effective in reducing pain and dysfunction and recommended in hip chondropathy studies. 41 With adequate power for subgroup analysis, the level of pain and disability at baseline, personal, and pathophysiological factors could be examined to determine likely responsiveness to treatment intervention.\nThe GLoBE exercise intervention was designed with the intention to load the gluteal tendons in functional positions without causing compression. Interestingly, only two participants in the GLoBE exercise program were unable to complete the hip hitch exercise at the first appointment due to increased lateral hip pain and instead were prescribed an alternative bilateral standing isometric abduction exercise until they were able to resume the GLoBE intervention protocol. This indicates that the majority of postmenopausal women with GTPS can tolerate standing isometric hip exercises at first presentation.

For a more thorough evaluation of the effects of each individual program, physical outcome measures (muscle strength and objective functional tests) may be considered important to investigate the specificity required in therapeutic exercise and also provide direction for mechanistic studies. Similarly, it would have been beneficial to collect data on participation in sport, physical activity, and duration of GTPS symptoms, to detect the benefits of each exercise program in particular subgroups. Results did not control for medication use (therapeutic or medicinal), but randomization may account for this potential confounder.\nDue to the pragmatic nature of the study, it was more cost effective and time efficient to collect baseline data at the first physiotherapy appointment, rather than before randomization as outlined in the protocol. 19 Consequently, baseline measures were not received for four participants, and these participants were excluded from the intention to treat analysis.\nThe use of 23 physiotherapists to implement the intervention made it difficult to ensure that each clinician adhered to the exercise protocol, potentially affecting results. However, auditing clinical notes, standardized training, and prescription of exercises based on provided booklets aimed to ensure consistent treatment administration.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Future research", "text": "This single-arm trial may indicate that education is largely responsible for within-group changes; however, a wait and see approach is required to assess whether improvements in both groups are attributable to the natural history of the condition.

Research to identify these patients would assist clinicians to implement appropriate management strategies for individual rehabilitation. It is possible that there are exercises, not yet researched, that are more effective at reducing GTPS pain and dysfunction than those identified in this study. Thus, comparison of the GLoBE exercise program with other exercise programs is important to consider. Furthermore, only half of the globe group progressed to the end of the program by 12 weeks.

We estimated reintervention rates for 5 years and identified predictors of reintervention. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted in women in MarketScan \u00d2 Commercial Claims and Encounters (Truven Health Analytics) aged 18-49 years with UF diagnosis before myomectomy, EA, or UAE from 2008 to 2014.

Hysterectomy involves removing the uterus, which typically requires hospitalization and can be associated with a lengthy recovery period, and eliminates the ability to carry a pregnancy. 4 Many women elect to undergo potentially less invasive procedures than hysterectomy, including myomectomy, endometrial ablation (EA), and uterine artery embolization (UAE), in order to conserve their uterus, avoid prolonged recovery times, or potentially retain fertility with myomectomy. These procedures are considered reasonable alternatives to hysterectomy, given their safety profile, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life scores. 5 Numerous factors affect which intervention a patient undergoes, including symptom profile, patient preferences regarding recovery period and fertility, insurance, fibroid characteristics (location, number, and size), presence or absence of coexisting pathology, and experience of the physician. 6 Specific comorbidities such as menstrual disorders and pelvic pain may also influence the treatment decision. 7 Patients who undergo a more conservative approach than hysterectomy would prefer to avoid additional procedures, but there is limited recent evidence describing long-term reintervention rates with direct comparisons between myomectomy, EA, and UAE, especially in large samples with >1-year of follow-up observation. 8 Existing evidence primarily comes from clinical trials with only two comparison arms or surveys of patients with variable follow-up periods that often do not adjust for patient characteristics potentially relevant to the treatment decision.\nLong-term comparative analysis of patients undergoing procedures for symptoms of UF is an identified research priority; the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded in 2011 that ''currently available literature is insufficient to draw conclusions about the relative benefits, harms, or costs of the available choices, making it difficult for patients, providers, payers, and others to select appropriate treatments.'' 8 Several studies have examined reintervention after UAE, including the EMMY, REST, and HOPEFUL trials, which reported cumulative reintervention rates ranging from 23% to 32% for 5-7 years. [9][10][11][12] Reintervention was less common (16%) in a survey of women in the U.K. 5-7 years after UAE and in the U.S. fibroid registry in the 3 years after UAE (14%). 13,14 Fewer recent studies have been performed for myomectomy and EA. Two U.S. studies in the early 2000s estimated cumulative 5year reintervention rates of 24% after myomectomy and 22% for hysterectomy after EA. 15,16 Lastly, a large retrospective analysis of U.K. women who underwent EA found a cumulative 5-year reintervention rate of 17%. However, these studies were generally conducted on a broader population of patients with menorrhagia, which may be due to causes other than UF. 17 Limited studies have directly compared reintervention rates across treatment options for patients with UF. A higher but not statistically significant number of patients received repeat interventions after abdominal myomectomy (14%) than after UAE (8%) in a study for 50-83 months. 18 In a long-term U.K. study, reintervention rates were 31% for UAE versus 26% for EA versus 25% for myomectomy for a maximum follow-up of 11 years. 19 A recent analysis of U.S. electronic health records found that EA had the highest hazard of reintervention, followed by myomectomy, then UAE. 20 Finally, a large analysis of U.S. commercial claims for women with symptomatic UF found that a significantly higher proportion of women who underwent UAE had reinterventions than those who had a myomectomy (17% vs. 15%); however, this study did not consider EA or myomectomy subtypes. 21 Depending upon the extent of fibroids, priorities of the patient, and experience of the physician, myomectomy procedures can be abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic. 22 Laparoscopic myomectomy has increased in popularity due to lower rates of hemorrhage, shorter postoperative hospital stays, and less postoperative pain than abdominal myomectomy; however, the comparative risk of recurrence of fibroids and need for reintervention remain uncharacterized. [23][24][25][26] UF-related treatment is associated with substantial healthcare utilization, which results in significant increases in direct and indirect costs. 27,28 Interventional procedures for UF are expensive, and treatment selection has cost implications for several years. 4,29 Evidence exists that the need for reintervention following nondefinitive procedures significantly reduces or eliminates the initial cost-benefit relative to hysterectomy. 10 The objectives of this research were to evaluate rates of reintervention after myomectomy (all known types and divided into the following three subtypes: abdominal, laparoscopic, and hysteroscopic), EA, and UAE for patients with UF in a large commercial claims data set and to identify patient characteristics and comorbidities associated with risk of reintervention.", "n_publication_ref": 32, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design and data source", "text": "A retrospective analysis of longitudinal patient-level data was conducted using the MarketScan \u00d2 Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI).

The goal of this research is to inform patients, providers, and insurers of average rates of reintervention after myomectomy (of known type combined and by subtype, exclusive of  unknown procedures), EA, and UAE for symptomatic UF patients. This builds on prior research, which mostly relied on surveys with limited comparison between treatments in the same population. This study of a large nationally representative commercially insured population found that 4%-12% of UF patients had a reintervention within the first year. EA is associated with the highest rate of reintervention, with Kaplan-Meier estimates indicating a 33% likelihood of reintervention for the 5 years after the initial procedure, followed by UAE at 24% and myomectomy at 19% (all differences statistically significant). Of the three myomectomy subtypes, abdominal had the lowest rate of reintervention, followed by laparo-scopic then hysteroscopic. Age-and UF-related comorbidities significantly affected the hazard of reintervention.\nMany factors should be considered before making a choice of therapy, including patient preferences and attributes of specific modalities. Patients who wish to maintain fertility may opt for myomectomy instead of EA. Conversely, patients who experience heavy bleeding may be more likely to undergo EA or UAE. Myomectomy has been associated with the longest recuperation period, and UAE with the shortest. 33 Absenteeism and disability days follow a similar trend. 4 EA has been shown to be the least expensive, in terms of payments from the insurer to providers, and UAE the most expensive. 4,34 Quality-of-life differences reported to date in the year after intervention have not been appreciably different, although this is an area of active research. 33,35,36 Rate of reintervention is another factor that patients and providers could consider when selecting treatment. The reintervention rate estimates for each procedure type are generally consistent with prior research. A similar claimsbased study in the U.S. evaluating women treated for uterine leiomyoma also reported a higher cumulative incidence of reintervention for UAE than for myomectomy (17% vs. 15%) after a mean follow-up of 3.4 years. 21 Although the overall reintervention rates were lower than those found in this study, they were higher for patients with 5 years of data (23% vs. 27%), suggesting differential follow-up could have affected the results. In addition, their study did not consider EA as a reintervention and used a broader definition of UF while also requiring bulk symptoms that could have influenced the treatment selection.\nAnother study in the U.K. found that cumulative incidences of reintervention after myomectomy (25%) and EA (26%) were lower than after UAE (31%) over a maximum of 11 years, and estimated 12-month reintervention rates of 10%, 13%, and 14% for myomectomy, EA, and UAE, respectively, relative to 4%, 12%, and 7% in our study. 19 Discrepancies between the results could potentially be due to the longer follow-up period in their study and differences in the U.K. patient population and treatment practices. As the authors note, increased use of UAE and EA in the UK during the study period may have impacted reintervention rates. 19 For UAE, the 5-year reintervention rate falls within the range reported from the EMMY, REST, and HOPEFUL trials. [9][10][11][12] The myomectomy reintervention rate estimate is only slightly lower than that reported in an earlier retrospective analysis of patients who underwent myomectomy from 1993 through 2002. 15 The reintervention rate estimates by myomectomy subtypes are also consistent with previous research that has shown similar recurrence rates between abdominal and laparoscopic myomectomies, but higher recurrence rates for hysteroscopic myomectomies. 23,[37][38][39] This phenomenon is not surprising in that patients who undergo hysteroscopic myomectomy may have other fibroids that are not addressed during the initial surgery and are more likely to experience incomplete fibroid resection. Although the reintervention rate for EA is higher than in prior studies, those studies included a broader population of women with menorrhagia and noted that the subset with UF had increased risk of reintervention. 17 Similar to the results of this study, several studies have reported higher rates of reintervention after UAE relative to myomectomy. 11,33,40 Only a single other U.S. study has directly compared myomectomy, EA, and UAE, finding reintervention hazard rates of 0.67 (CI, 0.54-0.84) for myomectomy and 0.55 (CI, 0.39-0.79) for UAE relative to EA. 20 Approximating their model specification, we find a similar estimate for UAE (HR, 0.61; CI, 0.56-0.66), but a lower estimate for myomectomy (HR, 0.39; CI, 0.36-0.42). This discrepancy could be due to different primary insurers or because they include a covariate for race, which we did not have access to in our research. In addition, their study relied on older data (2005-2011) and a smaller population, which may have different usage of specific myomectomy procedures associated with higher rates of reintervention, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy.\nThis study uses a large recent insurance claims database to compare nonhysterectomy options for treating patients with symptomatic UF. Prior estimates of reintervention rates were primarily from surveys or clinical trials that often relied on small samples and variable follow-up periods due to patient attrition. The majority compared at most two procedures, with limited adjustment for risk factors or treatment history. Using an insurance claims database allows for a direct comparison of multiple procedure types after adjusting for patient characteristics and health history. Administrative claims data provide certain strengths. For example, they typically allow for analysis of larger samples than are available in clinical trials and contain extensive longitudinal information. In addition, claims data more accurately reflect real-world patterns of medical resource use not affected by monitoring and enrollment biases in clinical trials. Furthermore, relying on claims data avoids biases inherent in patientreported outcomes.\nA limitation of claims data is that disease severity and other clinical variables are absent from the data; however, in this case, patients reported herein had sufficient symptoms to require an interventional procedure. Although a UF diagnosis was required, it is possible that patients underwent the interventions examined primarily for conditions or symptoms unrelated to UF. Even if the procedure was for UF, we could not determine with certainty whether UF-related pain or bleeding ultimately led to the intervention, or whether treatment decisions were influenced by other comorbidities. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease or prior ovarian cystectomy showed similar results.\nFurthermore, the data did not allow for differentiation between unexpected reinterventions and planned completion procedures. In addition, the data set is restricted to commercially insured patients, so generalizability to a broader population (such as those with government-provided insurance) may be limited. The inclusion criteria did not allow generalization of results to women with endometriosis or prior oophorectomy, nor to women who had UF-related procedures without a concurrent UF diagnosis recorded. Patients with an initial intervention of myomectomy of an unknown type were also excluded from the study; however, results were largely unchanged in a sensitivity analysis after including these patients.\nIt is possible that differences in outcomes may be attributable to factors unobservable in claims data, in addition to the observed treatment decisions, such as desire to maintain fertility, clinical characteristics (e.g., number, location, and size of fibroids), health plan, and provider specialty. EA may not be directly comparable with UAE and myomectomy because it specifically targets menorrhagia associated with UF, instead of the fibroids themselves. Presence of heavy bleeding is controlled for in multivariate analyses along with other symptoms of UF, such as pelvic pain; however, claims data are limited in determining the precise reason for treatment selection and/or reintervention.

Although selection of a particular intervention should be specific to the patient, provider, and clinical profile, the risk of requiring reintervention should be an important consideration when determining the appropriate treatment approach for patients with UF, given the cost and patient burden of additional interventions. The interventions examined in this study differ in important dimensions beyond rates of reintervention and should not be viewed as interchangeable or perfectly substitutable. Additional research should further examine the implications of treatment selection by assessing the risk of procedural complications, the need for additional medical treatment for UF, and the cost consequences of reintervention.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Scott Johnson, PhD, of Medicus Economics provided medical writing and editing services.

This article describes how public health departments implement and use LOCATe in their jurisdictions.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P erinatal regionalization, also referred to as riskappropriate care, is a strategy for improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes that the March of Dimes initially proposed in the 1976 report, toward improving the outcome of pregnancy (TIOP I). 1 Risk-appropriate care provisions support women and infants receiving care in a facility staffed with personnel and equipment that matches their risk. Facilities are classified into levels based on functional capabilities and organized within a tiered, regionalized system of perinatal care. 2 In response to TIOP I, states began to develop coordinated regional systems for perinatal care. In addition to facilities with a range of capabilities, these systems may include a regional (or tertiary) care center. Regional centers provide both the highest level of perinatal care and support lower level facilities with education, outreach, and maternal and neonatal transport.\nSubsequent versions of TIOP and editions of the Guidelines for Perinatal Care broadened the focus beyond neonatal care to include comprehensive perinatal care and definitions for levels of care based on the most recent published evidence. 3,4 Improved outcomes have been demonstrated for high-risk infants (e.g., very preterm or with serious medical and/or surgical conditions) when delivered at higher level facilities equipped to manage their conditions, with a metaanalysis in 2010 concluding that very low birthweight (<1500 g) and very preterm (<32 weeks gestational age) infants born in level III or higher facilities experience decreased mortality. 5 These findings further highlight the importance of coordinated systems of risk-appropriate care.\nIn 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an updated policy statement on Levels of Neonatal Care. 2 The 2012 statement updates recommendations for designation of levels of newborn care (levels I-IV) based on specific facility capabilities. While studies have found that units with a lower volume of deliveries are associated with higher mortality, evidence remains insufficient to support specific volume recommendations, and so remain absent from the 2012 AAP guidance. 6,7 The policy statement discusses the importance of using standardized terminology to encourage comparison across facilities and regions and to improve accuracy and reporting of statistics and performance measures.\nWhile the initial development of levels of care included maternal and neonatal provisions, the framework of perinatal regions and systems has generally focused on the neonate. In response to increasing levels of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, 8,9 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) published the Obstetric Care Consensus: Levels of Maternal Care, in 2015. 10 The structure of the newly developed maternal levels of care recommendations is similar to the neonatal levels; each level (I-IV, plus birth centers) describes minimum capabilities related to facility staffing and equipment. Furthermore, the publication provides guidance that congruency between maternal and neonatal level is not the goal, but rather that a pregnant woman receives care in a facility that best meets her needs and those of the neonate. Both maternal guidance and neonatal guidance place importance on measurement and evaluation of health outcomes by reviewing facility data, as well as the role that regional centers play in coordinating transport and outreach education within their area.\nWhile almost half of states currently have levels of neonatal care criteria defined in policy, definitions and monitoring vary widely. The specific criteria and monitoring mechanisms used for level designation can include functional criteria, utilization criteria, compliance mechanisms, regulatory sources, or a combination of these. A systematic web search in 2008 found that 22 states reference or cite AAP documents as part of their designation process. Some states choose to develop legislation that supports perinatal levels of care for regulatory and reimbursement purposes, while other states do not designate levels of care. 11 This wide range of mechanisms results in a lack of consistency and presents a challenge for national efforts focused on increasing opportunities for collaboration and improvement of maternal and neonatal care.\nStates and jurisdictions engaged in the Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network to Reduce Infant Mortality (IM CoIIN) identified maternal and neonatal risk-appropriate care as one of six priority strategies. This multiyear national movement engages federal, state, and local leaders, as well as public and private agencies, professionals, and communities to use quality improvement, innovation, and collaborative learning for reducing infant mortality and improving birth outcomes. 12 Specifically, this strategy team aims to increase the delivery of higher risk infants and mothers at an appropriate level facility. The IM CoIIN risk-appropriate care strategy teams expressed difficulty in monitoring levels of care among facilities and highlighted the importance of developing a consistent and uniform method for assessing levels of care. We describe here how the CDC and jurisdictions developed a tool that addresses the need identified for a user-friendly and standardized approach that states can use to assess maternal and neonatal care capabilities of facilities.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CDC LOCATe Development and Implementation", "text": "The CDC Levels of Care Assessment Tool (LOCATe) was developed to provide standardized assessments that align with the 2015 ACOG/SMFM 11 and 2012 AAP 6 guidance and encourage conversations among stakeholders in the provision of risk-appropriate care. The CDC developed a web-based assessment tool with sections specific to both maternal and neonatal care capabilities of the responding facility (www.cdc .gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/LOCATe.html). To keep respondent burden to a minimum, the assessment focuses on collecting information necessary to distinguish between levels of care. The content of CDC LOCATe primarily came from the 2015 ACOG/SMFM Levels of Maternal Care and 2012 AAP Levels of Neonatal Care guidance, and can be divided into four categories. The first group of questions corresponds directly to criteria in the guidance and used to assess levels. The second group also corresponds with the criteria, but the response options have greater specificity than the guidance. There are places in the guidance where the wording is insufficient to support specificity, accommodating a variety of interpretations by respondents. For example, the ACOG/SMFM Levels of Maternal Care guidance categorizes access to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist on-site, by phone or by telemedicine equally, while CDC LOCATe separates these availability options. This approach allows responses to be assessed consistently with the guidance, while simultaneously collecting data for stakeholder analysis on possible differences in outcomes based on the type of availability of a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.\nThe third group of questions does not directly come from existing criteria, but rather from gaps identified by stakeholders in the evidence used to inform the development of criteria. For example, LOCATe includes questions about the volume of procedures (e.g., pediatric surgery) and volume of high-risk patients (e.g., very preterm deliveries). This information is not used for assessing levels, but to support stakeholders in developing the evidence they may need to best inform risk-appropriate care activities.\nThe fourth grouping of information gathered by LOCATe is based on language included in the AAP and ACOG/SMFM levels of care guidance but is not used in assessing levels of care. This information is collected to inform stakeholder conversations. Among these expanded questions is a series related to level of care self-designation and the source of that designation. The maternal section includes questions on a facility's current protocols and drills performed for three major maternal events: obstetric hemorrhage, hypertensive emergency, and thromboembolism. LOCATe ends with a section that includes different statistics about the hospital. The neonatal section includes numbers of total live births and number of live births less than 1500 g and less than 32 weeks of gestation. The maternal section includes number of maternal deaths before discharge and women who were admitted to the intensive care unit or received four or more units of blood, the standard criteria used to estimate severe maternal morbidity. This information can be useful for the jurisdiction implementation team and their stakeholders in identifying quality improvement opportunities outside of the guidelines or generating measures used for monitoring performance of risk-appropriate care systems.\nA small group of states that had participated in the IM CoIIN risk-appropriate care strategy team piloted LOCATe, first among a sample of facilities in five states, and then among all facilities in two states. The implementation process has become more refined with each additional state's participation (Fig. 1).

Jurisdictions interested in implementing LOCATe are advised that the time dedicated to preparation for distribution of the tool is equally as vital as the data collection itself. Full participation from all birthing facilities in the jurisdiction is encouraged, as this approach allows a comprehensive understanding of maternal and neonatal care capabilities in their area. Implementation and use of LOCATe data vary with the resources, opportunities, and needs specific to the jurisdiction. Illinois, the Southeast Michigan Perinatal Quality Improvement Coalition (SEMP QIC), and Wyoming, are three illustrative examples of how LOCATe supports stakeholders in risk-appropriate care.\nIllinois' initial goals in implementing LOCATe were to obtain data that would enable an assessment of statewide policies and systems related to risk-appropriate care. Illinois linked LOCATe data to vital records (infant birth and death certificates) to enable detailed comparisons of patient demographics and outcomes across facilities. The Illinois analyses have revolved around answering questions related to four main topics: (1) describing the AAP and ACOG/SMFM levels of care as a statewide system and highlighting gaps in services, (2) comparing the current regionalized perinatal system to the estimated AAP and ACOG/SMFM levels of care, (3) estimating potential changes in patient volumes and geographic access to higher level facilities that might occur if the AAP levels of care were adopted, and (4) assessing between-level and within-level variation in neonatal mortality. The results of these analyses were compiled into a 25page data report that was provided to the state Levels of Care Task Force and Perinatal Advisory Committee. Based on the information provided by the LOCATe analyses, these statewide committees recommended that Illinois revises the state perinatal code to adopt the current ACOG/SMFM and AAP level of care guidelines. Work is now underway in the state to begin the process of revising the administrative code that governs the regionalized perinatal system. In the future, Illinois plans to link the LOCATe data to the hospital discharge data to further analyze infant and maternal morbidities in relation to levels of care, seeking to strengthen the evidence supporting perinatal regionalization.\nThe SEMP QIC includes a membership of perinatal providers from three highly populated counties in southeast Michigan. The births in these three counties (Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb) represent 41% of the total births in Michigan and 68% of the African American births in the state. Michigan's 3-year average (2009-2013) infant mortality rate (IMR) is 7.0 and areas in the SEMP QIC region have 3-year average IMR ranging from 11.8 to 16.1. CDC LOCATe was used as a consistent method to assess the hospital level of care available in 96% of the birthing hospitals of SEMP QIC. Inperson hospital meetings occurred to confirm responses from the assessment and collect qualitative data on the patient population of each hospital. Aggregate LOCATe results were shared with SEMP QIC participating hospitals in a 1-hour webinar and at a scheduled SEMP QIC membership meeting. The hospital-specific results were shared with responding hospital for internal use and quality improvement efforts. The data collected from the use of LOCATe and the in-person visits are being used to inform the gap analysis work of SEMP QIC and guide priority areas of focus for improvements in the regions' perinatal system of care.\nWyoming implemented LOCATe to learn about the perinatal care system in the state. LOCATe offered a standardized, relatively simple tool to capture the resources and capabilities at each Wyoming facility. State Maternal and Child Health staff are meeting with each Wyoming facility to confirm their results, and learn how levels of care are operationalized in a rural/frontier setting. A statewide perinatal level of care report will be released, which will share the assessed level of each facility. Results from LOCATe identified that several Wyoming facilities did not have specific maternal care protocols in place. As a result, Wyoming facilities are participating in the Utah Department of Health's Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) for hypertension in pregnancy. The ECHO provides a continuous learning system and connects facilities to specialist mentors at the University of Utah's medical center. It is expected that the number of Wyoming facilities that have developed a hypertension protocol will increase through participation in the ECHO. In addition, the information gleaned from LOCATe will be used to develop program activities around risk-appropriate care, which was selected by Wyoming's Maternal and Child Health Unit as a Title V Priority under the umbrella of prevention of infant mortality. In the future, Wyoming will include the data from LOCATe in its analyses of maternal and infant morbidities, and in an analysis of perinatal transport practices.\nThese examples demonstrate the flexibility of LOCATe across diverse settings as each implementation team utilized the results in alignment with needs and priorities. CDC LO-CATe provides a standardized assessment of facility levels of care, supporting collaborative approaches within and between jurisdictions to strengthen systems of risk-appropriate care. Implementation of CDC LOCATe helps place an equal importance on levels of maternal and neonatal care and allows an agency to measure a facility's capabilities in an unbiased way, anchored to national guidelines. As the number of jurisdictions that prioritize provision of risk-appropriate care systems continues to grow, adoption of CDC LOCATe may encourage collaboration at regional levels. Forging collaborations among stakeholders within and between jurisdictions will maximize the impacts of systems of riskappropriate care and ultimately improve systems of care for women and infants.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the 12 jurisdictions (California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan Southeast Perinatal Region, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wyoming) who have implemented CDC LOCATe for their collaboration and continued efforts to improve the outcomes for mothers and infants.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This article describes the process used by a National Institutes of Health funded transdisciplinary research team (The Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [PLUS] Consortium) to develop a definition of bladder health. Methods: The PLUS Consortium identified currently accepted lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and outlined elements of storage and emptying functions of the bladder. Consistent with the World Health Organization's definition of health, PLUS concluded that absence of LUTS was insufficient and emphasizes the bladder's ability to adapt to short-term physical, psychosocial, and environmental challenges for the final definition. Definitions for subjective experiences and objective measures of bladder dysfunction and health were drafted. An additional bioregulatory function to protect against infection, neoplasia, chemical, or biologic threats was proposed. Results: PLUS proposes that bladder health be defined as: ''A complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being related to bladder function and not merely the absence of LUTS. Healthy bladder function permits daily activities, adapts to short-term physical or environmental stressors, and allows optimal well-being (e.g., travel, exercise, social, occupational, or other activities).'' Definitions for each element of bladder function are reported with suggested subjective and objective measures. Conclusions: PLUS used a comprehensive transdisciplinary process to develop a bladder health definition. This will inform instrument development for evaluation of bladder health promotion and prevention of LUTS in research and public health initiatives.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "L ower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent affecting up to one in three women and girls and become increasingly common over the life course. 1,2 LUTS include patient-reported symptoms related to urine storage and emptying, which negatively impact quality of life. 3 Lower urinary tract dysfunctions such as urinary tract infections (UTIs, i.e., bladder infections), urinary incontinence (UI), overactive bladder, bladder pain syndrome/ interstitial cystitis, incomplete emptying, and bladder cancer are typically associated with LUTS. Certain medical conditions also contribute to LUTS (e.g., neurologic disease, heart disease, diabetes, constipation, and autoimmune diseases). [4][5][6] Psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental conditions can have an impact on LUTS and bladder health, particularly in young girls. [7][8][9][10] Between 20 and 40% of children and adolescents with LUTS have associated mental health conditions such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder. 11 In addition, urinary symptoms have been reported in 65.7% of young athletes. 10 In adults, LUTS have been associated with decreased sexual enjoyment, poor sleep quality, lower productivity, depression, and poor health-related quality of life. 3,[12][13][14][15][16] Alarmingly, more than 50% of seriously ill hospitalized patients >60 years of age reported that they considered death preferable to incontinence. 17 While LUTS are common in women and have a negative impact on quality of life, most women do not seek treatment. 18,19 In a survey of working women, more than one in five had experienced UI at least monthly; however, fewer than half of those women sought care. A more recent epidemiologic study linked to electronic health records of 3316 women in Pennsylvania found that only 25% of women with UI sought care. 19,20 Stigma associated with LUTS may reduce treatmentseeking behaviors. 21 Many women cope with their symptoms through limiting fluids, scheduled urination, using absorbent products (e.g., pads, panty liners), and other self-management strategies. 20 Some self-management strategies reduce symptom bother allowing normal activities, whereas others (e.g., limiting social activities) can negatively affect quality of life. The growth of marketing campaigns for absorbent products for UI (an industry estimated to reach $2.7B by 2020) may contribute to reducing stigma and increasing treatment-seeking behaviors. 22,23 Alternatively, such campaigns may normalize LUTS and reinforce perceptions that LUTS are part of aging or being female. 19,24 An unintended consequence of this normalization of LUTS is potentially a lack of awareness of and motivation to pursue promising prevention and treatment options, leading instead to unhealthy self-management, including tolerating symptoms. 25 While numerous effective treatment options for LUTS exist, there is sparse evidence informing optimal bladder health promotion and LUTS prevention strategies. Most primary prevention trials focus purely on one particular LUTS (e.g., UI) and are targeted toward women at high risk of developing LUTS. Evidence supports the use of pelvic floor exercise programs for prevention of UI during pregnancy and in older populations, but outcomes for other LUTS such as urinary infections, voiding dysfunction, or pain are unknown. [26][27][28][29] Recent reviews of primary prevention of UTIs focus on nursing home and postmenopausal women with outcomes for UTIs, but do not describe the impact on other LUTS. 30,31 Although these prevention strategies appear to be effective, we cannot know if they truly promote overall bladder health. In part, this is because current research is not informed by a standardized definition of bladder health that guides the selection of measures used to evaluate prevention efforts. To accurately identify and promote optimal bladder health, a systematic, evidence-based approach to defining bladder health across the life course is first needed. A standardized definition of bladder health can aid in the identification of factors to promote health and modify risk factors for LUTS. We propose a new paradigm to define optimal bladder health extending beyond mere lack of symptoms to include concepts of well-being and resilience to short-term challenges to health.\nThe primary objectives of this work were twofold: (1) to describe the process used by our transdisciplinary consortium to develop a working research definition of bladder health and (2) to present the resulting bladder health definition that is proposed for use in research and public health.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conceptualizing bladder health", "text": "The transdisciplinary Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Consortium is funded by the National Institutes of Health to advance research on LUTS prevention in women and girls. The purpose, organization, and function of the PLUS Consortium are described in detail by Harlow et al. 32 There was broad consensus across PLUS investigators that a definition of bladder health was a necessary first step to plan, perform, and evaluate the research required to advance LUTS prevention in women and girls. The absence of a commonly accepted definition of bladder health has hindered development of a comprehensive bladder health promotion and LUTS prevention agenda. 25,33 To date, bladder health has been framed in terms of absence of LUTS symptoms, an approach that ignores quality of life and the dynamic nature of health over the life course. 34,35 To this end, PLUS investigators acknowledged the need for a working definition of bladder health and adapted The World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health as a framework. WHO asserts that ''health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.'' 36 In addition to the WHO definition, PLUS investigators considered more recent work by Huber et al., who contend that in the age of chronic disease, complete wellbeing may be an unattainable standard, particularly at later stages in the life course; they suggest redefining health as ''the ability to adapt and to self-manage,'' recognizing the changing and multidimensional nature of health in a dynamic environment. 37 The deliberations of the PLUS investigators distinguished between two types of adaptations described by Huber et al. and others. [37][38][39] The first type of adaptationself-management-includes compensatory behaviors in response to environmental constraints on timing of urination (e.g., restricting fluid intake) and containment behaviors in response to symptoms (e.g., wearing incontinence protection to fully engage in desired activities). For better or worse, terms have been developed to define and ''medicalize'' the latter self-management strategies (i.e., contained incontinence-UI that is controlled by being contained with an DEFINING BLADDER HEALTH IN WOMEN AND GIRLS absorbent product or a collecting device). 40 The second type of adaptation-resilience-occurs throughout the life course and is consistent with the concept of allostasis, the body's capability of regaining homeostasis after physical, psychosocial, or environmental challenges to the organ system (e.g., complete recovery after a UTI). 38,41 Resilience throughout the life course may prevent the development of LUTS and therefore the need for self-management strategies (e.g., wearing incontinence protection). The PLUS Consortium emphasized the concept of resilience in developing a definition of bladder health to capture the concept as not merely the absence of LUTS, but also the bladder's ability to adapt to short-term physical, psychosocial, and environmental stressors without lasting harm to the system. [36][37][38]41 This requires a definition that addresses the concepts of well-being and resilience to stressors and is distinct from ''selfmanagement'' strategies to cope with LUTS.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Considering bladder health in women and girls across the life course", "text": "Although overall prevalence of LUTS may be similar in men and women, the mechanisms by which LUTS affect females differ from that of males. 13,42 Females are disproportionately affected by some LUTS, with women having nearly thrice higher prevalence of UI and bladder pain syndrome than men. 43,44 Therefore, the work of the PLUS Consortium is focused exclusively on women and girls, which are an understudied population with unique needs for bladder health promotion research. To understand bladder health across the life course in women and girls, it is also important to recognize biologic changes in development and exposures to risk and protective factors that occur over time. PLUS investigators intended for the proposed definition of bladder health to be used across a wide age spectrum, acknowledging changes that occur at the various stages of life and that well-being, resilience, and risk may vary over the life course. 45,46 The Consortium proposed five developmental stages important in the study of bladder health across the life course: Childhood (\u00a310 years), Adolescence (11-17 years), Emerging Adulthood (18-25 years), Adulthood (26-64 years), and Older Adulthood ( \u202165 years). Using these proposed life stages, researchers can expand understanding of risk factors for LUTS and protective factors for bladder health by identifying populations across the life course with varying degrees of bladder health. For example, novel prevention opportunities may exist for children, adolescents, and young women at various developmental time points (e.g., toilet training, school entry, puberty, sexual debut, and pregnancy).", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The PLUS process", "text": "The process began with exploration of lessons learned from other health promotion campaigns (e.g., cardiovascular health); however, the lack of evidence for bladder health risk and protective factors prohibited use of a similar mode to that used in cardiovascular health. Thus, PLUS investigators used an iterative process to define bladder health and formed a transdisciplinary Terminology, Conceptual Frameworks and Models (TCFM) group to lead the activity. The TCFM group included two co-chairs (one with clinical and another with public health expertise) and 12 investigators with expertise in urogynecology, obstetrics and gynecology, nursing, pediat-rics, geriatrics, public health, and behavioral sciences. The priority for the TCFM group was to establish a common language for PLUS, think conceptually about bladder health, and to propose a bladder health definition to the PLUS Consortium for consideration, refinement, and approval. The consortium and TCFM group's approach was consistent with Mohammed and Dumville's integrative framework of team knowledge. 47 This framework includes the processes of information sharing (i.e., group discussion and information exchange), transactive memory (i.e., utilizing group members as memory aids), group learning (i.e., construction of new knowledge by the group), and cognitive consensus (i.e., reconciling different perspectives to define and conceptualize key issues). These processes guided taskwork, teamwork, and representation of key issues. The PLUS approach to developing a bladder health definition was also similar to how another transdisciplinary group of experts studied healthcare delivery in low-and middle-income countries. 48 A framework table of bladder storage and emptying functions was initially drafted, and with collaboration from other PLUS investigators, the TCFM group mapped accepted LUTS definitions associated with various bladder dysfunctions to a list of elements of bladder function. 40,[49][50][51][52][53] Consideration of the elements of bladder function was a useful bridge in developing definitions for healthy bladder functions. In addition, we took the novel step of including a bioregulatory function of the bladder to acknowledge the roles of the bladder lining and urine composition in bladder health and dysfunction. ''Bladder Health'' and ''Bladder Dysfunction'' definitions were proposed for each bladder function: storage, emptying, and bioregulatory. The definitions took into account the known variation across the life course (e.g. development of continence in children is reliant on bladder maturation and appropriate neurodevelopmental function, while storage capacity and emptying efficiency may change with advanced age).\nAn iterative process was used to develop and refine terminology and the proposed definitions for health and dysfunction. Beginning in September 2015, PLUS TCFM members engaged in biweekly organized web-based discussions about definition development. Based on expertise, investigators were assigned to subgroups to advance work on each element of bladder function pertaining to the definition. Clinical experts shared existing knowledge of LUTS, while other experts broadened that knowledge to improve understanding for nonclinical audiences. To obtain input and refine the emerging definition, the TCFM investigators regularly shared progress with and received input from the entire PLUS Consortium through webinars and during in-person PLUS meetings. In addition, during in-person meetings, TCFM members led small group activities for all PLUS investigators to identify gaps in the definition and assess areas of uncertainty. By July 2017, the PLUS Consortium achieved consensus and approved the definitions for the elements of bladder function for use in development of a bladder health measurement questionnaire.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The PLUS definition of bladder health", "text": "The working PLUS Definition of Bladder Health is as follows:  Function does not impact daily activities on a routine basis, is adaptable to short term physical or environmental stressors, and allows a woman to pursue her optimal well-being (e.g. travel, exercise, social, occupational or other activities). LUTS, lower urinary tract symptoms; NA, not applicable.\n''A complete state of physical, mental, and social wellbeing related to bladder function and not merely the absence of LUTS. Healthy bladder function permits daily activities, adapts to short-term physical or environmental stressors, and allows optimal well-being (e.g., travel, exercise, social, occupational, or other activities).'' Underlying this overall definition, PLUS developed definitions for each of the three functions of the bladder (Table 1). The storage function of the bladder requires that the bladder acts as a low-pressure reservoir with a competent urethra that maintains pressure against increased abdominal pressure and communicates the state of bladder fullness via an intact nervous system. The defined elements of storage include: capacity (as measured by frequency of urination and storage volume), continence, and sensation (including comfort and urge). The emptying function of the bladder requires a sustained bladder contraction with relaxation of the urethra until urine is emptied completely, with an intact nervous system to communicate the state of bladder emptiness. The defined elements of emptying include: stream initiation, stream flow characteristics, efficacy of urination, and sensation (i.e., relief of urge, completeness, and comfort). We acknowledged that the elements of storage and emptying functions may be different during daytime (waking) and nighttime (sleeping) hours, which are reflected in the symptoms of dysfunction as defined by current International Continence Society (ICS) and International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) terminology. 40,[49][50][51][52][53] For each element of storage and emptying we identified subjective experience and objective features of bladder function and dysfunction (Table 1).\nDuring development of these definitions, PLUS investigators acknowledged that the proposed categorization of bladder functions differs slightly from previously described bladder phases of storage, emptying, and postmicturition. 42,54,55 In health, we did not consider ''postmicturition'' as a bladder function; rather we acknowledged it as a time interval whereby dysfunction in emptying or storage could occur. The healthy bladder should transition from emptying to storage without a defined ''postmicturition'' health state. In contrast, postvoid dribble is a LUTS that can be manifest in either storage or emptying dysfunctions. To acknowledge that postvoid dribble is likely a multifactorial condition, we present this dysfunction in both storage and emptying dysfunction.\nThe bladder bioregulatory function focuses more broadly on lower urinary tract dysfunction. Bioregulation was considered as bidirectional communication between the bladder and the environment that prevents systemic or local infection, transmits appropriate physiologic signals, or regulates cellular function. In health, the bladder barrier protects the individual from pathogens, chemicals, and malignancy; it is adaptable to shortterm physical, psychosocial, or environmental stressors; and it is able to recover from disruption without long-term or persistent sequela. A breakdown of the protective barrier may lead to infection, inflammation, malignancy, or other maladies. The bioregulatory function is subdivided into three main functions as follows: (1) Biosis barrier (representing the host-defense system), (2) physical/chemical barrier (preventing toxins from penetrating beyond the mucosal layer), and (3) cancer barrier (preventing malignant expression of bladder tissues). These functions include many biomarkers and ''-nomics'' (e.g. genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) related to lower uri-nary tract dysfunction. The list is intended to acknowledge the breadth of markers being studied, rather than serving as an exhaustive list that represents all known mechanisms for LUTS or bladder health. Biological markers of this sort may be identified in the healthy bladder, and they will be considered when measuring bladder health and outcomes in prevention studies.\nThe PLUS Consortium bladder health and dysfunction working table serves as a repository of working terminology and as a resource to help develop an instrument to measure bladder health, identify gaps in knowledge regarding health and dysfunction, and highlight areas for future bladder health research.

The importance of community engagement, with broad stakeholders, is essential to this effort, and key stakeholders will provide input to further evolve the PLUS bladder health definition.

This article explores the key elements of a fully functional MMRC and describes a recent multisector ini-tiative to build United States' capacity to review and prevent maternal deaths.\nMMRCs use vital records data and medical and social service records to understand the factors that influence maternal deaths. 2,3 It is from MMRCs that we have learned that roughly half of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States are preventable. [4][5][6] In addition to assessing preventability, MMRCs are able to make jurisdiction-specific recommendations and promote strategies to prevent future deaths. Examples of data-driven actions from MMRCs include: the development of urgent bulletins to providers on the dangers of placental disorders and peripartum cardiomyopathy (Florida) 7,8 collaborative efforts to increase knowledge of maternal deaths related to substance use and suicide, and to address gaps in services for women related to mental health and substance use (Michigan, West Virginia) obstetric emergency simulation trainings to prepare hospitals to address hemorrhage, cardiomyopathy, and preeclampsia (Ohio) MMRCs can also mobilize actions with outside sectors. For example, a partnership with the division of highway traffic safety led to the placement of a traffic light and crosswalk at a point in the road that was the site of at least two maternal deaths (New Jersey).\nRecognition of the critical role that MMRCs serve in identifying opportunities to prevent maternal deaths has resulted in a rapid growth in the number of MMRCs in the U.S. MMRCs grew from *19 review committees in 2010 to *34 MMRCs in 2017. Ten additional states and cities, or jurisdictions, are in the process of establishing MMRCs. Further evidence of recent momentum is reflected by legislative support for implementing MMRCs in Hawaii,* Maine, { Mississippi, { Puerto Rico, x South Carolina,** Tennessee, {{ and Washington {{ in 2016 and 2017. A focus on maternal health and safety by the Joint Commission and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau has also contributed to the national momentum for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. 9,10 ", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Barriers to Success for MMRCs", "text": "Although the number of MMRCs that exist has increased over the last several years, both newly formed and longestablished MMRCs struggle to achieve and sustain progress toward reviewing and preventing deaths. In 2012, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health assessed U.S. capacity to conduct maternal mortality review. States identified several common challenges, including lack of funding, difficulty accessing medical records and other data sources, lack of standard data entry systems, and limited opportunities for networking with their peers in other jurisdictions. 4 In response to the challenges identified in the 2012 assessment, the CDC, CDC Foundation, and AMCHP partnered to launch the Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths initiative in December of 2015. The initiative is funded through an agreement with Merck on behalf of its Merck for Mothers Program, and addresses major barriers that MMRCs face in achieving full functionality and sustainability.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Defining Fully Functional MMRCs", "text": "The Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths Initiative Team met with MMRC staff and stakeholders from 23 states and 1 city to define criteria of fully functional MMRCs. Stakeholders identified a fully functional MMRC as one that achieves the following:\nRobust, accurate data that informs policy, process, clinical care, and public health Strategic, data-driven actions that guide prevention programs and policies to strengthen systems and improve quality of care Improvements in maternal outcomes demonstrated by reductions in maternal mortality and morbidity Stakeholders also stated that the ideal MMRC would accomplish the following: Review deaths less than 1 year after they occurred Allot adequate time to preparing detailed recommendations during committee meetings Connect with state perinatal quality collaboratives or other groups to ensure recommendations are implemented After defining a fully functional MMRC, the Initiative Team partnered with a CDC Evaluation Fellow. The evaluation fellow met with stakeholders from eight MMRCs across the country to develop an accompanying logic model (Fig. 1). Although MMRCs differ from state to state, the logic model is designed to represent the general inputs, activities, and outcomes of an ideal, fully functional MMRC. The logic model can serve as a starting point, and is adaptable to the context of individual state or city-based MMRCs.\nEach column in the logic model might be thought of as a series of steps that will make it possible to reach the next column to the right. Inputs are the tangible and intangible things that should already be in place for an MMRC to successfully complete its Activities. Activities are the actions that an MMRC engages in, and might also include anything from the Input column that is not already present in an MMRC's state or jurisdiction. Outputs are the products of an MMRC's activities. Inputs, Activities, and Outputs are all things that an MMRC program has some level of direct control over, and together they make up the program's Process. While Outcomes cannot be directly controlled by an MMRC, the MMRC can influence the outcomes with its Activities. In this logic model, the Outputs and Short-term Outcomes columns are joined by the condition: ''MMRC recommendations are part of a cycle of continuous quality improvement for health systems.'' This is a necessary condition for MMRCs to span the gap between Process and Outcomes.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Increasing Inputs and Removing Barriers to Fully Functional MMRCs in the United States", "text": "Since December 2015, the Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths initiative has aided both newly forming and existing MMRCs to overcome barriers, establish inputs, and sustain the activities and outputs necessary to achieving their desired outcomes.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Increasing inputs", "text": "Critical Inputs of a fully functional MMRC are proper authority to access data and review records and protections to operate. To assist MMRCs that request assistance in this area, the Initiative Team worked with partners at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop an Authorities and Protections Checklist. 11 The checklist covers the key components that jurisdictions should consider, including the authority to access data, confidentiality and protection for data and activities, and immunity from subpoena for committee members. Leadership engagement and stakeholder commitment is another critical Input to a fully functional MMRC. Broad representation in committee membership, including public health, obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, nursing, midwifery, forensic pathology, mental health, and behavioral health. Members might also include social workers, patient advocates, and other relevant multidisciplinary stakeholders. To promote an understanding of MMRCs among stakeholders, the Initiative Team developed a short motion graphic video to explain the value of MMRCs and the process of establishing an MMRC. 12 The video is available online at the www.ReviewtoAction.org website. The Review to Action website was implemented by the Initiative Team to promote the maternal mortality review process and to provide resources and tools that support MMRCs.\nDefined scope and explicit protocols are also necessary Inputs. The Initiative Team developed a Committee Facilitation Guide that includes model scope, protocols, and processes that can be adapted or replicated by MMRCs as they develop their Inputs. 13 An interactive online mock MMRC case review experience will soon be available that will guide individuals who are seeking to implement or improve review committee processes.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Removing barriers", "text": "In the 2012 assessment, several states identified the need for a standard data system that supports the critical Inputs of consistent case abstraction, case review data, and data analysis within an MMRC over time and across MMRCs. In response, the Initiative Team created the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA), a data system that allows MMRCs across the country to abstract relevant data from a variety of sources, document committee decisions, and analyze data. The system also allows for sharing of data across MMRCs. MMRIA builds on lessons learned from implementing its precursor, the Maternal Mortality Review Data System (MMRDS) in 12 states between 2012 and 2016. MMRIA improves upon MMRDS by capturing increased detail on mental health conditions as contributors to maternal deaths and generates quick reports to provide committee members with an on-demand overview of their findings. The system includes 12 ''forms'' with defined variables that follow the flow of a typical review: As a comprehensive data system that touches almost all aspects of review committee processes and outcomes, MMRIA is the backbone of the Initiative Team's technical assistance to MMRCs. The Team also developed tools to accompany MMRIA that support MMRC Activities. In consultation with MMRC expert abstractors, the Initiative Team developed an Abstractor Manual to support both distance-based learning and in-person trainings for MMRC abstractors across the country, promoting consistent data abstraction and, just as importantly, implementation of best practices for effective and efficient abstraction. 14 The Committee Decisions Form guides MMRCs in making the following key decisions for each death reviewed. Committees are encouraged to distribute a paper version that is formatted for use during meetings. 15 1. Was the death pregnancy related? (A death is considered pregnancy related if the committee determines the death occurred during pregnancy or within 1 year of the end of pregnancy from a pregnancy complication, a chain of events initiated by pregnancy, or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of pregnancy.) 2. What was the underlying cause of death? 3. Was the death preventable? (A death is considered preventable if the committee determines that there was at least some chance of the death being averted by one or more reasonable changes to patient, family, provider, facility, system, and/or community factors.) 4. What were the contributing factors to the death? 5. What are the recommendations and actions that address those contributing factors? 6. What is the anticipated impact of those actions if implemented?\nFIG. 1.\nDemonstrating the feasibility and utility of sharing data across MMRCs, the Initiative Team collaborated with four MMRCs that voluntarily implemented MMRDS to publish the Report from MMRCs: A View Into Their Critical Role. 16 The report provides the first in-depth examination of pregnancyrelated deaths from standardized data across multiple MMRCs. The report demonstrates the potential for identifying key factors contributing to maternal deaths that impact multiple jurisdictions and opportunities for prevention using a common language for MMRCs to work together. For example, this report documents that mental health conditions were a leading cause of pregnancy-related death among the four participating states. This finding could not be identified by other national surveillance systems of maternal deaths because of their reliance on vital records data alone, which does not provide the level of detail necessary to determine the influence of mental health conditions. The report also showed that causes of pregnancy-related death differ by age of mother and timing of death (e.g., while pregnant, during, or shortly after delivery up to 42 days, or in the late postpartum period of 43-to 365 days). The report offers evidence that a maternal death is most often the tragic result of a number of contributing factors, and points to the need for collaborative actions by multidisciplinary stakeholders. The report also introduced the use of sociospatial data to highlight systemlevel and community-level contributing factors to maternal deaths (e.g., lack of access to reliable transportation, affordable groceries, and public spaces for recreation and fitness; lack of access to primary care, mental health providers, and obstetricians/gynecologists).\nBy the end of the Initiative's first 18 months, 13 jurisdictions were using MMRIA and an additional 10 were in the process of adopting it. As more states implement MMRIA, clinical and public health practitioners will have enhanced ability to identify causes and contributing factors to maternal deaths. In addition, they will be able to identify and implement data-driven prevention strategies with the greatest potential impacts both within and across jurisdictions.\nAnother significant barrier identified by MMRCs in the 2012 assessment is the lack of opportunity to network with other MMRCS. The Initiative Team held two regional trainings in 2016, focused on providing an overview of MMRC processes and the data system. The first training brought together MMRC stakeholders from seven western states (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Washington) and a representative of the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission. The second training brought together seven jurisdictions from the mid-Atlantic region (Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York City, Virginia, and West Virginia). These regional trainings provided opportunities for shared learning and fostered collaborative activities among neighboring jurisdictions.\nThe first MMRIA User Meeting in Atlanta, GA served as an opportunity for national networking. More than 50 abstractors and data analysts from 24 jurisdictions attended trainings specific to their MMRC role, that is, abstractor or data analyst. As with the regional trainings, the MMRIA User Meeting facilitated both formal and informal sharing and networking across MMRCs.\nOngoing opportunities for information sharing and networking are available through the Review to Action website (www.ReviewtoAction.org).

In 2014, approximately 81.60% of non-Hispanic (NH) white women initiated PNC during the first trimester, compared to 65.90% of NH black women and 71.7% of Hispanic women. 1 NH black and Hispanic women are also less likely to have adequate PNC relative to their NH white counterparts. 2,3 These racial/ethnic disparities in PNC have important implications for disparities in maternal and child health. While there is evidence that the effects of PNC on birth outcomes are equivocal, 4 PNC arguably plays an important role in managing pregnancy complications among higherrisk mothers and encouraging healthy lifestyle choices such as smoking cessation. 4,5 Further, a growing literature has shown that PNC has important impacts on maternal health, parenting behaviors, and subsequent pregnancy outcomes. [6][7][8] Thus, identifying the factors driving PNC disparities can reduce race/ethnicity-based health inequalities beyond those directly related to the current pregnancy.\nPrior studies have identified a diverse array of individual-, household-and area-level factors associated with access to care during pregnancy. 2,[9][10][11] However, the contributions of each of these factors on PNC disparities are not readily obvious. For example, although privately insured women have higher rates of adequate PNC than mothers with public insurance coverage, 2,12 racial/ethnic disparities in PNC use are larger among the privately insured than among the publicly insured. 2 Similarly, while a lower level of physician availability is associated with delays in PNC initiation, 10,11 NH black women, who are more likely to live in areas with greater physician availability, are less likely to initiate timely PNC relative to NH whites. 13 Most extant research is limited in its ability to identify the most important mechanisms underlying PNC disparities for two reasons. First, many studies have been hampered by limited information on theoretically important characteristics (e.g., the availability of transportation 9 ) that can significantly influence access to care. Second, no studies have systematically measured the individual and collective contributions of these factors to racial/ethnic disparities in PNC use.\nThis study addresses these existing knowledge gaps by quantifying the contributions of individual-, household-, and area-level factors to racial/ethnic disparities in PNC use among NH white, NH black, and Hispanic mothers. I apply wellestablished decomposition methods to nationally representative survey data containing information on a wide array of individual-, household-, and area-level characteristics.

The ECLS-B followed the same cohort of children from birth through kindergarten, collecting data when children were 9 months old, 2 years old, 4 years old, and in kindergarten. The survey sample, drawn from Vital Statistics birth records, contains oversamples of Asian and Pacific Islander children, Chinese children, and American Indian children, as well as multiple births and low and very low birth weight infants. The ECLS-B is one of the most recent nationally representative surveys containing detailed information on maternal socioeconomic status (SES), PNC use, and maternal county of residence at birth. I derived all county-level (U.S. Census) data from the Area Resource Files (ARF) 14 and Social Explorer. 15 In Wave 1, the ECLS-B sample contained information on approximately 10,700 births. (Restricted data reporting guidelines require rounding all sample sizes to the nearest 50.) For this study, the original eligible sample consisted of all NH white, NH black, and Hispanic mothers born in the United States who were interviewed during the first survey wave and gave birth to one child (N & 5,500). (Note: Throughout the remaining text, ''white'' refers to non-Hispanic white and ''black'' refers to non-Hispanic black.) Multiple pregnancies were excluded because they generally require more intensive PNC than singleton pregnancies. 16 Similarly, I excluded immigrant mothers because the extent to which specific characteristics contribute to disparities in healthcare use often varies widely by nativity. 17 Finally, the study focused on white, black, and Hispanic women because the sample sizes for women from other ethnic groups were too small to yield robust estimates. (I excluded less than 50 women due to missing information on race/ethnicity and/or immigrant status.) From the study sample of approximately 5,500 mothers who met the eligibility criteria, I excluded women with missing information on PNC use (n & 200) or insurance (n & 100). Fewer than 50 observations were excluded due to missing information on SES, preconception health behaviors, or location of PNC.

PNC is a good that indirectly contributes to mothers' utility (or satisfaction) via its ability to improve pregnancy outcomes. Mothers' demand for PNC is based on prior maternal health, economic resources, environmental factors, and tastes and preferences. 8 The outcomes of interest included binary measures of whether a mother initiated PNC during the first trimester of pregnancy (before 13 weeks gestation) and whether she received adequate PNC. Following the Kotelchuck index, mothers were categorized as having adequate or better than adequate PNC use if they reported attending at least 80% of recommended visits.\nFollowing prior research, 13,18 I included theoretically relevant variables in the models, including maternal health and pregnancy characteristics, preconception health behaviors, insurance coverage, location of PNC, SES, and county-level social/economic and healthcare environments. Maternal health and pregnancy characteristics included maternal age, prior experience of a preterm birth, and whether this was the mother's first live birth. Maternal age is associated with greater PNC use, in part because older women are more likely to have pregnancy complications. 19 Mothers who have experienced prior adverse birth outcomes may require more intensive and regular healthcare. 20 First-time mothers are also more likely to initiate care and have adequate visits than women with more than one child. 9,21 Preconception health behaviors can serve as important proxies for maternal attitudes toward healthcare and health. For example, mothers who smoke before or during pregnancy are less likely to initiate first-trimester PNC. 22 Each model included three preconception health behaviors (measured 3 months before pregnancy): smoking status, consumption of 4 or more alcoholic drinks per week, and taking vitamins at least three times per week.\nInsurance coverage affects the affordability of and access to healthcare. 23 Each model included an indicator for public insurance (Medicaid), private (only) insurance, or no insurance coverage. Location-based differences in quality of care 24 might influence compliance with recommended visitation schedules. Measures of PNC care location included visits to a private doctor, public health clinic, or other facility.\nSES included measures of maternal educational attainment, marital status, employment, WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children) participation, household income, number of individuals in the household, home ownership, and car ownership. Education is associated with higher earnings and better employment, enabling women to more easily afford healthcare. Educated mothers are also more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, including timely PNC initiation. 25 Similarly, mothers who are married, employed, and have higher levels of household income/wealth are better positioned to devote resources to healthcare during pregnancy. 26 Lack of transportation can also be an important barrier to PNC use. 9 Finally, measures of the county-level social/economic environment included the percentage of individuals from the mother's racial/ethnic group, percentage of individuals with income below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL), percentage of the population living in urban areas, county size, and geographic region. The percentage of individuals in the mother's racial/ethnic group and poverty are proxies for reduced access to resources during pregnancy. 27,28 Urbanicity, county size, and region served as indicators of geographic variation in access to care. 13 The number of obstetriciangynecologists per 1,000 residents, which is an indicator of healthcare availability, 10,13 served as the measure of the healthcare environment. I extracted data on racial composition, urbanicity, and number of obstetrician-gynecologists from the 2000 ARF and poverty data from Social Explorer.\nInformation on county size and geographic region was located within the ECLS-B data files.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "I first compared differences in characteristics between white, black, and Hispanic mothers using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. For the main analyses, I used a variant of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. This methodological approach builds upon multivariate regression analyses to explicitly quantify the contribution of differences in explanatory variables to disparities in dependent variables. The method has gained increasing traction among researchers investigating health disparities. 13,18 In addition, this study employed the Fairlie extension, an approach developed specifically to apply Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods to nonlinear outcomes. 29 I first estimated pooled logit models for the full sample, including indicator variables for race/ethnicity. 30 Each observation from the white subsample was subsequently matched to an observation from the minority (black or Hispanic) subsample to calculate the contributions of individual variables or groups of variables to disparities in PNC use. Because whites comprised the largest racial/ethnic group, I performed random draws (with replacement) to create a oneto-one match between the white and minority subsamples. The probability of being chosen at random was proportional to the sampling probability weights. Next, for each independent variable (e.g., insurance), I calculated the change in the average predicted probability of the outcome (e.g., adequate PNC use) that would result from a switch from the white distribution to the black or Hispanic distribution of that variable; all other variable distributions were held constant. A similar approach was used to calculate the contribution of broad categories of variables, such as SES.\nOne potential limitation of nonlinear decomposition is that the order in which the independent variables enter the model can influence individual parameter estimates, although the total contribution of all explanatory variables remains unchanged. In addition, although the decomposition procedure relies on randomly chosen subsamples of whites and nonwhites, it is important that the results ultimately approximate those that would be obtained from matching the full sample of whites to the full sample of blacks (or Hispanics). To address these concerns, I followed prior work and randomized the order of variable entry over 2,000 replications 18 ; this approach yields an average decomposition result for individual variables/categories while preserving the summative properties of the model.

White mothers had the highest rates of early PNC initiation (89.63%) while blacks and Hispanics had the lowest rates (74.81% and 78.56% respectively). Similarly, whites had much higher rates of adequate PNC (78.62%) than black and Hispanic mothers (69.04% and 68.02%, respectively).\nWhite and non-white mothers differed significantly with respect to the distributions of individual characteristics. Black and Hispanic mothers were generally younger than white mothers, but all three groups had similar rates of firsttime motherhood and prior preterm births. Black mothers had the lowest rate of preconception smoking (19.28%) followed by Hispanics and whites (22.63% and 30.78%, respectively). However, black mothers also had the lowest rates of regular preconception vitamin use. Black and Hispanic women had higher rates of Medicaid coverage (65.34% and 39.55%, respectively) than white women (24.53%). In addition, blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to receive PNC at a public clinic.\nWhite mothers were more socioeconomically advantaged than non-white mothers in the sample. Marital rates were highest among white mothers (78.10%) and lowest among black mothers (28.84%). Relative to non-white mothers, white mothers were comparatively more educated, had higher incomes, and had relatively higher rates of home and car ownership. Finally, there were also racial/ethnic differences in the social/economic and healthcare environments of respondents. Compared to white mothers, black and Hispanic mothers lived in counties that were slightly poorer, more urban, and more densely populated, and where they did not comprise the majority ethnic group. Relative to white and Hispanic mothers, black mothers lived in areas with higher densities of obstetrician-gynecologists.\nTables 2 and 3 display the results of the Fairlie decomposition models of racial disparities in early PNC initiation and adequacy, respectively.

The findings suggest that maternal SES is a primary driver of racial/ethnic gaps in both PNC initiation and PNC adequacy. The location of care was also associated with both outcomes, although to a lesser extent. Differences in insurance and maternal health and pregnancy characteristics were associated with disparities in PNC initiation, but failed to explain disparities in PNC adequacy. Maternal preconception behaviors were not significantly associated with either PNC initiation or adequacy. Finally, with one exception (the blackwhite disparity in adequacy), there was limited evidence that differences in social/economic or healthcare environments at either the county or state levels contributed to PNC-related disparities. Taken together, the models explained 61.20%-79.90% of the disparity in PNC initiation and 52.15%-79.09% of the disparity in PNC adequacy.\nGiven the large racial/ethnic gaps in SES in the study sample, it is unsurprising that SES-related factors explained the majority of PNC disparities. The importance of SES to racial/ethnic disparities in PNC use is consistent with prior work 13,18 showing that mothers with higher levels of education and economic resources are better positioned to devote resources to healthcare during pregnancy. 26 The findings here suggest that broader policies that target upstream factors such as income, home ownership, and educational attainment may help to achieve racial/ethnic equality in PNC use. For example, one study    examined the impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a refundable transfer to low-income families on birth outcomes. The authors found that among single, low-educated mothers, a $1,000 increase resulted in a 1.60%-2.90% decline in low birth weight; increases in PNC use were one important mechanism. 31 Moreover, improvements in birth outcomes were largest among NH black mothers. Another recent study found that increases in the minimum wage were associated with improvements in birth outcomes, possibly due to increased PNC use. 32 However, some socioeconomic indicators were more relevant to PNC adequacy than PNC initiation. WIC participation was one such example. Financial need may remain an important obstacle to obtaining adequate PNC among lowincome women. 33 Because WIC augments household income via food vouchers, the program might play an important role in mitigating financial barriers to consistent PNC use. The current findings cannot be interpreted as causal, particularly given that the ECLS-B data do not contain information on WIC eligibility. However, they provide suggestive evidence that increasing WIC use among black and Hispanic mothers might narrow racial/ethnic gaps in PNC adequacy.\nBoth maternal health and pregnancy characteristics and insurance coverage influenced disparities in PNC initiation, but not disparities in PNC adequacy. Minority women, who are more likely to have Medicaid coverage, might be more likely to delay care because of the bureaucratic challenges involved with obtaining public insurance. Addressing these administrative obstacles may help to improve disparities in initiation. However, average PNC expenditures are significantly higher among the privately insured than among those on Medicaid. 34 This expenditure gap might explain why insurance is unrelated to PNC adequacy (e.g., the number of visits). Similarly, while older and first-time mothers might be more likely to initiate first-trimester PNC due to initial concerns about pregnancy risks, these factors (age and parity) might not be as salient once providers have provided reassurance about pregnancy health.\nThe location of PNC care was significantly associated with a small proportion of the gaps in both PNC initiation and adequacy. Prior research has found that unsatisfying clinical experiences and perceived insensitivity among public clinic staff were important factors leading minority women to delay PNC initiation. 35,36 However, randomized trials have shown that, relative to receiving traditional PNC, receiving groupbased PNC (a form of care in which providers see women both individually and in groups) improved patient-provider relationships and patient satisfaction among low-income black women receiving care at public clinics. 37 This study was unable to identify the type of PNC that each woman received (group or traditional); however, adopting group PNC might address location-based barriers to PNC use.\nWith few exceptions, the social/economic, healthcare, and state environments had little impact on disparities in PNC use. In a similar vein, prior work using Vital Statistics data have found small to no effects of most county-level characteristics on birth outcomes. 13 Variation across smaller geographic areas (e.g., census tracts) might be more relevant to women's healthcare use. The one exception to this overall pattern is modest evidence that differences in the density of obstetriciangynecologists and state-level environments mitigate the blackwhite gap in PNC adequacy. This result is unsurprising given that black women are less likely than white women to live in rural areas that have poor access to healthcare. States vary widely with respect to access to social services and PNC coverage (e.g., income eligibility cutoffs for prenatal Medicaid) 23 ; these differences also likely impact access to care.\nFinally, the model explained less of the Hispanic-white gaps than the black-white gaps, primarily because SES explained relatively less of the white-Hispanic disparities. The relative influence of SES might be smaller among Hispanics because the white-Hispanic gaps in several of the key SES variables (e.g., income and marital status) were narrower than the corresponding white-black gaps. Future work should identify more salient characteristics that drive white-Hispanic disparities in PNC use.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations and Strengths", "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the outcomes of interest were based on maternal self-reports and thus were subject to recall bias. However, to my knowledge, there is no existing evidence that maternal recollection of PNC initiation or number of visits varies by race/ethnicity. Second, there was a lack of information on factors that earlier research has identified as salient to PNC use, including social support, attitudes toward healthcare, and the quality of interactions between patients and clinical staff. 9,21 However, the models included other measures (marital status, preconception health behaviors, and location of care) that may have captured some information on these omitted characteristics. Similarly, this study was unable to measure several common preconception risk factors (e.g., oral infections and obesity) that often lead to classifying patients as high risk (thereby affecting the probability of receiving adequate care). Third, the relationships that emerged in the models cannot be interpreted as causal. Finally, although the models were able to explain much of the racial/ethnic variation in PNC, unexplained gaps remained, particularly between white and Hispanic mothers.\nDespite these limitations, this study has several important strengths. The richly detailed data enabled the measurement of key SES variables often unavailable in similar studies.

Finally, extending this empirical method to quantify the causal impacts of policy changes on racial/ethnic gaps in PNC and infant health outcomes would provide particularly helpful insights for decision makers interested in understanding the impacts of proposed policies on health equity.

Research in larger more diverse populations with attention to adherence is needed to inform clinical practice recommendations. We examined the impact of group prenatal care on preterm birth and low birth weight in a large metropolitan hospital, accounting for patient adherence, over an 8.5-year period. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from 9,348 pregnant women with a live, singleton birth who received group (CenteringPregnancy or Expect With Me) or individual prenatal care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from January 2009 through June 2016. Propensity scores were used for matching based on year of delivery, age, race, pregnancy risk, and adequacy of care. The propensity score matched sample included 1,384 group and 5,055 individual prenatal care patients (total = 6,439 women). Preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (<2,500 g) were obtained from systematic medical review. Risks were estimated using Poisson regression. Results: Controlling for individual visits, receiving group prenatal care resulted in significantly lower risk of having a preterm birth (Rate ratio [RR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.81) and low birth weight baby (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81), compared to receiving individual care only. Women with \u20215 group prenatal care visits experienced even greater benefits: 68% (RR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.22-0.45) and 66% (RR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.23-0.50) risk reduction in preterm birth and low birth weight, respectively.

Several randomized controlled trials and matched cohort studies demonstrate that group prenatal care-a patient-centered model that integrates components of individual prenatal care (e.g., physical examination and patient education) with group-based discussion, interactive skill building, self-care, and social support 2 -improves perinatal outcomes compared to traditional individual care. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] However, two recent meta-analyses found that results for preterm birth were equivocal and may best apply to high risk subsamples, such as African American women. 11,12 Limitations of previous studies include the use of clinical sites naive to group prenatal care and lack of attention to patient adherence. Initial adoption challenges may complicate an evaluation of comparative effectiveness. Attendance at more group visits is associated with better perinatal outcomes, 4 but group prenatal care is routinely complemented by individual visits (e.g., missed appointments and issues requiring private examinations). 13 Barriers to patient adherence may include scheduling conflicts, lack of transportation or child care, or privacy concerns. 14,15 Once group session dates and times are set, they typically cannot be changed, which may be problematic for women with limited control over their daily schedules. Studies involving larger more diverse samples from established implementation sites, with attention to adherence, are needed to inform clinical practice recommendations.\nWe assessed the impact of two group prenatal care programs implemented successively over a period of 8.5 years in a large metropolitan hospital that serves a diverse population.

To avoid withinperson correlation, we included only the first birth that occurred during the study period for each woman.

Described in detail elsewhere, 2,16 each model has a unique curriculum; however, both follow guidelines from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for recommended content and schedule of prenatal care. For both models, groups are led by a licensed healthcare provider (obstetrician or midwife) and assistant. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, group prenatal care sessions are led by certified nurse midwives and medical faculty. Residents and medical students participate as co-facilitators, when possible, during their rotations on service. Following individual intake, all prenatal care occurs within the group setting, except for visits requiring private consultation (e.g., late-pregnancy cervical assessments). Groups include 8-12 women of similar gestational age. Depending on gestational age at enrollment and delivery, women participate in up to 10 group sessions of 120 minutes each. During group care, providers conduct individual clinical assessments (e.g., fundal height and heart rate monitoring), women practice selfcare skills (e.g., weighing themselves and taking own blood pressure), and group members participate in facilitated discussions on healthy pregnancy, birth, and parenting. Expect With Me patients additionally have access to a novel information technology platform designed to improve patient engagement and support, improve health behaviors and decision-making skills, connect providers and patients, and enhance health service delivery. 16 Vanderbilt University Medical Center transitioned from using CenteringPregnancy to Expect With Me in 2013. There were no other changes to the prenatal care delivery practice pattern during the study period.\nThe cohorts of women receiving CenteringPregnancy and Expect With Me group prenatal care were combined as they share the same structure and underlying philosophy. The timing of sessions and core content of prenatal care are the same. Each model has a unique curriculum. However, previous research has demonstrated that fidelity to the process of group prenatal care (i.e., patient engagement and facilitative leadership), rather than fidelity to session content, may drive the observed reductions in preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes. 17 Expect With Me includes a technology platform that serves to facilitate model implementation and reinforces the social relationships and learning that happen in groups.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Measures", "text": "Primary outcomes were preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (infants <2,500 g).

A pregnant woman seeking prenatal care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center is likely to be seen by a maternal fetal medicine specialist two or more times if she is deemed to have a complex maternal medical condition, obstetric complication, or fetal condition that requires intermittent assessment and management. These conditions can include, but are not limited to, anticipated birth defects, multiple gestations, preexisting diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, infection diseases or kidney diseases, or history of preterm delivery. A minimum of two maternal-fetal medicine visits was selected as a proxy for higher pregnancy risk since there are instances where women may receive a referral but the condition that prompted the initial visit does not require ongoing specialty care. 19 Adequacy of care, which encompasses both the timing of the initial and total number of prenatal care visits, was included to ensure that comparisons between the study groups reflected the type of care received as opposed to amount. 18 Number of individual prenatal care visits attended was included in adjusted models (categorized as 0-1, 2-9, and 10+ visits).", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Propensity score matching", "text": "Randomization was not possible in this observational study of routine clinical practice; therefore, propensity score matching was conducted to reduce bias in estimating treatment effects. 20 Propensity score matching provides a rigorous approach for comparing treatment groups, matching on observable characteristics believed to be related to the exposure of interest or that which are confounders. 21,22 Propensity score matching enables creation of study groups that are similar and, in turn, more accurate assessment of the relationship between treatment and outcome than direct comparisons of two potentially disparate groups. This method has been used recently in studies of maternal and child health outcomes (e.g., use of antidepressants in pregnancy 23 and screening by echocardiography among extremely preterm infants 24 ).\nWe generated a greedy-matched sample of women who received any group prenatal care versus individual prenatal care only using propensity scores based on year of delivery, age, race, pregnancy risk, and adequacy of care. In greedy matching, a group prenatal care subject is first selected at random. An individual prenatal care subject whose propensity score is closest to that of this randomly selected group prenatal care subject is then chosen as a match. Each group prenatal care patient was matched with up to four individual care patients using a caliper of 0.25 standard deviations of the logit of the propensity score, without replacement.

In addition, women who joined the study at later gestational ages were more likely to receive fewer group/individual care sessions compared to women who joined the study at earlier gestational ages. To account for this variation in duration of prenatal care, we used Poisson regression models to compare rates of preterm birth and low birth weight among group care patients versus those who did not receive any group care. Poisson regression models are generalized linear models that account for the observation time per person (in this case duration of prenatal care in days from first visit to delivery), thus allowing estimation of incidence rate ratios (RRs). 25 The regression models were adjusted for number of individual care visits (i.e., we included a variable that classified the women according to the number of individual visits they attended). Following previous research, 4 we conducted a post hoc subgroup analyses to evaluate the impact of receiving five or more group care visits versus individual care only, as well as five or more group versus five or more individual care visits.

The final analytic sample included 5,055 exclusive individual prenatal care patients and 1,384 group prenatal care patients. Group prenatal care patients attended an average of 6.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 2.6) group sessions and 3.4 (SD = 2.5) individual visits. Individual care only patients had a mean of 9.1 (SD = 2.4) prenatal visits.\nThe overall cumulative incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight among the propensity matched sample was 7.4% and 6.7%, respectively. Table 2 presents results of the Pois-son regression models comparing rates of preterm birth and low birth weight for group prenatal care versus those with individual care only. Adjusting for number of individual visits, group prenatal care patients had significantly lower risk of having a preterm (RR 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.81) or low birth weight (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81) baby than those who received no group prenatal care. Adjusting for the number of individual visits, the rates of preterm birth were 1.75% and 8.56%, and the rates of low birth weight were 1.21% and 7.17% for group prenatal care and individual care only, respectively.\nApproximately, 77.6% women participating in group care attended at least 50% of recommended group prenatal care visits (5 out of 10). Post hoc subgroup analyses demonstrate that women who attended at least 50% of recommended group visits experienced even greater risk reductions in adverse birth outcomes. Compared to individual care only patients, risk of preterm birth and low birth weight among women who attended five or more group prenatal care sessions decreased by 68% (RR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.22-0.45) and  66% (RR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.23-0.50), respectively. In addition, we observed a lower risk of preterm birth and low birth weight among women who attended five or more group care sessions compared to women who attended five or more individual care only visits, (RR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.72) and (RR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.38-0.72), respectively. Finally, the results of post hoc analyses stratified by type of group prenatal care revealed that, compared to individual care, women who received Expect With Me experienced a 49% (RR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.33-0.76) reduction and those who received CenteringPregnancy a 32% (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.88) reduction in risk of preterm birth. Likewise, Expect With Me was associated with a 51% (RR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.30-0.79) reduction and CenteringPregnancy a 33% (RR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.51-0.89) reduction in low birth weight. Differences in the magnitude of these reductions should be interpreted with caution, as this study was not designed to compare group prenatal care models to one another. Results suggest that both Expect With Me and CenteringPregnancy were associated with reduced rates of preterm birth and low birth weight.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Among more than 9,000 pregnant women, we observed statistically and clinically meaningful risk reductions for both preterm delivery and low birth weight among women who attended any group care sessions. This study also demonstrates the importance of adherence. Specifically, attending five or more group prenatal care visits resulted in more than a two-thirds reduction in risk of having a preterm birth or low birth weight baby. Compared to women who attended five or more individual care only visits, those who attended five or more group sessions also experienced lower risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. It is possible that a minimum ''dose'' may be required to observe enhanced benefits of group relative to individual care, particularly if increased social support, which may take multiple meetings to establish the necessary trust to achieve, is one of the mechanisms through which the group dynamic positively influences birth outcomes. More than three-fourths of the pregnant women who started group prenatal care attended at least half of the recommended 10 group sessions.\nEffect sizes observed in the current study are comparable to those reported in previous studies. 10,11 This study examined women who received prenatal care at a large clinical site over an 8.5-year period. We included one of the largest study samples to date, and women were diverse regarding medical and social risk factors. Previous studies have included women who were predominantly young, minority, and low income. In addition, prior studies, and particularly those based on an intent-to-treat analytic approach, may have diluted the effect of group prenatal care on birth outcomes depending on treatment adherence. We accounted for heterogeneity in terms of amount of group versus individual prenatal care visits women attended. Women who carry to term are eligible to access more prenatal care than women who deliver preterm simply because they are pregnant longer. To address this, we included adequacy of care, based on the Revised-Graduated Prenatal Care Utilization Index which considers gestational age at first prenatal care visit and at delivery, as one of the variables used to create the propensity scores. 18 We also used Poisson regression models to account for variation in duration of care.\nTherefore, we conclude that any observed effects of group prenatal care are not the result of temporal confounding.\nGroup prenatal care will only achieve large-scale national impact on maternal and child health outcomes to the extent that it is adopted by patients and providers. Despite Vanderbilt University Medical Center's long-standing commitment to providing group prenatal care, only 15% of eligible patients participated. Inadequate systems for recruitment and retention can contribute to low group prenatal care enrollment. 26 Other challenges may include difficulties with securing adequate space, scheduling, and staffing. 27 Transitioning health systems to provide group prenatal care requires an organizational culture that supports innovation and substantial investment in terms of clinical space and provider and support staff time. 26,27 Paradoxically, although the healthcare delivery system bears the burden of transformation to provide group care, the beneficiary of cost savings is most often the payor. Recent studies of Medicaid payment models in South Carolina have incentivized providers to deliver group prenatal care and produced significant returns on investment for all stakeholders. 5,10 We acknowledge several study limitations. As with other cohort studies, we rely on matching techniques in our analysis because assignment to group care was not randomized, the gold standard for clinical research. Billing and medical record data contained limited sociodemographic and clinical information. Data were not available for other race categories, smoking history, or medical conditions (e.g., hypertension and diabetes). We were able to use number of maternal-fetal medicine visits as a proxy for a medically high-risk pregnancy, but were limited in our ability to control for potential social risk factors. Moreover, although women with complex maternal medical conditions, obstetric complications, or fetal anomalies may be more likely to have had two or more maternal-fetal medicine visits, not all high-risk pregnancies are identified before labor and delivery and some primary care providers may be more comfortable executing a care plan for certain conditions than others who may prefer the subspecialist to continue to follow the patient. We were also not able to differentiate between spontaneous versus iatrogenic preterm births.\nAlthough we account for heterogeneity arising from group prenatal care patients' mix of individual and group care visits, future studies should also examine patterns of individual care visits among group care patients, patient characteristics (e.g., sociodemographic factors, comorbid health conditions, stress, and anxiety) associated with supplemental individual care visits, and consequences of such visits on clinical sites' implementation of group care models. Finally, although this study includes women who received two different group prenatal care interventions, it was not designed to assess the comparative effectiveness of the two models. We believe them to be comparable, as they are both based on clinical guidelines established by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Although each uses a unique curriculum, previous research suggests that it is the group process (e.g., facilitation by provider leaders and social support provided by the group of women at a similar stage of pregnancy) and not content (e.g., specific curriculum) that drives observed differences in birth outcomes. 23 Despite substantial biomedical advances and intervention efforts, preterm and low birth weight deliveries persist, with serious consequences for infant, child, and adult health. The multifaceted supportive nature of group prenatal care provides mothers with holistic care during a time of stress and change, embedding them within a social network of peers, empowering them with knowledge and skills, and increasing their access to medical care throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Group prenatal care participation may result in improved birth outcomes and patients also report higher levels of care satisfaction, 3 both important components of valuebased healthcare. Health service innovations come with many implementation challenges, and more research is needed to better understand how group prenatal care may be positively influencing outcomes. Nonetheless, efforts to promote more widespread adoption and sustainability of group prenatal care, including innovative incentive strategies and enhanced reimbursement, are warranted.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This study was supported by a grant from UnitedHealth Foundation, with additional in-kind support from Uni-tedHealth Group.

They concluded that aspirin users among the study subjects were at a decreased risk for breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.94) and that a high cumulative dose of aspirin (>88,900 mg) was likely to reduce the risk of breast cancer (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67). However, we are concerned that these findings might be biased.\nIn the study of Yang et al., patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus from 1999 to 2001 were included in the cohort, and aspirin users were required to obtain prescriptions for lowdose aspirin within 2 years of their diabetes diagnosis. The authors stated that these patients were followed from the day of initiation of aspirin therapy, but there was no description of follow-up for aspirin nonusers. It is presumed that they followed nonusers from the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Such different approaches to follow-up could potentially bias the findings.\nTo resolve this problem, with the index date defined by diabetes diagnosis, a time-dependent drug exposure approach can be used to reduce immortal time bias that arose in this study. 2 Immortal time refers to the period of follow-up during which the outcome could not occur due to the study design. 2 By the current study design, the period between the diagnosis of diabetes and the first date of aspirin prescription among aspirin users was the immortal time. Since they did not consider this period, the HR for breast cancer might be un-derestimated due to the reduced person-years of nonusers. Otherwise, setting 2 years of baseline after diabetes diagnosis is recommended. Patients can be followed up from the end of the baseline period. This method may also lead to more accurate results.\nThus, it would be informative if the authors repeated their analysis using one of the study designs already mentioned.

Among older adults, diabetes morbidity disproportionately burdens racial/ ethnic minorities, but diabetes emergence among younger adults has not been as well characterized. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, suboptimal preconception glycemic control, and prediabetes among women of reproductive age across racial/ethnic backgrounds. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data collected in 2007-2008 from 6774 nonpregnant women, ages 24-32, in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were identified by fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and diagnosed diabetes by selfreport or antihyperglycemic medication use. We used multinomial regression models to predict prediabetes or diabetes versus normoglycemia. Within women with diabetes, we used logistic regression to predict those being undiagnosed and having suboptimal preconception glycemic control based on A1C. Results: The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 6.8%, of which 45.3% was undiagnosed. Diabetes prevalence varied by race/ethnicity ( p < 0.001): 15.0% of non-Hispanic black women (75.6% undiagnosed), 7.5% of Hispanic women (48.1% undiagnosed), 4.8% of non-Hispanic white women (22.8% undiagnosed), and 4.5% of Asian women (11.4% undiagnosed). The prevalence of prediabetes was highest in non-Hispanic black (38.5%), followed by Hispanic (27.8%), Asian (25.1%), Native American (20.3%), and non-Hispanic white (16.6%) women. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic disparities exist among women of reproductive age with prediabetes and diabetes.

[4][5][6][7][8] To reduce diabetes-related risks during pregnancy, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that women strive to lower their blood glucose until they achieve glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) values below 6.5% by using preconception care as well as contraception to delay pregnancy until they are ready. 9 Women whose diabetes is undiagnosed, by definition, have not been identified as appropriate candidates of the ADA recommendations for care to improve glycemic control before pregnancy. Understanding the growing prevalence and distribution of diabetes diagnoses and elevated blood glucose among women of reproductive age is critical for targeting improved reproductive health service delivery, including both preconception care and family planning, in coordination with diabetes management.\nIn the United States (U.S.), diabetes morbidity disproportionately burdens people who are racial/ethnic minorities. Compared with non-Hispanic white adults, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults are more likely to have diabetes, elevated A1C, and sequelae such as lower extremity amputation, retinopathy, and kidney failure. [10][11][12][13] Diabetes incidence has been increasing at faster rates among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults than non-Hispanic white adults. 11 The prevalence of prepregnancy diabetes has increased among women giving birth in hospitals. 14 Among deliveries in hospitals in 19 states, the highest rates and highest absolute rate changes in prepregnancy diabetes occurred among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women. 15 However, the prevalence of diabetes in nationally representative samples is rarely described with stratification by age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the manner necessary to understand trends in diabetes as a risk factor for adverse obstetrical outcomes.

Alarmingly, more than half of non-Hispanic black women exhibited evidence of either prediabetes or diabetes. Early identification and effective management of diabetes are critical for supporting women in optimizing their health and having safe pregnancies if and when they desire to bear children.\nWe estimate that 21.8% of women aged 24-32 years had prediabetes, which more than doubles the odds of developing gestational diabetes, increasing risks of macrosomia, preeclampsia, and shoulder dystocia. 9 An estimated 6.8% of women aged 24-32 years had diabetes, of whom over half (51.0%) had suboptimal preconception glycemic control. Notably, 88.2% of non-Hispanic black women with diabetes exhibited an A1C \u20216.5%. Women with diabetes can reduce the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal anomalies, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, through preconception care, which includes lowering blood glucose, using contraception to time pregnancies, and other interventions. 23 Contraception use creates a window of time in which women may engage in preconception behaviors before trying to conceive. Our findings about diabetes prevalence among women of reproductive age highlight the importance of performing randomized clinical trials to identify the optimal preconception care protocol. 24 We found a greater proportion of women, aged 24-32 years, with diabetes to be undiagnosed (45.3%) than has been observed in the overall adult population (23.8%). 25 Lack of insurance and inadequate access to care, although not significant in our models, are well-documented barriers to diabetes screening. 26 However, underdetection also persists because of nonadherence to the ADA criteria for screening. 27 The importance of adhering to screening criteria for people under age 45, before universal screening is recommended, is underscored by our findings that the majority (74.7%) of women aged 24-32 years with undiagnosed diabetes had an A1C \u2021 6.5%. We note several limitations. Wave IV of Add Health was collected before implementation of the Affordable Care Act; not capturing the impact of those policy changes, this analysis may serve as a point of comparison. Participants in Add Health were not asked if they had type 1 or 2 diabetes, a limitation we deemed tolerable because, in both conditions, elevated blood glucose exerts the same physiological effect, particularly during organogenesis in the early weeks of pregnancy. 9 While the Add Health sample was large enough to support stratification by both gender and race/ethnicity, the small cell counts for Native Americans should limit inferences about nonsignificant results, in light of other data about diabetes prevalence in those communities. [28][29][30] Nonetheless, Add Health's large sample of young adults can address the sample size limitation encountered with the National Health Examination and Nutrition Study (NHANES), the probability sample whose biomarker data are frequently used to generate population estimates about diabetes. 31 We question how realistic it was that 49.0% of women with some evidence of diabetes had an A1C <6.5% due to excellent glycemic management. It is possible that instead this sample includes measurement errors resulting from women not correctly fasting before undergoing a fasting glucose test, self-reporting diabetes history incorrectly (i.e., reporting a history of gestational diabetes despite being instructed to exclude those), or taking antihyperglycemic medications for other purposes (i.e., metformin for polycystic ovarian syndrome). To address this concern, we modeled having an A1C \u20216.5% (Table 4). We found dramatically higher odds of non-Hispanic black women experiencing suboptimal preconception glycemic control than non-Hispanic white women.\nOur findings should be contextualized in the larger body of evidence that non-Hispanic black women and Hispanic women are disproportionately burdened by adverse obstetric outcomes. [32][33][34] We recommend that future research should examine whether enhancing diabetes management in coordination with reproductive healthcare could be an innovative strategy for pursuing racial/ethnic equity in both women's health and infant health. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women with prepregnancy diabetes in the United States have identified numerous barriers to achieving glycemic control before, during, and after pregnancy: costs of supplies, medications, and nutritious food; challenges with maintaining diet and exercise regimens; and difficulties communicating with providers. 35 To support women to optimize their health, we must center the voices of those most affected and address structural barriers to wellness.", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In the U.S., there is a growing population of women of reproductive age with prediabetes and diabetes, many of whom are unaware that they are at heightened risk of, or already have, elevated blood glucose, threatening health during future pregnancies.

minority women (SMW) are less likely to use sexual and reproductive health care services and receive contraceptive counseling than their heterosexual peers. The role of recent sexual partners and the type of information provided when SMW access health services are unclear. Methods: The National Survey of Family Growth 2006-2015 was used to document sexual orientation disparities in the use of sexual and reproductive health services and counseling in clinical settings among 20,703 women. We incorporate data on sexual partners in the past 12 months to investigate whether recent sex with men was associated with health care seeking behavior and reproductive counseling. Results: Eight-seven percent of the sample reported a male partner in the past 12 months, including 83% of bisexual women and 17% of lesbian women. In clinical settings, 48% of women reported birth control counseling at pregnancy or Pap tests, 49% reported a condom consult at an sexually transmitted diseases (STD) screening, and 9% reported emergency contraception counseling at a Pap test. Logistic regression models show that lesbian women were less likely than heterosexual women to have been given a contraceptive prescription or received contraceptive counseling, but were more likely to have received an STD test. In clinical settings, lesbian women were less likely to receive contraceptive counseling at pregnancy tests, and lesbian women without male partners were less likely to have a counseling about condom use at STD-related visits compared with heterosexual women. Conclusions: At least some women and providers adjust health care seeking behaviors and information provided to women based upon recent sexual behavior histories. More work is needed to understand why disparities in reproductive health services and contraceptive use persist among SMW who engage in sex with men.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A growing body of literature has found that sexual minority women (SMW) (i.e., women who do not identify as exclusively heterosexual and/or engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships [SMW]) have an increased risk of reporting sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and unintended pregnancy compared with their heterosexual peers. [1][2][3][4] This disparity may be due, in part, to less frequent use of sexual and reproductive health services among SMW including Pap tests, STD screening, and contraceptive use, 1,[5][6][7][8][9] in addition to the types of health care counseling that occurs in the settings.\nPrevious research has documented multiple factors that contribute to SMW's lower utilization of sexual and reproductive health services, including decreased access to insurance 10 and avoidance of health care settings due to experiences of discrimination in these settings. Discriminatory experiences in clinical settings range from providers' difficulty with eye contact, lack of provider comfort with same-sex partners in the clinical setting, intake forms that ask exclusively about opposite sex romantic partners, to overt homophobic slurs or comments. [11][12][13][14] Awkwardness surrounding candid conversations about sexuality and lack of inclusive language leave some SMW feeling isolated and serve as a barrier to communication. 15,16 Further, medical education programs provide limited opportunities for health practitioners to gain training on Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgendered (LBGT) health issues. 17 SMW are also less likely to have sexual education in classroom settings that includes LGBT-specific information 18 and more likely to use the internet for sexual health information than heterosexual youth 19,20 leaving them vulnerable to misinformation or a lack of accurate sexual health information. 21,22 Perhaps relatedly, SMW are also less likely to perceive themselves as being at risk for an STD or pregnancy, especially those who identify as gay or lesbian, 23 which is associated with less frequent use of sexual and reproductive health services. 23,24 While women who are exclusively engaged in same-sex sexual relationships are indeed not at risk for an unintended pregnancy and do not need contraception for the explicit purpose of preventing an unplanned pregnancy, STD transmission is possible. 25,26 Recently, Charlton et al. 27 found that health beliefs explained 19% of the disparity in intention to have a Pap test between lesbian and heterosexual women: lesbian-identified women in their study did not believe that they were as susceptible to cervical cancer as heterosexual women. The perception of decreased sexual health risks has been found in other studies as well. [28][29][30] Research shows, however, that sexual relationships with men are not uncommon among SMW. [31][32][33] Using nationally representative data of adult women, Xu et al. showed that 10% of lesbian women reported a male partner in the past 12 months, and 84% reported a male partner in their lifetime, while 79% of bisexual women reported a male partner in the past 12 months and 100% reported a male partner in their lifetime in these data. 34 Using National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data, Tornello et al. showed that among women ages 15-20, lesbian women reported an average of 3.7 and bisexual women reported 4.4 lifetime male partners, compared with 1.7 lifetime male partners reported by heterosexual women. 35 These data suggest that SMW may be as likely to benefit from sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive counseling, and discussions of safe sex as heterosexual women.\nSexual orientation disparities in sexual and reproductive health service use and the barriers to care, however, are not yet fully understood. This lack of clarity is in part because, depending on the mode of measurement-sexual identity or sexual behavior-a different portrait of health disparity landscape emerges. For example, Ag\u00e9nor et al. used the 2011-2013 and 2013-2015 NSFG data to examine disparities in sexual and reproductive health care use by identity and behavior separately. 8 They found that behaviorally bisexual women were more likely to use screening services than behaviorally heterosexual women. Their results by identity revealed that lesbian-identified women were less likely to have STD testing and Pap testing compared with heterosexualidentified women; bisexual-identified women were more likely to have an STD test, but less likely to have a recent Pap test. 8 These results provide a mixed portrait of sexual health care use among SMW. They suggest that depending on the mode of measurement (identity vs. behavior), inferences about reproductive health needs of the SM population may vary. It is unclear, however, whether recent sexual behaviors and relationships influence the use of sexual and reproductive health services or the types of information women are provided in these settings. Increasingly, researchers have argued that indicators of both sexual identity and behavior must be incorporated in research to understand how risk is distributed across sexual orientations. 2,36 We propose that one underexplored mechanism that may influence SMW's use of sexual and reproductive health services is sex with men. While sex with men is fairly common among SMW, 3,34,35 it is unclear if it influences whether SMW seek care or the type of care they receive in clinical settings. This study uses the NSFG 2006-2015 to investigate sexual orientation disparities in the use of contraception and reproductive health services, and the types of counseling provided in health care settings. Finally, we explore interactions between sexual identity and recent sex with men to determine whether sexual relationships with men influence SMW's use of sexual and reproductive health services, but also the types of sexual health information they receive.\nSpecifically, we hypothesize that (1) lesbian and bisexual women will be less likely to use all forms of sexual and reproductive health services compared with heterosexual women, but these disparities will be reduced after adjusting for male partners in the past 12 months; (2) lesbian and bisexual women will be less likely to receive contraceptive and STD counseling in health care settings compared with heterosexual women, but these disparities will decrease after adjusting for male partners in the past 12 months.", "n_publication_ref": 45, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "Data for this study come from the NSFG 2006-2015 surveys. NSFG is a cross-sectional, nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. household population between the ages of 15 and 44. 37 Data are collected during face-to-face interviews with female interviewers; however, sensitive data are collected using audio computer assisted self-interview software (ACASI). Response rates for the NSFG data are around 73%. Our sample is restricted to women age 18 or over (n = 21,071). We focus our study on adult women because this population is less likely to be living at home with parents and seeking reproductive care under parental supervision, which may affect both the type of care sought and the discussions that occur in health care settings. Women who did not answer or answered ''don't know'' to the sexual identity or behavior questions were excluded (n = 314). We also eliminated women who were missing on other variables included in the analysis (n = 54). For all outcome variables, missing data accounted for less than 0.5% of the sample. Our final total sample size is 20,703 respondents.\nIn June 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed its Pap test guidelines in a way that both the recommended first age and frequency of Pap testing decreased such that women ages 21-30 receive Pap tests every 3 years, and after age 30 testing occurs every 5 years. Thus, we used two samples for our Pap test analysis, one for participants interviewed before or during June 2012 (n = 8,022), and one for participants ages 21-30 interviewed after June 2012 (n = 5,214)\nThe second part of the analysis focuses on the types of sexual health-related information provided in health care settings.

Birth control prescription is a dichotomous measure of whether a participant reported receiving a method of birth control or a prescription for a method (1 = yes, 0 = no). Birth control counseling is a dichotomous measure of whether a participant reported receiving counseling or information about birth control in the past 12 months (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nPap test in the past 12 months was derived from the following question: ''In the past 12 months have you received a Pap test, where a doctor or nurse put an instrument in the vagina and took a sample to check for abnormal cells that could turn into cervical cancer?'' (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nSTD screening was coded as a dichotomous measure that captures whether participants reported having received counseling for, or been tested or treated for a sexually transmitted disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nCounseling in health care settings. The next set of measures is specifically focused on information conferred in medical settings. The responses are restricted to participants who reported having received the specific health care service noted in the survey question.\nBirth control counseling at pregnancy test was measured using an item that asked women who reported receiving a pregnancy test from a medical provider in the past 12 months: ''During your visit in the past 12 months when you received a pregnancy test, did a doctor or medical provider talk to you about using birth control?'' (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nBirth control counseling at Pap Smear or Pelvic Exam was coded as a dichotomous variable derived from the survey item ''when you received a Pap test or pelvic exam in the past 12 months, did a doctor or medical provider talk to you about using birth control?'' (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nEmergency Contraceptive (EC) counseling at Pap Test or Pelvic Exam was measured using the following survey item, which is administered to women who reported having a Pap smear or pelvic exam in the last 12 months: ''During your visit when you received a Pap test or a pelvic exam, did a doctor or medical provider talk to you about using EC, also known as ''Plan B'' or the ''morning after pill?'' (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nCondom consult at STD Testing/Treatment was measured using a survey item that asks women who received STD testing or treatment in the past 12 months, ''when you received STD testing or treatment, did a doctor or medical provider talk to you about using condoms to prevent disease?'' (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nCovariates. Age was coded as a continuous variable that ranges from 20 to 45. We also include a logged-term for age to account for nonlinearity in our results. Race/Ethnicity was assessed using two survey items that asked participants (1) ''Are you Hispanic, Latina, or of Spanish origin; and (2) ''Which of these groups (American Indian of Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Black or African American, or White) best describes your racial background?'' We created a series of four dummy variables: non-Hispanic white (referent), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other.\nEducation was coded as a series of dummy variables using the following two survey items: (1) ''What is the highest grade or year of school you have ever attended''; and (2) ''Do you have any college or university degree?'' From these two items, education was coded into three dummy variables that capture whether respondents reported having a high school degree or fewer years of education, some college, or having received a college degree (referent).\nIndividuals were coded as having received public assistance if they responded yes that they have used any form of public assistance program such as cash welfare, SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program), or WIC in the past year.\nInsurance status was measured using a series of dummy variables that capture whether participants were covered by private insurance or Medi-Gap (referent); Medicaid, CHIP, or state-sponsored health plan; Medicare, military, or other government health insurance; or covered only by a single service plan, only the Indian Health Service, or not insured.\nRelationship Status was derived from a survey item that asks participants about their current relationship status. Respondents who reported they were ''married to the someone of the opposite sex'' or ''not married by living together with a partner of the opposite sex'' were coded as 1, all others (i.e., never been married, divorced) were coded as 0 (referent). 1 Parity was measured using a continuous variable that capture the number of pregnancies a woman has experienced at the time of interview and ranges from 0 to 10. We additionally measured whether a woman reported a pregnancy ending in the past 12 months (1 = yes, 0 = no). We also measured whether a participant reported that she was currently pregnant (1 = yes, 0 = no). For our analysis of Pap test in the past 12 months, we also adjusted for abnormal Pap test in the past 3 years (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nIntrauterine device (IUD) or Implant use in the past year was derived from measures that asked respondents to list all the forms of birth control they had used in the past year with their three most recent partners. Participants who reported implant or IUD use were coded as yes (1) or no (0). Sterilization was derived from the same series of measures and measures whether a participant reported relying on female sterilization for birth control (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nData of Interview were measured in century months. Century months is a continuous measure used in demographic and health surveys and begins at 1 for January 1900 and increases one-unit for each month following.

", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "By including both sexual identity and recent sexual behavior measures, this analysis fills an important gap in our understanding of the relationship between sexual orientation and sexual and reproductive health service use. In particular, our work adds new knowledge on the types of information that providers communicate to patients in sexual and reproductive health care settings. Recently, Ag\u00e9nor et al. showed that behaviorally bisexual women were more likely to use screening services than behaviorally heterosexual women and lesbian women were less likely to use services than heterosexual women. Ag\u00e9nor et al., however, used a lifetime measure of sexual partners, which may include sexual partners from many years prior who have little or no impact on current sexual behaviors.\nBy restricting our analysis to partners in the past 12 months, our results show that in many of our outcomes (i.e., birth control prescriptions, birth control counseling, Pap test pre-June 2012, and birth control counseling at Pap test), sexual orientation disparities were contingent upon recent sexual relationships with men. Further, in the case of STD screening, lesbian women may be more proactive in seeking care. Increased use of STD-related services among lesbian women with recent male partners may mean that STD screening may be an ideal time to have discussion around contraceptive counseling for women who may otherwise avoid sexual and reproductive health settings. Our results also demonstrate that disparities in sexual and reproductive health outcomes may not be entirely driven by lower sexual and reproductive health service use, but also by the types of information that are communicated in clinical settings to SMW. The fact that lesbian women are less likely to be consulted about birth control during visits for pregnancy tests suggests that these interactions are a missed opportunity for contraceptive counseling.\nOur results also show that in at least some cases, patients and providers are able to adjust counseling scripts based upon behavior: that is, women, providers, or both, may work together to communicate health needs during interactions. However, more work is needed to understand why sexual orientation disparities in STDs and unintended pregnancy persist if providers are communicating pertinent sexual health information to SMW who engage in heterosexual sex. It may be that manner in which the information is communicated is not very effective; multiple studies have documented that SMW experience high rates of discrimination in clinical settings. 14,38,39 Alternatively, it may be that SMW, even those who have recently had sex with a man, do not anticipate such encounters in the future and are therefore less likely to be receptive to using contraception. Further, if a woman is in a same-sex relationship, or primarily dates women, using a form of contraception may be seen as stigmatizing, or signal a lack of commitment to a lesbian identity or a same-sex partner. Indeed, it remains that lesbian women in clinical settings are not reporting contraceptive counseling at pregnancy tests and lesbian women who have not had sex with a man in the past 12 months are largely not being provided with sexual health information related to condom use at STD-related visits. Given that SMW are more likely to turn to internet sources, 19,20 which may be inaccurate or focus almost exclusively on HIV-prevention, 21,22 these interactions are a missed opportunity for accessing medically accurate and inclusive sexual health information. These missed opportunities for sexual health information are particularly troubling in light of research that has shown an increased risk for STDs among SMW compared with heterosexuals. 2 This study has several limitations. First, while we attempted to correctly time order our variables by restricting recent sexual partners to the past 12 months, it is possible because the data are cross-sectional and that interactions with providers happened before the sexual interaction. Second, although we attempted to address the effect of changes in Pap test guidelines in our analysis, it is possible that some women had not received a Pap test in the past year as they may have had a Pap test in the recent past in-line with current recommendations. It is also possible that some women did not receive a birth control method or a prescription for one in the past year because they were using a long-term form of contraception. While we controlled for reported IUD and implant use, in addition to sterilization, in the past year, it is possible that some of these methods have been in use for a long period of time. Fourth, the survey did not include other indicators of patient-provider discussion around safe sex except for consultation about condom use at STD-related screenings. A condom consult does not address many facets of safe sex for SMW. Fifth, we do not have measures of discrimination in medical settings, patientprovider trust, sexual orientation disclosure, or detailed measures of the content of information provided in medical settings, nor the providers' communication style. All of these factors may influence how patients receive medical information and are able to translate it into health behaviors. We also lack data on gender identity for our sample and their sexual partners. Simple measures of ''sex with men'' do not capture important nuances and differences in sexual health risks between cisgender and transmen. Finally, our data are all self-reported. While we limited our outcomes and behaviors to the past year to reduce recall bias, because of the sensitive nature of some of the outcome variables, it is possible that data suffer from underreporting. Future research will benefit from the use of longitudinal data, incorporation of electronic medical records, and a broader spectrum of safe-sex behaviors more inclusive of the LGBT population, including the assessment of both participant and their sexual partners' gender identity.\nDespite these limitations, our research emphasizes the importance of addressing the sexual health needs of SMW in sexual and reproductive care settings and the need to look at both identity and recent sexual behaviors. Our results highlight the role sexual relationships with men play in women's use of sexual and reproductive health services, but also the types of counseling they receive in these settings. The delivery of important sexual health information, including contraceptive counseling and information about safe-sex practices, however, should not be contingent on whether a woman has had a recent sexual relationship with a man. SMW may benefit from learning about noncontraceptive benefits of birth control, a broader spectrum of safe-sex sexual behaviors, and given the documented high rates of sexual fluidity among women, 31,33,40 many SMW may benefit from some information on contraception and STD prevention even if they have not recently had a male sexual partner. Likewise, an LGBTQ-inclusive, nonjudgmental sexual health counseling script may serve as an important opportunity to address gaps in knowledge around safe sex in same-sex relationships and in relationships with trans-partners for all woman. Simply asking women about their sexual orientation may facilitate patient-provider trust and improve care. 16 More research is needed to develop sexual and reproductive health counseling scripts that are informative and inclusive, but avoid assumptions about who may benefit from what information based upon sexual identities or behaviors.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "This study is supported by the Society for Family Planning Interdisciplinary Innovations Grant SFPRF-11-II3.

States that expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) make public insurance free for many low-income women regardless of parental or pregnancy status. Our objective is to analyze the effects of expanding Medicaid in Ohio on enrollment of pregnant women and receipt of recommended prenatal care. A key objective in the state is to address infant mortality as Ohio ranks above the national average and racial disparities persist. Materials and Methods: We used linked enrollment/claims/birth certificate data for women with Medicaid-paid deliveries/births, aged 19-44 years with months of last menstrual period (LMP) in calendar year 2011-2015 (N = 290,091). We used interrupted time-series analysis of enrollment prepregnancy and receipt of guidelineconcordant screenings (anemia, asymptomatic bacteriuria, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and TORCH) and prenatal vitamins after versus before the expansion. We stratified by parity since first-time mothers would be impacted more. Results: We found almost a 12 percentage point increase in enrollment prepregnancy among first-time mothers compared with almost a 6 percentage point increase for parous women. We found significant increases in all screens and vitamins for both groups. TORCH screening increased 8 percentage points and receipt of prenatal vitamins almost 14 percentage points, by the end of 2015 for first-time mothers, compared with 5 and 4 percentage points, respectively, for parous women. Conclusions: Early enrollment and prenatal care for low-income women in Ohio could erode if the state's Medicaid expansion is altered.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W hile the U.S. infant mortality rate has declined in recent years, it continues to lag other developed countries. 1,2 Within the United States, infant mortality varies considerably across states. In 2014, Ohio's infant mortality rate was 6.8 deaths per 1000 live births, 3 higher than the national rate of 5.8 deaths per 1000 live births 4 and exceeding the national Healthy People 2020 goal. 5 Within Ohio, pronounced racial disparities in infant mortality also exist; in 2015 black infants were almost three times as likely to die before reaching their first birthday as whites, with an infant mortality rate of 15.1 versus 5.5 per 1000 live births, respectively. 3 Reducing the infant mortality rate has been a priority for Ohio state agencies since 2009, with the Governor's Office of Health Transformation working with Ohio's Departments of Health, Medicaid, and Mental Health and Addiction Services, as well as other human services agencies on reforms to improve overall health system performance for pregnant women and infants. 6 Ohio law requires every county to review the deaths of children. According to the 2013 review, >60% of Ohio's infant deaths are attributable to preterm birth and birth defects, 7 pregnancy outcomes that may be preventable through interventions in the prenatal and preconception periods. By some estimates, 6% of all Ohio mothers received late (third trimester) or no prenatal care during their pregnancies in 2013. 8 Although questions persist about the impact of prenatal care on pregnancy outcomes, the adequate and timely receipt of prenatal care has been associated with the reduced risk of low birth weight, stillbirth, early and late neonatal death, and infant death, as well as with maternal health behaviors linked with improved pregnancy outcomes. [9][10][11][12][13] Although pregnant women are encouraged to schedule their initial prenatal visit during their first trimester, care ideally begins before conception and includes preventive care, counseling, and screenings for risks to maternal and fetal health. 14,15 Nationally, the timing of prenatal care entry varies greatly by race/ethnicity and insurance status, with rates of first trimester prenatal care initiation being highest for non-Hispanic whites and those with private insurance. 16 Lack of health insurance is associated with delaying or forgoing preventive health services and other medical care. 17 Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), women in the United States faced unique challenges in obtaining or maintaining health insurance for numerous reasons, 18 including historical Medicaid eligibility rules that largely omitted women without dependent children, then qualified lower income women as eligible during pregnancy, but removed them 60 days postpartum. 19 A 2009 study documented that approximately one-third of first-time mothers experienced transitions in insurance coverage, most commonly moving from being uninsured before pregnancy to having Medicaid by the time of delivery. Moreover, these levels and patterns of coverage were largely unchanged since late 1990s. 20,21 Compared with higher income women, low-income mothers are more likely to be uninsured before becoming pregnant and to have three or more chronic diseases and/or related risk factors that could affect birth outcomes if left untreated or not managed appropriately. 22 Recent research on the pre-ACA period documented that 58% of women experience at least one change in insurance status in the 9 months leading up to and including delivery, whereas 55% of women with Medicaid at delivery experienced a coverage gap in the following 6 months; the authors called for analysis of the impact of the ACA in minimizing the adverse effects of such ''churning.'' 23 In 2014, Ohio expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. Before this, Ohio's Medicaid program covered pregnant women up to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL); parents were eligible if they were \u00a390% FPL, and Ohio Medicaid did not offer coverage to nondisabled childless adults. 24 The expected effect of Ohio's expansion of Medicaid coverage to all adults \u00a3138% FPL is to increase the proportion of low-income women who deliver on Medicaid who have coverage that begins before pregnancy or early in pregnancy, thereby improving access to prenatal care. As pregnancy and delivery were covered for women up to 200% FPL in Ohio before the ACA, with coverage before pregnancy for some parents (\u00a390% FPL), we expect women having their first birth in the post-ACA period to be most affected by the Ohio expansion. Before the ACA expansion, these women would not have been categorically eligible for Medicaid before pregnancy.\nFrom an economic perspective, the ACA Medicaid expansion made public insurance free for many childless women who would otherwise have been uninsured, reducing out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives and pregnancy-related expenses. Lower out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives should increase the quantity and/or quality used and, in turn, increase intendedness of pregnancy and reduce births. 25,26 A reduction in the costs of pregnancy-related expenses should lead to higher rates of prenatal and preventive care during pregnancy. 27 Earlier studies of Medicaid expansions suggest expected effects. Analysis of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment found evidence of increased hospital, outpatient, and medication utilization, as well as increased compliance with recommended preventive care. 28 Studies have found evidence that state Medicaid expansions decreased uninsurance and delays in care seeking due to costs. 29 In addition, the ACA Medicaid expansion increased use of certain forms of preventive care and modestly improved self-rated health. 30 Our study is novel in examining the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion on the likelihood that women of reproductive age take up Medicaid insurance at an earlier gestational age and receive timely guideline-concordant prenatal screenings and interventions during their pregnancy.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data sources and study sample", "text": "The Ohio Department of Medicaid and the Ohio Department of Health granted permission for access to its electronic Medicaid enrollment and encounter records and birth certificate records, respectively. The study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards of the Ohio State University, Emory University, and the Ohio Department of Health. Personal identifiers were used to perform a welldocumented iterative matching process between Medicaid administrative records and yearly Ohio Birth Certificates that involved both deterministic and probabilistic matching. 31,32 The match rate of women with a Medicaid-paid delivery claim to an Ohio Birth Certificate averaged 87.4% across study years. Indicators of health system utilization were generated from procedure, diagnosis, and drug billing codes recorded on inpatient and outpatient encounter claims for deliveries/births with any amount of Medicaid payment.\nTo capture pre-and postpregnancy information, encounters with a date of service 6 months before the date of last menstrual period (LMP) through 6 months postpartum were included for each birth. The source of LMP was the Ohio Birth Certificate. If LMP date was missing on the woman's record, the infant's gestational age at delivery was used to determine LMP (N = 23,255; 8.5%). If both LMP and gestational age at delivery were missing on birth records, LMP was calculated by subtracting 9 months from the infant's date of birth (<1%). Medicaid enrollment status was obtained from monthly administrative eligibility records. Record matching and data processing were completed in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).\nFrom these files, we defined an initial study cohort as those deliveries/births paid by Ohio Medicaid during calendar years 2011 through 2016, aged 19-44 years and with months of LMP in calendar years 2011-2015 (N = 290,091). We then omitted from this cohort those with month of LMP in the last quarter of 2013 to assure that the analysis of women getting prenatal screens included only those whose first trimester occurred fully in the pre-or post-ACA periods. Our final study population equaled 274,541, comprising 155,778 women in the pre-ACA period and 118,763 women in the post-ACA period. Services were considered early in pregnancy if the service date was between LMP date and LMP date plus 16 weeks; we chose 16 weeks to account for services that occurred within the first trimester (within 12 weeks of LMP) and allowed for 4 additional weeks given that enrollment data are by month.\nFor the analysis of mean months and continuous enrollment during pregnancy, we omitted women with LMP in the last three quarters of 2013 to assure that the analysis considered only women whose pregnancy occurred fully in the post-ACA period, resulting in N = 245,355. We excluded younger teens since their eligibility for Medicaid/Children's Health Inisurance Program (CHIP) was not directly affected by the ACA expansion. Data on Medicaid enrollment for the last quarter of 2010 were used to assess enrollment before LMP of January 2011, and administrative encounter data through the second quarter of 2016 were used to assess early prenatal screens for those with LMP of December 2015.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Dependent variables", "text": "The outcomes studied include several measures of enrollment before and during pregnancy, as well as the receipt of early prenatal care. Specifically, we tested for effects on the following as indicators of reduced ''churn'' for women with Medicaid-paid deliveries: (1) enrollment prepregnancy, (2) enrollment in the first trimester of pregnancy, (3) number of months enrolled during pregnancy, and (4) continuous enrollment throughout pregnancy. In turn, we tested for effects on receipt of the guideline-concordant screenings early in pregnancy (including for anemia, asymptomatic bacteriuria, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and TORCH [a blood test that screens for a broad set of maternal infections that can be passed vertically to the infant during pregnancy, including toxoplasmosis, syphilis, measles, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus]) and receipt of prenatal vitamins within 12 weeks.\nThere is wide agreement that the timely receipt of these screens and prenatal vitamins is considered guidelineconcordant prenatal care based on recommendations from one or more of the following, as documented in Table 1: (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2) Institute of Medicine, (3) American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, (4) US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), or (5) National Committee for Quality Assurance.

As the ACA made more women eligible preconception on the basis of income, rather than on the basis of parental status and income, we stratified our analyses based on parity or the number of times a women has carried a pregnancy to a viable gestational age (parity = 0 vs. parity \u20211).\nNext, we used regression models and interrupted timeseries to analyze changes in our outcomes of interest. This type of analysis uses data collected at multiple time points (monthly/quarterly) before and after an intervention to detect whether the intervention had a significantly greater effect on the trend than any underlying secular trend. 38 We estimated logistic regressions (or linear regressions as appropriate) and derived marginal effects of changes in the probability of timely screens/vitamin intake and enrollment measures.\nIn the regressions, we controlled for mother's age, education, race, marital status, parity, poor prior outcome, prior preterm birth, months enrolled during pregnancy, Medicaid category during pregnancy, previous Medicaid birth, obstetricians/gynecologists per 10,000 women (aged 15-44 years), Ohio regional code (Appalachian, rural, metropolitan, suburban, and missing), seasonality (using summer season as reference category), and father's education.

Descriptive data in Figures 1 and 2 show an increase in all enrollment measures for both study populations. As would be expected with any new policy, it takes time for participation rates to increase and more women to enroll as eligibility expansions start. For example, the percentage of first-time mothers (women with parity = 0) enrolled prepregnancy increased from *27% in the last quarter of 2013 to *42% by the fourth quarter of 2014 and steadily increased to *48% in the fourth quarter of 2015 (Fig. 1). In the first quarter of 2013 (pre-ACA), a large percentage (77.5%) of first-time mothers were enrolled during their first trimester, and by the first quarter of 2015 this equaled 82.3%. The percentage of this group of mothers enrolled during their entire pregnancy increased from *29% to 49% over these quarters, but this percentage declined slightly by the end of 2015.\nSimilar patterns are seen for parous women (those with parity \u20211) in Figure 2. For parous women, the percentage enrolled prepregnancy was higher at the end of 2013 (66.5% vs. *27% already noted) and increased through the first quarter of 2015 (77.7%), but declined slightly after that to 76.3%. Figure 2 indicates that the percentage of parous women who enrolled their entire pregnancy increased from *64% in the first quarter of 2013 to *76% in the first quarter of 2015. Although both first-time mothers and parous women enjoyed greater prepregnancy and first trimester enrollment, facilitating the provision of best reproductive health practice, there were slight declines in the latter part of 2015. We also noted that 52% of first-time Ohio mothers with Medicaidpaid deliveries were not enrolled in their entire pregnancy, even after the ACA expansion; in comparison, this applied to *27% of those having their second or higher birth.\nIn Figure 3, the descriptive data for timely screens are arrayed by LMP quarter for the full study population. These data indicate a clear upward trend in the post-ACA period in Ohio in the receipt of all screenings as well as vitamins. From the third quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2015, there were increases of 5.0 percentage points (anemia and chlamydia screening \u00a316 weeks) to 5.4 percentage points (TORCH and bacteriuria screening \u00a316 weeks). The receipt of prenatal vitamins among the full study population increased 1.9 percentage points over this period. Although the changes in trends for enrollment and receipt of timely screens could reflect the change in policy under the ACA, they could also reflect changes in the composition of women with a Medicaidpaid delivery in Ohio over the pre-and post-ACA period.\nThe descriptive data given in Table 2 show total and monthly counts of Medicaid-paid deliveries and the characteristics of these women in the study population. The total monthly sample in the pre-ACA period (N = 4720) was somewhat smaller than in the post-ACA period (N = 4948), consistent with the expanded eligibility criteria. Relatively more of the parous women came into Ohio Medicaid coverage for delivery, as their monthly enrollment increased from 3484 pre-ACA to 3754 post-ACA. Based on the data given in Table 2, the characteristics of the women in the Ohio study population are remarkably similar pre-and post-ACA. Only the age and eligibility categories changed by >2 percentage points. With respect to these changes, after the ACA, Ohio women with Medicaid-paid deliveries (whether it was their first birth or second/higher) were more likely to be >25 years old and, as would be expected, less likely to be eligible due to their pregnancy status.\nTo further disentangle the effects of changes in the composition of the women with a Medicaid-paid delivery versus changes attributable to other policy provisions, we present the results of our multivariate analysis in the following section.  33 The Institute of Medicine recommends screening in each trimester of pregnancy. 34 The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women. 35 ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 5}, {"heading": "Bacteriuria", "text": "Receipt of prenatal bacteriuria screening \u00a316 weeks\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women at 12-16 weeks gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later (grade A). 36 ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Chlamydia", "text": "Receipt of prenatal chlamydia screening \u00a316 weeks\nThe NCQA includes an annual chlamydia screening for sexually active women (16-24 years) measure in the HEDIS. 37 The USPSTF only recommends routine screening for pregnant women at increased risk (i.e., those <25 years and engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors; grade A), but notes individual circumstances and local prevalence of infections may support broader screening. 36 ", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HIV", "text": "Receipt of prenatal HIV screening \u00a316 weeks The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all pregnant women for HIV (grade A). 36 ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Marginal effects", "text": "We show the estimated changes in the probability of dichotomous outcomes and on the mean months enrolled postversus pre-ACA (Tables 3 and 4) after controlling for the individual and area characteristics as already noted. We also controlled for any underlying monthly time trends independent of the ACA, as shown in the first columns of Tables 3 and 4. We noted that some of the underlying monthly trends for these prenatal care screens were negative. The effects of the ACA are measured by the 2014 and 2015 indicator variables shown in the remaining columns; these indicators equal ''0'' for any LMP in the pre-ACA period and equal ''1'' for LMP in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Since women with first births would not have been categorically eligible in the pre-ACA period, but newly eligible if \u00a3138% FPL in the post-ACA period, the changes seen for them are more likely due to the ACA Medicaid expansion than other policy changes aimed at improving quality of prenatal care. In the following text, we compare the results for first-time mothers to those of parous women.\nBased on the interrupted time-series analysis, the marginal effects for first-time mothers with Medicaid-paid births in Ohio are given in Table 3. The marginal effects represent percentage point changes in the probability of each outcome. The increase in the probability that first-time mothers were enrolled prepregnancy equaled almost 12 percentage points by 2015 compared with almost 6 percentage points for those with prior births as given in Table 4. Important to the receipt of early prenatal care, the probability of being enrolled in the first trimester also increased for both groups of mothers. Being enrolled the entire pregnancy increases access to providers and, perhaps, continuity of care. As given in Tables 3 and 4, the probability of being enrolled the full pregnancy increased for both groups, but, again, was larger for first-time mothers. For these women, the probability of being enrolled in Medicaid continuously through their pregnancy increased by 6.3 percentage points by 2015, whereas for those with prior births, this increase was 2.2 percentage points.\nEnrollment prepregnancy or earlier in pregnancy would mean women have better access to prenatal care providers. These findings suggest that the probabilities of the guidelineconcordant prenatal care will increase. Overall, the results given in Tables 3 and 4 indicate significant increases in the receipt of all the guideline-concordant prenatal care (and vitamins) in both 2014 and 2015 post-ACA periods. This held for first-time mothers, as well as for those with prior births. For first-time mothers, the receipt of TORCH panel screening \u00a316 weeks increased by 8 percentage points, and screening for chlamydia by almost 6 percentage points, both larger effects than for women with prior births. For those with prior births, the increases in these screens were 5 and *3 percentage points, respectively (Table 4).\nIncreases in screening for anemia \u00a316 weeks were more comparable for the two groups of women. The increase in the receipt of prenatal vitamins among first-time mothers was markedly higher, equal to almost 14 percentage points by 2015, compared with an increase of 4 percentage points for those with prior births. We note that there was an increase in the probability of HIV screening for both groups of women in 2014 and 2015 relative to the pre-ACA period, but the increase in 2015 was smaller than that for 2014 for first-time mothers and flat for parous women.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "This study is not without limitations. As the health services utilization data are based on claims data, there is the possibility of misclassifying the utilization and/or receipt of particular types of services, with some variation in the use of    particular codes according to the provider expectation of payment and setting of care. Provider trainings and interventions that focus on quality of care could also influence receipt of care, and although this is a topic of interest, it is beyond the scope of our research question. Although interrupted time-series analysis is valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of population-level health interventions and is increasingly used to evaluate policy interventions, it is most appropriate when there is a clear differentiation between the pre-and postintervention periods and when studying short-term outcomes  that are expected to change quickly or after a clearly defined lag. We allowed for differentiation of the post-ACA effects by 2014 and 2015.\nInterrupted time-series analysis can also be affected by time-varying confounders that change rapidly. We attempted to account for this limitation by incorporating seasonality into our models. Another limitation is the lack of data on changes in access and use of contraceptives pre-or postpregnancy and intendedness of births. Analysis of postpartum visits and contraception use among those with Ohio Medicaid-paid deliveries is being conducted for inclusion in a future article. We earlier noted that we imputed LMP for *10% of observations; we tested the analysis after omitting these observations and found the results to be robust in terms of the patterns and only small changes in the magnitude of effects. Finally, Ohio is just one of the states expanding Medicaid under the ACA. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to other states given the number of other contextual factors that can drive Medicaid enrollment and service utilization at the state level.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Under the ACA, states could extend Medicaid eligibility to low-income women regardless of their parental or pregnancy status in the hope of addressing the persistent instability in insurance coverage before and after pregnancy seen among low-income women in the United States. 20,21,23 Once insured, providers and patients are better able to detect and address problems before, between, and earlier in pregnancy. Preconception care, or the improvement in women's health status before pregnancy, and interconception care, which focuses on improving women's health status between pregnancies, are increasingly seen as strategies for improving U.S. maternal and infant outcomes. 15,[39][40][41] The results shown here for Ohio provide early evidence that the expansion resulted in significant increases in Medicaid coverage prepregnancy and enrollment in Medicaid throughout pregnancy.\nThe results also indicate significant increases in those who received guideline-concordant screenings and prenatal vitamins early in pregnancy. The expectation is that these changes will lead to improved outcomes; we note that this analysis is part of a broader study of the Ohio expansion that will assess postpartum enrollment and utilization of services and, as more data become available, both maternal and infant outcomes.\nAlthough these positive trends for Ohio are encouraging, there is room for improvement. In particular, the percentage of women receiving the guideline-concordant screens in the post-ACA period (Fig. 3) ranges from 46.7% to 62.4%, well below the 80.5%-89.5% of our study populations enrolled in Ohio Medicaid in their first trimester. This suggests that although the Ohio prenatal care provider system did respond to the newly enrolled pregnant women through improved rates of screening, other obstacles to the receipt of timely screens by Medicaid-insured women may present and warrant further investigation.\nWe note that the improvement in timely screenings was less pronounced for HIV screening than for the other prenatal screenings, which may be attributable to several factors. First, the baseline rate (in the pre-ACA period) was lower than the other screenings. Second, despite the USPSTF recommendation for the screening of all pregnant women for HIV as part of prenatal care, many providers may be unaware of that recommendation and still practice HIV screening based on a risk-based approach, which is supported in the literature. 42 In addition, providers may ask women whether they want to be screened for HIV, and women who believe they are at low risk may elect not to be screened. Related to this, the content of the standard obstetrical panel before 2016 did not include HIV testing, but rather HIV testing had to be ordered separately; some providers may not have been aware of the need to order the HIV testing separately from the obstetrical panel. Although it is difficult to understand why timely HIV screening would decline from 2014 to 2015, in mid-2013, the USPSTF did issue recommendations that everyone aged between 15 and 65 years get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine healthcare. 43 Thus, it is possible that from 2014 to 2015 more women may have been tested before pregnancy and providers may have chosen not to retest in pregnancy.\nThe analysis completed here for Ohio was possible due to the state's linkage of Medicaid administrative data (claims/ encounters and enrollment data) to birth/death vital records over multiple years, data often not available in other states. Mothers and infants remain a priority population regardless of their state of residence. Support for ongoing data linkage efforts and data collection is needed to understand how Medicaid policy changes across states affect mothers and their infants. Having robust data may become more of an issue if changes to the financing of Medicaid lead to cuts in eligibility, benefits, provider reimbursements, or some combination of these in Ohio and other states. There is the potential for many women to return to instability of insurance coverage preconception, during pregnancy, and postpartum.\nFinally, although it is notable that the ACA Medicaid expansion appears to address some of the critical issues related to historical Medicaid policy for women \u00a3138% FPL, the ACA and the Medicaid program still leave pregnant women in the next income strata, from 139% to <200% FPL, at risk of ''churning'' pre-and postpregnancy. Although states may be working with their exchanges to encourage women in this income range to take up private coverage through subsidies, it is unclear how successful this approach will be over time due to uncertainty about the subsidies, insurance markets, and even Medicaid itself. Thus, further investigation of the impact of policies on ''churn,'' insurance coverage prepregnancy, and utilization of care among pregnant women is warranted.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Many elements of the ACA could positively affect women of reproductive age. Expansion of Medicaid to low-income women regardless of whether they were already parents or currently pregnant was a key element in that it could reduce the persistent instability in insurance coverage before and after pregnancy experienced by many low-income women in the United States. Using Medicaid enrollment and claims data for years before and after the implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Ohio, we found that many more first-time mothers had enrolled in Medicaid before their conception and, in turn, were far more likely to receive guideline-concordant prenatal care in their first 16 weeks of pregnancy and to receive prenatal vitamins. These results cannot be generalized beyond our study state. Future study should consider the effects of Medicaid expansion on women of reproductive age and, in particular, those experiencing pregnancy in other states that expanded.

Materials and Methods: Data were abstracted from all interventional Phase I, II, and III clinical trials with adult subjects entered into ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 and completed by November 30, 2015. Number and sex of subjects, funding source, allocation, end point classification, interventional model, and purpose were recorded. Studies pertaining to diseases that were sex specific were excluded.

These guidelines recommended that all women of childbearing potential, defined as any premenopausal female capable of becoming pregnant, be excluded from all early stage clinical trials. 1 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) then published a policy guideline recommending the inclusion of women in biomedical research in 1986. 2 In 1992, the U.S. Government Account-ability Office (GAO) conducted a study aimed at evaluating the representation of women in drug testing and the extent to which sex differences were being studied. The authors concluded that women were underrepresented in a majority of FDA-approved clinical trials. 3 In the face of mounting evidence that sex differences have an impact on healthcare, the NIH Revitalization Act, which was signed into law in 1993, recommended the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research funded by the NIH. 4 Following this legislation, the overall number of women enrolled in NIHsponsored Phase III clinical trials did increase, with 61.9% of NIH-funded clinical study subjects in fiscal year 1997 being women. 5 However, in 2015 the GAO stated that sex-based reporting and analysis of results remains an area of disparity with NIH-funded clinical research. 6 In that same year, the Office of Research on Women's Health, a division of the NIH, published a report outlining the institution's 5-year vision with a stated goal to ''incorporate findings of sex/ gender differences in the design and application of new technologies and therapeutic drugs.'' 7 It is well known that significant sex-based differences exist with respect to how men and women manifest with disease, experience disease, and respond to therapy. The clinical relevance of sex-based differences extends to a wide range of conditions, including neurologic, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, rheumatologic, metabolic, and immunologic disease, among others.

Clinical trials evaluate interventions in a prospective manner and are frequently the last step in the development pipeline before a device or therapeutic goes to market.

The difference in sex-matching percentages among Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials, respectively, at the 50% cutoff level was significant ( p = 0.003). Of Phase I clinical trials, 19.6% met an 80% sexmatching level compared with 23.2% of Phase II and 22.3%  of Phase III clinical trials. These results, at the 80% sexmatching level, were not significant ( p = 0.30). Evaluation by funding source revealed that 57.1% of industry-funded clinical trials met a 50% sex-matching level compared with 56.5% of NIH-funded clinical trials, 52.4% of ''Other US Federal'' funded clinical trials, and 52.9% of ''Other'' clinical trials. Of industry funded clinical trials, 22.9% met an 80% sex-matching level compared with 26.1% of NIH-funded clinical trials, 23.8% of ''Other US Federal'' funded clinical trials, and 16.1% of ''Other'' clinical trials. These differences in sex-matching levels were not significant at a 50% sex-matching level ( p = 0.74) or at an 80% sexmatching level ( p = 0.20).\nEvaluation by randomization status revealed that 56.3% of randomized clinical trials met a 50% sex-matching level compared with 57.5% of nonrandomized clinical trials. Of randomized clinical trials, 22.4% met an 80% sex-matching level compared with 21.7% of nonrandomized clinical trials. These differences in sex-matching levels were not statistically significant at a 50% sex-matching level ( p = 0.74) or at an 80% sex-matching level ( p = 0.55). The analysis of sexmatching across the aforementioned categories is depicted in Figure 3.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We demonstrate that sex bias is present in the enrollment of human subjects in prospectively designed interventional clinical trials listed in the federal registry. Specifically, we show that while the number of male and female subjects included in all clinical trials is nearly equal, the overall number of male and female subjects included in clinical trials is significantly different by clinical trial Phase, funding source, and randomization status, with Phase I clinical trials being the most sex biased. We also show that the matching of male and female subjects included in individual clinical trials is poor, with Phase 1 clinical trials being significantly worse than Phase II and III clinical trials. These data must be considered when drawing conclusions from interventional and prospective clinical trials, as there is a clear call for the need to address this sex bias practice.\nUpon evaluation of the matching of male and female subjects in individual clinical trials, we showed that less than 25% of clinical trials meet an 80% sex-matching standard, indicating that despite near equal male and female subject inclusion overall, their equal inclusion in individual clinical trials is far from equitable. Given that the FDA had effectively barred young and middle aged women from participation in early phase clinical trials between 1977 and 1993, the evolution of sex bias in early phase clinical trials in the modern day is of particular interest. We found that the presence of sex bias with respect to the equal inclusion of male and female subjects in individual clinical trials is markedly greater among Phase I clinical trials compared to Phase II and III clinical trials. Likewise, the percentage of Phase I clinical trials meeting a 50% sex-matching cutoff is significantly less than those of Phase II and III clinical trials. This is of particular importance because Phase I clinical trials represent drugs and interventions in the earlier stages of development. The presence of sex bias at this early stage in the development pipeline could mean that sex differences in outcome measures may go undetected until later stages of drug development. Drug dosing decisions are often made with the first phase of a clinical trial. As such, higher levels of sex bias in Phase I clinical trials could result in poorly informed dosing decisions that do not accurately reflect sexbased differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism. This is corroborated by a U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2001, which found that new drug applications enrolled lower numbers of females in earlier phases of clinical trials. 15 Our study also reports a marginal improvement over an earlier review of 239 Phase I and II clinical trials conducted between 1993 and 2005, which revealed that 35.1% of studies did not include both sexes, with women comprising only 37% of those clinical trials which did enroll both sexes. 16 We also find that NIH-funded clinical trials enrolled a significantly lower percentage of female subjects in aggregate compared to industry-funded trials. This is interesting because current federal regulations regarding sex inclusion only applies to federally funded studies.\nThe clinical trials analyzed in this study include the full range of medical subspecialties and are intended to be a representative cross-section of all clinical trials being performed in the modern day. In analyzing these data, we felt FIG. 3. Analysis of sex matching in clinical trials by: (A) funding source, (B) phase of trial, and (C) randomization status.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "SEX BIAS IN INTERVENTIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS 1345", "text": "that it was important to consider not just the differences in sex distribution between various categories but also the differences in the level of sex matching. This allows us to capture the presence of sex bias that may not be readily apparent when comparing the raw numbers of total enrollees across many trials. Furthermore, the use of sex matching as a metric attempts to capture sex bias in favor of either males or females. This is important because there are a number of studies which exclude subjects of a particular sex. We found the most profound sex bias in the level of sex matching.\nWhile we recognize that it may not be possible for every clinical trial to be 100% sex matched, meeting a 50% sex match is not an unreasonable request. However, the finding that nearly half of all clinical trials do not achieve a 50% sexmatching level infers widespread prevalence of sex bias across all clinical trials. The presence of sex bias across various forms of biomedical research has been well documented in the literature. In 2014, Yoon et al. concluded that significant sex bias exists at the basic and translational research level in surgical disciplines. 17 It was observed that many studies did not report the sex of the animal or cell used in their studies. When they did report the sex, 80% of animal studies and 71% of cell studies used only males. A study of randomized clinical trials published across nine medical journals in 2009 found that 24% of studies did not include both sexes. 18 Of those studies which were not sex specific, 29% enrolled less than 30% women. Based on the results of these studies and others, the NIH created regulations in 2016 requiring that sex be considered an independent variable in NIH-funded studies. In a subsequent study in 2016, Mansukhani et al. found that sex bias was prevalent in human surgical clinical research. 19 Less than one-third of studies were noted to have analyzed their data by sex, and only 45% of studies matched the inclusion of male and females in their study by at least 50% (i.e., two males enrolled per one female enrolled or vice versa). In the present study, the percentage of clinical trials that were 50% sex matched was 56.6%, and the percentage of clinical trials that were 80% sex matched was only 22%. We would expect equal sex matching to be higher than what was observed by the Mansukhani et al. study since the present study is looking exclusively at clinical trials, which are conducted in a prospective manner and subject to federal regulations mandating inclusion of women. We believe that the majority of clinical trials should be almost 100% sex matched (i.e., one male enrolled per one female enrolled) or similar to the prevalence of disease, and 56.6% is not acceptable for modern day clinical trials.\nOur study is not without limitations. The retrospective and observational nature of this study limits the data available for analysis. Furthermore, the analysis performed in this study was limited by the information provided to the clinicaltrials.gov registry in a voluntary manner, which may result in an inherent selection bias. In addition, this study does not compare the prevalence of sex distribution with specific diseases to the sex bias observed in the clinical trials. Other investigators have attempted to control for this by calculating the ratio of proportion of women in the clinical trials to the proportion of women in the disease population. In an analysis of pivotal trials or new drugs/biologics, Eshara et al. defined a ratio between 0.8 and 1.2 as being acceptably representative of the population at large. 20 While our data set allows us to identify the specific condition being addressed by a given study, the clinicaltrials.gov database puts these conditions into 25 different categories. Complicating a stratified analysis is the fact that the sex predisposition of conditions varies significantly even within a given defined category. For example, the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is higher in females, whereas the prevalence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and dilated cardiomyopathies is greater in males. In addition, the ability to do such a disease prevalence based analysis is the differential prevalence of disease in males versus females in different age groups-this is partly attributed to the fact that due to higher average life spans in females, the proportion of female patients in higher age groups affected by a particular condition tends to be higher. Analyzing sex differences in prevalence for specific conditions would require stratifying by hundreds of different conditions, thus resulting in a loss of statistical power of the present study. It is not evident that larger categories, such as the 25 created by clinicaltrials.gov, or those that we may define ourselves, such as cardiovascular disease, have prevalence rates that are differential between men and women. We recognize that study enrollment should reflect the prevalence of the condition being studied. Unfortunately, this analysis was beyond the scope of the present study, but represents the next step with future studies regarding sex biases in clinical research.\nOur study also does not allow for an analysis of sex bias in clinical trials evaluating pharmaceuticals versus devices, which may be of interest to many readers. The FDA sets forth clear guidelines regarding what constitutes a medical device for regulatory pathway purposes. 21 In the present work, only 48/1,501 trials or *3.2% of total trials pertained to devices, whereas 93.4% of all trials studied a drug/pharmacologic intervention. The remaining 3.3% of trials consisted of other end points including but not limited to psychosocial intervention or lifestyle modification. There were a total of 3,468 subjects among those 48 trials, of which 48.3% were male and 51.7% were female. Given the extremely small sample size for device based clinical trials we felt that a comparison of sex bias in enrollment seen in pharmacologic studies versus device-base studies would not be adequately powered and would not lead to meaningful conclusions. We believe that a larger study looking at many years of data is needed to generate enough power to make this comparison, and this is definitely a topic for future investigation.\nThe blanket exclusion of all women of childbearing potential in the past was partially responsible for a dearth of clinical data that could be truly extrapolated in women. Finding the balance between ridding clinical research of sex bias while not doing harm to a woman or future children and/or childbearing abilities is difficult and demands an exhaustive analysis of risks and benefits. Informed consent, important in any study enrollment process, becomes extremely critical in this scenario. Perhaps the most clinically relevant scenario is one in which a study participant is not aware of their pregnancy and subsequently enrolls in a clinical trial which may put the fetus or pregnancy at risk. Most studies now include routine pregnancy tests as a part of the enrollment process. 22 As such, it may be appropriate to exclude pregnant women from a subset of studies. This should be carefully evaluated on a study-by-study basis and not used as a general rule.\nThere has been some consideration given in the literature to the role of risk aversion in females versus males and the possible impact this could have on attempts to equalize clinical trial recruitment. Objective data analyzing differences in risk aversion between sexes, especially as it pertains to clinical trial enrollment, are limited in the literature. We can draw on insights from the economics and business management realm where sex differences in risk aversion have been studied at length. Borghans et al. published an article for the National Bureau of Economic Research based on experimental exercises, intelligence quotient (IQ) testing, and psychological testing conducted on high school students, concluding that females are more ''ambiguity averse'' than males. 23 In contrast, Nelson in the article ''Are Women Really More Risk-Averse than Men?'' brings to question the methodology used in many of these studies. 24 Ultimately, the matter of differential risk aversion between sexes is likely a subject that needs further objective study. We recognize that this may have an impact on trial enrollment; however, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the impact of differences in risk aversion with our current data. This is an inherent limitation of our study, as well as the current state of the literature regarding risk aversion differences. The presence of sex biases in clinical trials, as well as the clinical relevance of these biases, has been discussed in other articles, often with contradictory findings. Wallach et al. performed an analysis specifically looking at sex-based subgroup analyses in meta-analyses published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 25 They found that a very small percentage (*11%) of such analyses resulted in statistically significant sex interactions. When topics that had multiple pertinent randomized controlled trials demonstrated a significant sex interaction in the first clinical trial, this was never corroborated in subsequent clinical trials. In contrast, Philips et al. analyzed 57 randomized controlled trials and found that 43% of the studies had an over-representation of male subjects and that only 22% of studies analyzed sex/ gender differences. 26 This is in line with the findings of Mansukhani et al. who reported that only 23% of studies across five major surgical journals included a discussion of sex-based results and only 33% analyzed their data by sex. 19 Given the variability in the present literature, it is sometimes difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the current state of sex bias in clinical trials. While the clinical significance of a sex difference may vary by intervention or disease, if we as the medical community are not active in looking for these differences as we conduct our research, we will never be able to identify even those differences that do have a meaningful impact on patient care.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This study demonstrates that sex bias is prevalent in modern day interventional clinical trials.

However, clinical recommendations on how to identify, characterize and treat clinical depression are lacking. To address this gap, an expert panel was convened to systematically review the published literature and develop guidelines on the evaluation and management of perimenopausal depression. The areas addressed included: (1) epidemiology; (2) clinical presentation; (3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (4) effects of hormone therapy; and (5) efficacy of other therapies (e.g., psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). Overall, evidence generally suggests that most midlife women who experience a major depressive episode during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression. Midlife depression presents with classic depressive symptoms commonly in combination with menopause symptoms (i.e., vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance), and psychosocial challenges. Menopause symptoms complicate, co-occur, and overlap with the presentation of depression. Diagnosis involves identification of menopausal stage, assessment of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of the psychosocial factors common in midlife, differential diagnoses, and the use of validated screening instruments. Proven therapeutic options for depression (i.e., antidepressants, psychotherapy) are the front-line treatments for perimenopausal depression. Although estrogen therapy is not approved to treat perimenopausal depression, there is evidence that it has antidepressant effects in perimenopausal women, particularly those with concomitant vasomotor symptoms.

[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] The notion of a menopauseassociated depression, however, has been the focus of clinical and scientific debate for years. The lack of consensus on this issue has also led to a lack of clarity in how to evaluate and treat depression in women during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal period.\nTo address this gap and to provide guidelines for health care practitioners, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the National Network of Depression Centers Women and Mood Disorders Task Group (NNDC) collaborated to convene an 11-member expert panel to systematically review the scientific literature on depressive disorders and depressive symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and develop clinical guidelines. The panel addressed five topics pertaining to depressive symptoms and depressive disorders during the perimenopause, including: (1) epidemiology; (2) clinical presentation; (3) therapeutic effects of antidepressants; (4) effects of hormone therapy (HT); and (5) efficacy of other therapies (e.g., psychotherapy, exercise, and natural health products). This review did not focus on the mood benefits of HT and non-hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms (VMS), as these are covered in NAMS position statements. 10,11 General guidelines for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are available; 12 therefore, those issues are not covered here.

Each subgroup of experts reviewed the published literature (Medline/PubMed/PsychInfo/EMbase) for relevant clinical studies using select search terms (see each section below), then they wrote a summary of their literature review and drafted a set of clinical recommendations. These were shared with each panel member via email for feedback and each subgroup was assigned to carefully review one other topic area. The panel co-chairs (PM, SK) drafted a set of guidelines based on the literature reviews. Panel members vetted the guidelines and voted on a final set of recommendations. The preliminary guidelines were presented at the 2016 NAMS Annual Meeting and the 2017 World Congress on Women's Mental Health, and feedback from those presentations was incorporated into final vetting of the guidelines, including the addition of a section on Specific Populations to address issues related to depression, hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy and primary ovarian insufficiency.\nThe literature (English only) in each section was reviewed in a systematic manner for publications between 1980 and 2015. Each section included a search with the following terms containing the MeSH terms ''depression,'' ''depressed,'' ''depressive,'' ''anxiety,'' or ''mood'' in combination with the terms ''perimenopause,'' ''menopausal transition,'' ''menopause,'' ''menopausal,'' ''postmenopausal,'' ''premenopause,'' or ''midlife'' as well as additional terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria specific to that section. Additional search terms were used for each topic area including epidemiology (''epidemiology,'' ''prevalence,'' or ''risk''), clinical presentation (''symptoms,'' ''presentation,'' ''diagnosis,'' ''screening,'' ''scales,''), antidepressants (''antidepressant,'' ''SSRI,'' ''SNRI''), hormone therapy (estrogen therapy'', ''hormone therapy'', ''hormone replacement therapy'', ''estrogen,'' ''oestrogen,'' and ''estradiol.'') and other therapies (''psychotherapy'', ''electroconvulsive therapy,'' ''neuromodulation,'' ''transcranial magnetic stimulation,'' ''vagus nerve stimulation,'' ''deep brain stimulation,'' ''luminotherapy,'' ''bright light therapy,'' ''sleep deprivation,'' ''wake therapy,'' ''acupuncture,'' ''exercise,'' ''Hypericum perforatum,'' ''St. John's wort,'' ''Cimifuga racemosa,'' ''Black cohosh,'' ''S-adenosyl-Lmethionine,'' ''SAMe,'' ''phytoestrogens,'' ''ginseng,'' ''ginkgo biloba,'' ''folate,'' ''l-methylfolate,'' and ''omega 3 fatty acids''). Each of the three intervention sections included only those clinical trials that selectively enrolled women with clinical depression and excluded studies that examined mood benefits in non-depressed women.\nThe epidemiology section addressed the following three questions with systematic reviews: (1) In cross-sectional studies, what is the relationship between perimenopause stage and depressive symptoms? (2) In longitudinal studies, what is the relationship between perimenopause stage and depressive symptoms? (3) In longitudinal studies, what are the risk factors for depressive symptoms/disorder in perimenopause? Four inclusion criteria were applied: (1) community-dwelling samples, not clinical settings, (2) sample size \u2021200, with 50 or more in each menopause stage, (3) a standard depression inventory with a validated cutoff score to indicate ''depressive symptoms'' or the use of a structured clinical interview to indicate ''diagnosed depressive disorder,'' and (4) specification and application of standard criteria to determine menopause status (e.g., Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop Plus 10 [STRAW + 10] 13 or Study of Women's Health Across the Nation [SWAN] 14 criteria; specific criteria for irregularity, number of missed periods, last bleed). We use the definition of perimenopause from the STRAW +10 criteria, where perimenopause is defined as the early and late menopause transition stages as well as the early postmenopause. 13 Note that this definition differs from SWAN where perimenopause includes early and late perimenopause but not the postmenopause. Also, given that the SWAN provides the longest follow-up period-13 years of follow-up for a sample of women aged 42-52 years at baseline-it is important to recognize that this body of work includes women with a maximum age of 65 and is not meant to address the topic of geriatric depression. Additionally, the following two sections were added following feedback from NAMS: (4) ''Is hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy a risk factor for depressive symptoms/disorders?'' and (5) ''Is Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) linked to depression?''\nThe section on the presentation of depression addressed: (1) Is there a unique or characteristic clinical presentation of depressive disorders during the menopause transition? (2) How is depression diagnosed during the menopause transition? What is the differential diagnosis of depression during the menopausal transition? (3) What symptoms commonly co-occur with depression in midlife women? (4) What are the unique psychosocial challenges associated with the menopause transition that might contribute to depressive symptoms? and (5) What screening measures have been validated for assessing depression and depressive symptoms? Studies that were published in a peer-reviewed journal, published in the English language, and utilized a validated or standard screening scale to assess one or one or more of the following: (i) menopausal symptoms, (ii) psychological distress, (iii) depressive disorders, (iv) depressive symptoms, (v) mood symptoms, and (vi) quality of life during menopause, were included.\nThe section on antidepressants addressed four questions: (1) What are the therapeutic effects of antidepressants on major depressive episodes (MDE) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women? (2) Are there differences in efficacy between types of antidepressants in the treatment of peri-or postmenopausal women with MDD? (3) Does clinical response to antidepressants differ according to menopause status? (4) Does estrogen therapy improve antidepressant response in peri-or postmenopausal women with MDD? Only studies meeting the following criterion were included: The section on hormone therapy addressed the following questions: (1) Does HT have an effect on depressive disorders in perimenopausal women? (2) Does HT have an effect on depressive disorders in postmenopausal women? and (3) Does HT prevent depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition? The section was guided by a recent, comprehensive systematic review on the efficacy of estrogen-based interventions. 15 The following inclusion criteria were applied:\n(1) clinical administration of estrogen-based HT, and (2) assessment of mood symptoms/depression with standardized instruments. Nonintervention studies and studies using nonestrogen-based preparations or hormone-analogue agents (selective estrogen-receptor modulators [SERMs]) were excluded from further consideration. Additionally, following feedback from NAMS, a section on hormonal contraceptives for perimenopausal women was added.\nThe section on other therapies on depression addressed efficacy of treatment modalities in classes that include: (1) psychotherapies, (2) somatic/physical therapies (neuromodulatory treatments, light therapy, exercise), and (3) natural products (i.e., nutraceutical therapies and botanical/herbal therapies).", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Epidemiology of Depressive Symptoms and Depressive Disorders in Midlife Women", "text": "In cross-sectional studies, what is the relationship between perimenopause stage and depressive symptoms?\nNumerous cross-sectional studies have addressed whether perimenopausal women demonstrate a higher prevalence of or are at risk for depressive symptoms compared with premenopausal women (Table 1).

The analytic approach varied, with some studies reporting adjusted results and others unadjusted. Eight of the 12 studies included found that elevated depressive symptoms were significantly more prevalent in perimenopausal versus premenopausal women, and six of these were adjusted for covariates. [16][17][18][19][20] These studies suggest that 45% to 68% of perimenopausal women report elevated depressive symptoms compared with 28% to 31% of premenopausal women. 17,20 In early perimenopause, 28% to 47% of women reported elevated depressive symptoms 16,19 and the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in this stage was higher than in the premenopausal stage. In a large cohort of ethnically diverse women, early perimenopausal women showed a 1.74-fold increased odds of elevated depressive symptoms during early perimenopause 19 and among Hispanic women there was a 2.45-fold increased odds. 16 It is difficult to conclude whether women in the late-perimenopause stage demonstrate elevated depressive symptoms because of the two cross-sectional studies that specifically included this group of women, one included only 57 women in this stage 19 and the other only examined depressive symptoms continuously. 21 In longitudinal studies, what is the relationship between perimenopause stage and depressive symptoms?\nProspective longitudinal studies from three U.S. cohorts addressed whether the perimenopausal stage is a period of increased risk for both depressive symptoms and depressive disorders as measured by diagnostic clinical interviews (See Table 2). These cohorts include SWAN, 14,[22][23][24] the Penn Ovarian Aging Study (POAS), [25][26][27][28] and the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study. 29 Compared with cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies are more optimally designed to address the association between menopause transition stage and depression as well as the direction of the association. Sample sizes in longitudinal studies sizes ranged from 151 to 3,302 (median, 332), and median length of follow-up was 7 years (range, 3-15 years). Women across studies were ethnically diverse and primarily well educated. Of the 11 longitudinal studies reviewed, six (54%) suggest an increased risk of depressive symptoms during the transition, 14,24,26,27,29,30 with estimates of a 1.30 to 1.55 increased likelihood of depressive symptoms in the early transition and 1.71 to 2.89 increase in the late transition. 14,24,27 Two studies indicate that in women with no previous history of depression, 26,27,30 the transition poses a greater risk for elevated depressive symptoms than does remaining premenopausal, especially in those with a history of adverse life events 30 or vasomotor symptoms (VMS) during perimenopause. 30 Although the majority of studies focused on the menopausal transition, the POAS examined risk in relation to the final menstrual period (FMP). When a sizeable number of women reached postmenopause in the POAS, the risk of elevated depressive symptoms was significantly higher before the FMP with a lower risk after the FMP. 25 Whether women with greater racial and economic diversity show the same risk of MDD is unclear, as selection bias can affect estimates of new onset depression, particularly in studies selecting for women with no history of MDD. 31 Two longitudinal studies evaluated the risk of a MDE during the menopause transition using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (POAS) 27 or the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression (SWAN). 22 In adjusted analyses, the SWAN reported that women were two to four times more likely to experience a major depressive episode during the menopause transition and early postmenopause, whereas no increased risk was found during these periods in the POAS. 26,27 In the POAS, few women transitioned through late perimenopause and postmenopause, so there is greater confidence in findings related to the early perimenopause than later in the transition. 26,27 In SWAN, the women at greatest risk for MDE during the menopause transition and after were those with a history of MDD before midlife. 23,32 Indeed, the largest studies have not found that the risk of a MDD episode during the transition is increased when there is no prior history of MDD. 23 A longitudinal SWAN study compared risk factors for an MDD episode in 151 women with a history of MDD compared to 274 women without a history of MDD. 23 Women with a history of MDD had a higher risk of developing MDD during midlife compared with women without a history of MDD (59% vs. 28%). 23 Additionally the risk for MDD was higher in the peri-versus premenopausal stage only for women with a history of MDD. 23 Overall the elevated risk for MDD in the perimenopause compared to the premenopause was primarily seen among women with a history of MDD, with inconsistent evidence of an increased risk in women without MDD prior to midlife.", "n_publication_ref": 50, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "In longitudinal studies, what are the risk factors for depressive symptoms/disorders during the perimenopause?", "text": "Longitudinal studies from the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia revealed a wide range of risk factor domains for depressive symptoms and disorders (Table 3). These include demographic characteristics (financial problems; unemployment; being black, Hispanic, or Japanese; < 50 years old; low education); somatic symptoms (VMS, bothersome symptoms, sleep problems); health related issues (prior depression, poor self-rated health, prior premenstrual complaints, severe premenstrual syndrome, use of psychotropic medications, high body mass index, history of postpartum blues, nulliparity, current antidepressant use, smoking, history of anxiety, chronic medical condition, low role functioning due to physical problems); psychosocial factors (death of partner, major stressful life event, negative attitudes toward aging and menopause, daily hassles, low social support, high trait anxiety, few close friends, tendency to ruminate); and hormones (mean and variability in folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol, and mean inhibin). As shown in Table 3, the evidence of an association between VMS and depressed mood is inconsistent. In SWAN there is a strong association between VMS and elevated depressive symptoms 14 but only a borderline significant association ( p < 0.10) between frequent VMS and an MDD episode. 21 The POAS found the opposite pattern of results, with a significant association between VMS and MDE but not depressive symptoms. 27 Inconsistencies may be due to different definitions of VMS (e.g., any, \u20216 days/2 weeks) and to the way MDD was assessed. For VMS, the association is primarily with depressive symptoms, rather than MDD. Overall, multiple and varying exposures including socioeconomic, individual psychological and social characteristics, and health factors are associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms and MDD during the menopause transition.\nIs hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy a risk factor for depressive symptoms/disorders?\nStudies examining the association between depression and hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy have yielded mixed results. [33][34][35][36][37] In an early randomized trial of ET or ET plus androgen therapy in premenopausal women, depressive symptoms worsened immediately following hysterectomy with oophorectomy, and improved significantly more with ET or ET plus androgen therapy than placebo. 38 A recent meta-analysis of studies published before 2012 identified 22 studies acceptable for inclusion (maximum sample size = 1162 women; maximum follow-up = 12 years) and concluded that symptoms of depression were significantly reduced following hysterectomy. 33 However, the quantitative analyses combined postmenopausal women and women with oophorectomy, precluding consideration of the effects of estrogen withdrawal on depression in premenopausal women. Longitudinal studies since that time have revealed an elevated risk of depression following hysterectomy with and without ovarian conservation. 34,35 For example, a study of 5336 women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health found that the risk of elevated depressive symptoms was 20% higher in women with a hysterectomy and ovarian conservation and 44% higher in women with a hysterectomy without ovarian conservation compared to women without a hysterectomy. 35 Women on ET in that study reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than women not on ET. However, because this was not a randomized trial of ET, this association might not reflect a causal effect of ET on depression but instead might indicate that HT was prescribed to treat depressive symptoms, although their depressive symptoms persisted. A population-based study of 8,441 Taiwanese women followed for up to 10 years revealed that compared to women without a hysterectomy, those with a hysterectomy had a 78% higher risk of elevated depressive symptoms and an 84% risk of MDD. 34 Is Premature Ovarian Insufficiency linked to depression?\nPremature ovarian insufficiency or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a clinical syndrome defined by loss of ovarian activity before the age of 40 and affects 1% of women. 39 There are few studies examining the prevalence of depression in women with POI. The lifetime prevalence of PERIMENOPAUSAL DEPRESSION GUIDELINES depression was found to be significantly higher in women with spontaneous 46, XX POI (54.5%) compared with the general population (20%) and occurred as commonly before as after the onset of menstrual irregularity-a proxy for the early stages of ovarian insufficiency. 40 In addition to menopause symptoms, concerns about fertility and long-term health consequences are associated with reduced psychological wellbeing in women with POI. 41,42 Clinical Presentation of Depression\nIs there a unique or characteristic clinical presentation of depressive disorders during the menopause transition?\nDepression during midlife, presents with classic depressive symptoms, commonly in combination with menopausespecific symptoms and psychosocial challenges. The menopause transition and early postmenopausal stage are reproductive stages associated with increased risk for MDE 22 and are also transient windows of vulnerability for the development of subthreshold depressive symptoms. 26,27,29,30,43,44 The menopause transition generally spans 4 to 8 years; however, the onset of the menopause transition, compared with other reproductive transitions, is less distinct and reflects underlying hormone changes that precede the clinical markers by a variable period of time. 45 Difficulties in establishing the temporal association of the onset of mood changes with the menstrual markers of the menopause transition may partly explain the relative paucity of data describing unique presentations of clinical depression during and after the menopause transition. 46 In addition, although major strides have been made to ensure standardization, historically there has been a lack of consistency in defining depression during the menopause transition, distinguishing the severities of depression at this stage and using uniform rating tools. 47 How is depression diagnosed during the menopause transition?\nComprehensive diagnosis of depressive disorders during midlife may involve an identification of the stage of menopause as well as clinical assessment of depressive symptoms and other psychiatric conditions. The differential diagnosis of depression during the menopause transition and after surgical menopause includes MDD, subsyndromal depression, adjustment disorder, psychological distress, bereavement, bipolar depression, and general medical causes of depression. Most women who experience a MDE during the menopause transition have had a history of MDD; therefore, the episode represents recurrence of their illness. 23 First lifetime onset of MDD during the menopause transition is less common. 23 During the menopause transition and postmenopause, a woman may experience more losses compared with previous stages of her life. Similarly, she may also experience life stressors unique to her midlife stage (e.g., caring for aging parents, sometimes while caring for children; career shifts); hence, bereavement and adjustment disorder are important to consider in the differential diagnosis.\nSome women also may experience psychological distress related to awareness of aging, body changes associated with reproductive aging, and concurrent health conditions. 48 Although surgical menopause may present concerns about fertility and premature aging, data surrounding surgical menopause's association with increased or decreased risk of psychological distress are largely mixed. 49 Psychological distress is to be differentiated from subsyndromal or minor depression. 50 Minor depression is characterized by exhibiting two to four symptoms of a MDE, including dysphoria or anhedonia, with associated distress and/or functional impairment.\nMood swings are also common during the menopause transition. 51 Previous psychiatric history, collateral, and careful delineation of symptoms may assist in differentiating mood swings commonly experienced during the menopause transition from a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Prospective studies have demonstrated an increased likelihood of mood exacerbation (mood depression as well as elevation) in those with a history of bipolar disorder during the late menopause transition and early postmenopause. 52 What symptoms commonly co-occur with depression in midlife women?\nSeveral common symptoms of the menopause transition and natural or surgical postmenopause (VMS, sleep and sexual disturbances, weight/energy changes, cognitive shifts, and urinary symptoms) co-occur and overlap with the presentation of depression during this stage. 53 Depression itself may present with sleep, sexual, appetite, energy, and concentration difficulties. VMS and sleep disturbance are especially common and can be severe after surgical menopause. 54,55 An evaluation of the co-occurrence of depressive symptoms and menopausal symptoms was performed via cluster analysis in a sample of 797 women with no history of MDD who were participating in the MSFlash trials. 56 At baseline, there were two symptom clusters that included women with elevated depressive symptoms. In one cluster (14% of the total sample), elevated depressive symptoms were clustered with high levels of insomnia, very low sleep quality and moderately high VMS. In a smaller cluster (7% of the total sample), elevated depressive symptoms were clustered with elevated anxiety but minimally with other symptoms. In the cluster characterized by the highest level of VMS (11% of the sample), depressive symptoms were low, indicating that depressive symptoms are not uniformly present, even when VMS are severe.\nBecause these same symptoms also may be secondary to menopause, it becomes difficult to parse out contributing etiologies, relative contributions of each etiology, and potential additive effects. 53,57 In addition, symptoms unique to the menopause transition and postmenopause, including VMS and vaginal dryness, have the potential to magnify or complicate individual symptoms and global clinical experience of depressive disorders during this stage. 58 Furthermore, depression may affect an individual's appraisal of the degree of bother from somatic symptoms commonly encountered during the menopause transition; thereby, further magnifying the effect of symptoms on quality of life. 59 Vasomotor symptoms and sleep. The interrelationship between depressive symptoms, VMS, and sleep disturbances has been studied. The domino theory asserts that night sweats may be causally related to sleep disturbances that, in turn, are causally related to depressive symptoms. 60 Subsequent studies have supported some aspects of this theory and questioned others. 61 A study examining the effect of VMS on PERIMENOPAUSAL DEPRESSION GUIDELINES 123 sleep via induction by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist demonstrated a causal relationship between VMS and difficulty sleeping. 62 In the POAS cohort, where all women were premenopausal at baseline, depressive symptoms were more likely to precede VMS in the menopause transition among women who had no experience of either symptom prior to the transition, findings that challenge the causal relationships of the domino theory as a universal explanation of the association between these symptoms. 63 Experimental studies examining the relationship of mood with concurrent VMS and sleep disturbance have used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to induce symptoms in healthy non-depressed women 64 and, separately, have randomized women with a MDE to estrogen therapy or placebo. 65,66 These studies have shown that for women without MDE, emergence of depressive symptoms on gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists is linked with emergence of sleep disturbance, specifically sleep interruption, and with onset of nocturnal VMS, but not daytime VMS. 64 In contrast, among women with MDE randomized to estrogen therapy, depressive symptoms improve in concert with improvement in sleep disturbance, but not in association with VMS. 66 Epidemiologic studies have similarly shown that VMS are linked with risk of developing subsequent depressive symptoms, 24,26,65,66 but not MDE, 23,26 although there is a statistical trend toward an association of VMS with subsequent emergence of first lifetime onset of MDD in SWAN 23 and an early POAS study showed a significant association between VMS and new MDD onset. 27 Taken together, these experimental and epidemiologic studies provide evidence that the relationship between depressive symptoms and VMS differs between those with and without MDE, with associations observed almost exclusively among those without MDE. 67 Sleep disturbance has been linked with depression in midlife women. In women with VMS, the sleep characteristics that distinguish those with versus those without a depressive disorder include prolonged sleep-onset latency, reduced perceived quality of sleep, sleep efficiency, and overall total sleep duration. 61 On the basis of these studies, it appears that VMS are causally related to difficulty sleeping. Difficulty sleeping, in turn, appears to be associated with depressive symptoms. 64,66 Symptoms characteristic of the menopause transition and early natural or surgical postmenopause may overlap and compound symptoms common to depression.\nCognition: Depression and menopause itself may exert effects on concentration, thereby making it difficult to disentangle individual contributions. 53,57 Subjective complaints of cognitive changes are common during the menopause transition; longitudinal studies from SWAN provide some objective validation to the subjective complaints because they demonstrate a transient impairment in learning during the menopause transition. 68 Concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with slower processing speed and anxiety was also associated with worse memory, but no symptom accounted for lower performance in late perimenopause compared to premenopause. 69 Consistent with SWAN, the POAS demonstrated a decrease in learning and memory as women transitioned through the menopause even after accounting for age, depression, anxiety and other factors that can influence cognition. 70 Midlife women with depression may also present with co-occurring cognitive slowing and deficits in encoding and thus have the potential of amplifying existing cognitive changes during the menopause transition. 69,71 Fatigue: In addition, selected neurovegetative features of depression (decreased energy, increased appetite) may overlap with and compound subjective complaints of fatigue as well as weight increases commonly reported during and after the menopause transition. 72 Sexual function: Genitourinary changes accompanying menopause may affect sexual function and desire. 73 Decreased libido also may be a symptom of depression. 74 The dual effect of depression and the menopause transition on sexual desire and performance may be additive, 75 an effect that may be especially true for surgical menopause. 76,77 Urinary incontinence: There is a small and inconsistent literature suggesting a bidirectional association between urinary incontinence and depression in midlife women. Prospective cohort studies have found depressive symptoms to be a risk factor for persistent urinary incontinence. 78,79 Other cross-sectional studies have reported that postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence are more likely to have depressive and anxiety symptoms. 80 In contrast, several other studies have not observed a clear link between depression and urinary incontinence in midlife women with depression. 22,23 The basis for this potential association is not understood but might be related to decreased serotonin levels in the central nervous system that have been correlated with increased urinary frequency and bladder contractions. 81,82 What are the unique psychosocial challenges associated with the menopause transition that might contribute to depressive symptoms?\nThe psychosocial factors observed during the menopause transition and postmenopause may be unique to midlife. Older studies posit that depressive symptoms, previously termed ''involutional melancholia,'' 83 arose from an ''empty nest'' phenomenon; namely, that women may be prone to depressive symptoms when children leave the home. 84 This theory has since been refuted with empiric data which suggest an improvement in wellbeing in women when children leave the home and no effect of the return of adult children (''revolving door'') on mood. 85 Nonetheless, menopause may represent a uniquely challenging time for women. Many women face a series of stressors including but not exclusive to caring for aging parents, death of parents, medical illness in self and family, adjusting to emotional and physical sequelae of surgical menopause and other health issues that are common to this stage of life, children leaving the home, and changes in marital status. With the onset of childbirth at an increasingly later age, women are often faced with the dual responsibility of raising young children amid caring for aging parents while navigating their careers and ensuing challenges. These multiple demands are often faced without supports in place to identify or address the ensuing distress placed on a woman during this stage.", "n_publication_ref": 89, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "What screening measures have been validated for assessing depression and depressive symptoms?", "text": "Several general validated screening measures for clinical settings, including but not exclusive to the PHQ-9, may be used for categorical determination of mood disorder diagnoses during the menopause transition as they are in other populations. In research settings, questionnaires such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), as well as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self- Report, also may be helpful in capturing symptom severity and are predictive albeit not diagnostic of MDD during midlife. 86,87 It is important to note that several symptoms common to the menopause transition (VMS, cognitive changes, sleep disturbances) may affect scoring. 57 The HDRS is also commonly used in research studies, and is clinician administered. 88 A menopause-specific mood disorder scale does not yet exist, but other menopause-specific validated symptom and qualityof-life (QOL) scales measuring more general parameters may be useful. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) incorporates a range of perimenopause measures including but not exclusive to mood, libido, and vaginal dryness. 89 The Menopause-Specific Quality-of-Life Scale (MENQOL) assesses and identifies psychological and somatic parameters that affect QOL during the menopause transition. 90 Other commonly used scales include the Greene Climacteric Scale and the Utian Quality-of-Life Scale. 91,92 Although these scales address domains of psychiatric symptoms, they do not distinguish distress from major depression or subsyndromal depression. Moreover, they also do not necessarily capture the duration of symptoms or the effect of mood disturbance on function. 89,90 ", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Therapeutic Effects of Antidepressant Medications on Clinical Depression in Peri-and Postmenopausal Women", "text": "What are the therapeutic effects of antidepressants on MDE in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women?\nTwo large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examined the efficacy of desvenlafaxine for MDD in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women defined using STRAW criteria (see Table 4). 93,94 Short-term treatment with 50 mg and 100-200 mg doses of desvenlafaxine led to significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo. 93,94 Post-hoc analyses of pooled data from these trials showed significant improvement with desvenlafaxine in both the perimenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups, including lower symptom burden and higher remission rates. 95,96 To date, no other antidepressants have been studied in large randomized placebo-controlled trials of well-defined perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with MDD. There have been a number of small open-label studies of other antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, vortioxetine), serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; venlafaxine, duloxetine) and mirtazapine to treat MDD in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women that have demonstrated a positive effect on mood as well as VMS, sleep, anxiety, and pain. [97][98][99][100][101][102][103] Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), is sometimes prescribed alone or in combination with an SSRI/SNRI to perimenopausal women because it does not lead to as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness as SSRI/SNRIs. 104 However, there are no RCTs of buproprion in perimenopausal women.\nAre there differences in efficacy between types of antidepressants in the treatment of perior postmenopausal women with MDD?\nA large randomized double-blind trial compared the SNRI desvenlafaxine and the SSRI escitalopram on MDD in postmenopausal women defined using STRAW criteria; no significant difference in efficacy was seen after 8 weeks of acute phase treatment nor after 6 months of continuation phase treatment (see Table 4). 105 These findings were in contrast to a previous analysis of a large pooled dataset by sex and age (using a cutoff of 50) comparing remission rates with venlafaxine, SSRIs, or placebo that found a significant advantage in remission rates favoring the SNRI venlafaxine over SSRIs in older women. 106 Another post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data using age-defined menopause status showed no difference in the efficacy of the SNRI venlafaxine versus the SSRI fluoxetine in younger or older women. 107 Similarly, a pooled analysis of open-label trials showed no differences in response rates to reboxetine, sertraline, or venlafaxine in older and younger women. 108 Some studies have noted a superior effect of an SSRI over a tricyclic or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) in premenopausal women, but no such differences were found in postmenopausal women in those studies.

These cognitive techniques are paired with behavioral interventions to combat passive disengagement from life activities. CBT has been shown to be effective for reducing symptoms of depression, preventing depressive relapses in the general population, 137 and treating depressive symptoms in primary care settings. 138 Practice guidelines have preferentially recommended antidepressant pharmacotherapy over psychotherapy for severe episodes of depression in general adult populations; however, recent evidence suggests that baseline depression severity may not moderate differences in antidepressant efficacy between CBT and antidepressant pharmacotherapy for adults with depression. 139 Combining CBT and antidepressant pharmacotherapy may be more effective for reducing depressive symptoms, improving recovery rates, and increasing adherence to treatment than medication alone. 140 CBT also appears to be as effective as continuing antidepressant treatment for preventing relapses. 141 Two clinical trials provide initial evidence that CBT improves depression related to the menopause. In the first study, 44 women outpatients (mean age = 49 years, 52% perimenopausal, 48% premenopausal) who were not taking HT were randomly assigned to receive twice-weekly group CBT (16 sessions) or an undefined control condition. 142 Group CBT, but not the control condition, led to a significant improvement in depressive symptoms (BDI) from baseline.

In a second study, individual CBT (16 sessions) was delivered to 353 women (mean age = 42 years) who were not taking or were withdrawn from psychotropic medication. 143 Classification of menopausal stage was defined according to non-validated criteria with 169 classified as premenopausal, 76 as perimenopausal based on age range (42-51.5 years) and at least one menstrual period reported within the year before trial entry, and the remaining 108 participants as postmenopausal. Overall, 93 participants (55%) showed a positive treatment response defined as 50% or greater improvement in depressive symptoms (HDRS) from baseline, and rates did not differ by menopause status. Twenty (26%) perimenopausal and 30 (28%) postmenopausal participants achieved depressive symptom remission, defined as a HDRS total score 6 or less at study exit.\nThere is preliminary support that the core elements of CBT that have been shown to be efficacious in depression treatment in the general population may also apply to patients with depression related to the menopause transition. However, the lack of appropriate control conditions and lack of standardized criteria to define menopausal stage limit the data quality. Large, randomized trials of CBT specifically designed for women with depression related to menopause transition are needed. However, given the strong evidence base supporting individual or group CBT for depression in the general population, the relatively low risk of harms, and the preliminary evidence supporting these interventions in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, CBT is a reasonable option for treatment of depression related to the menopause transition.\nWhat therapies are effective for depression in general but have not been studied in the menopause?\nSeveral therapies are recommended for depression in general but have not been studied in the menopause. These include the psychotherapies interpersonal therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Therapies recommended for treatment-resistant depression that have not been studied specifically for menopause-related depression include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation. Similarly, light therapy for patients with seasonal affective disorder has not been studied specifically for women in the menopause transition. A Cochrane meta-analysis of clinical trials of exercise for the treatment of MDD in adults over 18 found that exercise reduces depression symptoms, but in high-quality studies, exercise confers only small benefits. 144 A meta-analysis of clinical trials of exercise for depressive symptoms in midlife and older women without MDD found that exercise improved depressive symptoms. 145 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Summary and Guidelines", "text": "On the basis of the data, the expert panel makes the following recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of depression during the menopause transition.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Epidemiology", "text": "The perimenopause is a window of vulnerability for the development of both depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes. The risk of depressive symptoms is elevated during the perimenopause even in women with no history of major depressive disorder. Most midlife women who experience a MDE during the perimenopause have experienced a prior episode of depression; therefore, the episode represents recurrence of their illness. First lifetime onset of MDD during this time is less common. Data are mixed about whether women who undergo surgical menopause are at increased or decreased risk for developing depression compared with women who transition through menopause naturally. However, recent large-scale studies show an elevated risk of depression in women following hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency also have shown elevated rates of depression. Risk factors for depressive symptoms during the perimenopause include prior MDD, sociodemographic factors (e.g., younger age, black race, financial difficulties), psychosocial factors (adverse life events, low social support), menopause symptoms (VMS, sleep disturbance), anxiety symptoms, and reproductiverelated mood disturbance (e.g., postpartum and/or premenstrual depressive symptoms). Risk factors for MDD during the perimenopause include mental health factors (prior MDD, current use of antidepressants, anxiety, trait anxiety, premenstrual depressive symptoms), sociodemographic factors (black race, high BMI, younger age), psychosocial factors (upsetting life events, social isolation), and menopausal symptoms (especially sleep disturbance).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Clinical presentation", "text": "Depression during midlife presents with classic depressive symptoms, commonly in combination with menopause-specific symptoms (i.e., VMS, sleep disturbance) and psychosocial challenges.

Vasomotor symptoms are associated with depressive symptoms but not MDEs, except in women with first lifetime onset of a depressive episode during the perimenopause.

The differential diagnosis of depression during the perimenopause includes MDD, subsyndromal depression, adjustment disorder, psychological distress, bereavement, depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, and general medical causes of depression. A menopause-specific mood-disorder scale does not exist; however, several general validated screening measures (e.g., PHQ-9) may be used for categorical determination of mood disorder diagnoses.

In women with a history of MDD, a prior adequate response to a particular antidepressant should guide treatment selection when MDD recurs during midlife years. Only desvenlafaxine has been studied and proven efficacious in large randomized placebo-controlled trials of welldefined peri-and postmenopausal depressed women.\nSelection of antidepressants during the perimenopause should consider the woman's prior antidepressant trials and responses, available data on efficacy and tolerability in this specific population, management of challenging adverse effects (e.g., sexual dysfunction, weight changes) and safety (e.g., drug-drug interactions), given the likelihood of concomitant use of other medications during this stage of life. In addition to their efficacy in treating MDD, many antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) also improve menopause-related complaints (e.g., VMS, pain).

There is some evidence that ET enhances mood and improves well-being in non-depressed perimenopausal women. Hormonal contraceptives-particularly when used continuously-have shown some benefits for mood regulation and may improve depressive symptoms in women approaching menopause. Transdermal estradiol with intermittent micronized progesterone may prevent the onset of depressive symptoms in euthymic perimenopausal women, but the evidence is not sufficient to recommend estrogen-based therapies for preventing depression in asymptomatic peri-or postmenopausal women and the risks and benefits must be weighed. Estrogen-based therapies may augment clinical response to antidepressants in midlife and older women but their use should be considered with caution (i.e., preferably when also indicated for other concurrent conditions such as VMS).

The objective of this review was to examine published endometrial cancer rates and potential etiologies. Methods: Endometrial cancer incidence was obtained from the SEER Program database from 1975 through 2014, and a test for trend in incidence was calculated. Changes in risk factors thought to be associated with endometrial cancer, including age, obesity, diabetes, diet and exercise, reproductive factors, and medications (hormone therapy [HT]  including Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved and non-FDA-approved [compounded] estrogens and progestogens, tamoxifen, and hormonal contraceptives) were found through PubMed searches. Temporal trends of risk factors were compared with endometrial cancer trends from SEER. Results: Although endometrial cancer rates were constant from 1992 to 2002 (women 50-74 years of age), they increased 2.5% annually with a 10% increase from 2006 to 2012 (trend test 0.82). Use of approved prescription estrogen-progestogen combination products decreased after the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data, whereas other risk factors either remained constant or decreased during the same time; however, compounded bioidentical HT (CBHT) use increased coincident with the endometrial cancer increase. Conclusion: Endometrial cancer rate increases after the first publication of WHI data in 2002 may be associated with the decreased use of approved estrogen-progestogen therapy, the increase in CBHT use, and the prevalence of obesity and diabetes; potential relationships require further evaluation.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I n the United States, uterine cancer is the fourth leading cancer among women, representing 7% of all new cancer cases. 1 In 2017, *61,000 new uterine cancer diagnoses were estimated and nearly 11,000 women were estimated to die from the disease, primarily affecting postmenopausal women (mean age of diagnosis, 62 years). 2 The greatest percentage of new cases by age from 2010 to 2014 was detected in women around and after menopausal age (16.7% for 45-54 years of age, 34.5% for 55-64 years, and 25.8% for 65-74 years). 2 The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute collects and pub-lishes cancer incidence and survival data from populationbased cancer registries covering *28% of the U.S. population. 3 Data from SEER show variable increases in endometrial cancer incidence over time, with sharper incident increases in black women compared with white women. 4 Another report found the incidence to increase over time in women 50-74 years of age (annual percentage change 2004-2009: 2.8%; 2005-2009: 3.3%; and 2006-2009: 4.2%), 5 after publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data. 6 When the balance of progesterone and estrogen shifts at the time of menopause, with a decrease in progesterone production, even small amounts of circulating estrogens may not be adequately counterbalanced, and can lead to the thickening of the endometrium and potential subsequent endometrial cancer. 7 Several studies have demonstrated that unopposed estrogen therapy increased the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, whereas the addition of a progestogen prevents such risk. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] In addition to the use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT), a number of factors may influence a woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer, including certain medications, obesity, diabetes, reproductive factors, and diet and exercise. 7 In this study, using publicly available cancer incidence statistics in SEER, we review and quantitatively describe the trend of endometrial cancer incidence in recent years.

Increased risk for endometrial cancer was unequivocally shown in earlier studies of unopposed oral estrogen. [16][17][18][19] A rising incidence of endometrial cancer was also reported after estrogen therapy first became commonly used to treat menopausal symptoms and as use increased in the 1970s. 20 Early data also showed that addition of a pro-gestogen prevented the increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogens. 18,19 Later studies confirmed this association, 11,21 including data from the WHI showing a decrease in endometrial cancer with continuous estrogen plus progestogen compared with placebo. 22 Currently, women with a uterus taking systemic estrogens (oral/transdermal) are to be prescribed a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, and the potential for subsequent endometrial cancer. 23 After the first publication of the WHI findings, 6 prescriptions of FDA-approved HT significantly decreased among postmenopausal women. 24,25 Before the WHI publication, annual HT use had increased from 58 million prescriptions in 1995 to 90 million prescriptions in 1999 and remained stable through June 2002. 26 Within 1 year of the WHI publication, use of prescribed HT sharply declined to the levels of 1995, 26 and continued to decline until 2009 (Fig. 2). 25 The authors of one study suggest that the increased incidence of endometrial cancer observed after 2002 may possibly be linked to the decreased use of menopausal HT with a progestogen. 5 Increase in FDA-approved vaginal estrogens. Medical societies have suggested that the use of a progestogen is not always required with vaginal estrogens as local vaginal estrogen use has not been associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer, [27][28][29][30] and does not result in endometrial hyperplasia rates as reported for systemic unopposed estrogens. However, large long-term studies of vaginal estrogens are lacking. Although use of vaginal estrogens almost doubled from 2000 to 2009 (Fig. 2) and later decreased from 2011 through 2015, 25,31 clinical trials and observational studies of vaginal estrogen use have not found an association with endometrial cancer. [27][28][29][30]32 Therefore, it is unlikely that vaginal estrogens contribute to the increase in endometrial cancer observed between 2002 and 2009.\nIncrease in compounded bioidentical HT. Compounded bioidentical HT (CBHT), which is not FDA-approved and is inadequately regulated by the FDA, is another form of menopausal HT. Clinicians have noticed a precipitous increase in the use of CBHT since the publication of the WHI findings, although quantifying that increase has been challenging since CBHT use is not systematically tracked and available material on the magnitude of its use is limited. [33][34][35] However, some recent publications have estimated CBHT use and have reported an increase in its use. Two smaller surveys (n = 160 responders in each) by the same authors showed an increase of 23% in any compounding prescription from 2005 to 2006. 36,37 In a 2012-2013 analysis of a large national prescription claims database (>22 million members), a 27% increase in the use of any compounded medication and a 34% increase in claims for the same were observed from 2012 to 2013, and CBHT was the most commonly compounded therapy among women aged 40-69 years, with this gender and age group using compounded therapies most frequently. 38 A 2014 survey of compounding and independent community pharmacists reported that their compounding business had grown or stayed the same in the past 2 years, and most expected continued growth, anticipating 5%-25% growth of CBHT use over the next 2 years. 39 A study, based on two surveys conducted in 2013 and 2014, estimated that 1-2.5 million women older than 40 years of age may be using CBHT a year (an estimated 21-39 million prescriptions). 40 Finally, a 2015 North American Menopause Society survey reported that 35% of U.S. women currently using HT (and 41% of ever users aged 40-49 years) are using CBHT. 41 The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with CBHT has not been rigorously studied as with FDA-approved HTs. The levels of progesterone in CBHT, as in any HT, must be high enough to counter any endometrial stimulation by estrogens. Some cases of endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia, [41][42][43][44] as well as higher rates of vaginal bleeding, 41 have been reported among healthy CBHT users.\nThe increase in CBHT use is consistent with the increased incidence of endometrial cancer after the WHI in 2002, implicating a potential role for CBHT in this endometrial cancer increase.", "n_publication_ref": 43, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Obesity", "text": "Obesity may account for up to 40% of the observed endometrial cancer incidence, with obese women having a twofold to fivefold increased risk of developing endometrial cancer compared with normal weight women.

In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u202130 kg/m 2 ) in women remained stable from 1960 and 1980, which was followed by a sharp increase between 1980 and 1999 (Fig. 3). 50 From 1999 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity increased among all women, including women who were 45-64 and \u202165 years 51 ; however, this increase was minimal and of smaller magnitude compared with the increase in endometrial cancer.

The age of menarche has remained relatively the same over the past 40 years in the Unites States, although the age of thelarche seems to be occurring earlier. 58,59 Data from the 2012 American Community Survey and Birth Record Data from Vital Statistics show that although the number of children born per woman decreased between 1976 and 1992, the rate remained fairly uniform between 1992 and 2012. 60 Use of oral contraceptives reported by the National Survey of Family Growth also shows fairly constant use between 1982 and 2008, with rates of 15.6% in 1982, 17.3% in 1995, 18.9% in 2002, and 17.3% between 2006 and 2008. 61 A later analysis of this database showed no significant change in the prevalence of oral contraceptive use from 2008 to 2014. 62 Despite this stable prevalence, a change in oral contraceptive formulations resulting in lower progesterone relative to estrogen could potentially increase endometrial cancer risk. However, the dominant trend in formulation changes for oral contraceptives has been a decrease in estrogen rather than a decrease in progesterone. Furthermore, oral contraceptives are well known to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, with risk reduction that increases with duration of use and persists up to 30 years after their discontinuation. [63][64][65] Intrauterine devices (IUDs) were shown to have a protective effect against endometrial cancer, which is increased with duration of use, and sustained up to 5 years after cessation of use. 66,67 National Survey of Family Growth data have shown a high increase in the popularity of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs; IUDs and implants) in women aged 15-44 years between 1982 and 2013. 68 Usage of LARCs was constant between 1998 and 2002 (1.5%); current LARC use then doubled in 2006-2010 (3.8%) and then nearly doubled for 2011-2013 (7.2%). 68 No studies have yet reported whether newer types of IUDs that release progesterone have any effect on endometrial cancer risk; however, these IUDs are sometimes used to treat precancers and early endometrial cancers. 69 Based on the described trends, reproductive factors do not appear to be major contributors to the increase of endometrial cancer incidence after WHI.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Cancer and cancer-related treatments", "text": "Although rare, there are certain types of cancers that have estrogen-secreting capabilities and may contribute to endometrial tissue stimulation. Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary represent *5% of all ovarian malignancies, and adult GCTs occur primarily in perimenopausal or early postmenopausal women. 70 Evidence suggests that GCTs secrete increased levels of estradiol, and elevated estradiol serum levels may be responsible for disease progression and clinical manifestations of other diseases. 70 Nevertheless, in addition to the low occurrence of GCTs of the ovary, there has been an overall decrease in invasive ovarian cancer in women \u202165 years from 52.5% in 1998 to 41.6% in 2014, 71 suggesting that this risk factor would not contribute to the observed increase in endometrial cancer incidence.\nCancer-related treatments, such as the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, may also affect endometrial cancer risk. Although effective in reducing breast cancer incidence by acting as an antiestrogen in breast tissue, evidence suggests that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen in the uterus and increases endometrial cancers. 7,72 Despite the increased risk of tamoxifen use with endometrial cancer, tamoxifen use has decreased since 2000 and thus is unlikely to be a significant risk factor. 73 ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Exercise", "text": "Epidemiological evidence has shown that physical activity can lower the risk of endometrial cancer by 20%-40% compared with physical inactivity.

As reviewed here and as suggested by others, changes in the prevalence of known endometrial cancer risk factors seemed unlikely to account for the increase in endometrial cancer incidence. 5 Our data review demonstrates a decrease in the use of FDA-approved estrogen plus progestogen HT (known to protect the endometrium), which has been shown to be associated with an increase in endometrial cancer risk. Thus, this decrease may be a contributing factor to the increased endometrial cancer incidence after the WHI. Similarly, the increase in CBHT use may also increase the incidence of endometrial cancer, with obesity and diabetes contributing to the increase in incidence but likely to a much lesser degree.\nUnlike manufactured FDA-approved HT, 40,41 CBHT is not approved nor regulated by the FDA and, therefore, does not carry the safety warnings mandated for all HTs by the FDA after the WHI. 78 Since it also lacks standard guidelines set forth by the FDA, under-and overdosage of CBHT are possible due to its inconsistent bioavailability and bioactivity. 35 The variability in purity and quality of progesterone products was examined and two out of five progesterone samples (40%) tested failed repeat potency testing and one sample (20%) failed uniformity testing (consistent dosages), leading to underdosing with progesterone. 79 Another sampling of compounded progesterone vaginal suppositories from 10 randomly chosen pharmacies found that half (5/10) of the pharmacies provided product that was subpotent or superpotent (outside of the 90%-110% acceptable range). 80 Similarly, CBHT prescriptions from 12 sources had superpotent estradiol or estrone (up to >250%) and subpotent progesterone (60%-80%) in a small investigation by one physician. 81 Although we cannot be certain that these small studies of CBHT potency are representative of most CBHT being used, there is still cause for concern given the considerable risks: underdosing of progesterone and/or overdosing of estrogens could lead to an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, overdosing of estrogens to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and underdosing of estrogens to an increased risk of osteoporosis. 35 In addition, numerous claims regarding CBHT in comparison with FDA-approved HT products have been noted; however, none of them have been supported by scientific evidence, and clinicians should carefully consider each claim with caution before prescribing CBHT. 35,82,83 The lack of reliable placebo-or comparator-controlled studies evaluating CBHT makes it difficult to accurately assess CBHT efficacy or safety. As stated by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, CBHT poses additional risk to its users due to its variable purity, potency, and lack of efficacy and safety data 23,35,78,84 and, therefore, should be avoided unless medically indicated (dosing or formulation not available or allergy to FDA-approved products). 23 Patients and physicians should equally educate themselves on the risks and benefits of CBHT, and physicians should be cautious in prescribing CBHT due to the perceived risk of increasing endometrial cancer risk. Women currently taking CBHT should also receive regular endometrial surveillance as a safety precaution.\nIn conclusion, an increase in endometrial cancer incidence may be associated with a number of risk factors, including increased CBHT use, obesity, and diabetes, as well as decreased use of approved estrogen-progestogen HT. We believe that CBHT use to be the most likely significant risk factor for the observed increase in endometrial cancer post-WHI.

We extracted information from the health plans' administrative claims and electronic health record databases, tumor registries, and infants' birth certificate files to estimate the frequency and incidence of PAC, defined as cancer diagnosed during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. Results: We identified 846 PAC events among 775,709 pregnancies from 2001 to 2013. The overall incidence estimate was 109.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 101.8-116.7) per 100,000 pregnancies.

Although it is generally recognized that pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC) is a growing public health problem, 1-3 information on its frequency and incidence is scarce and outdated. The published incidence estimates of PAC vary from 17 to 137 per 100,000 pregnancies [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] and include only one population-based study from the United States, a study of women who gave birth in California. 7 More contemporary incidence estimates are needed to help guide the development of clinical and public health policies aimed at diagnosing cancers at an early stage and initiating appropriate therapeutic interventions in a timely manner. In this study, we estimated the frequency and incidence of PAC, defined as cancer diagnosed during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum, 5,7,9,10 during 2001-2013 within a large population-based cohort of pregnant women in the United States.\n(MEPREP). 12 The CRN is a National Cancer Institute-funded initiative to support and facilitate cancer research based on 14 U.S. not-for-profit health plans and healthcare delivery systems. MEPREP is a collaborative research program between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and 11 health plan-affiliated research institutions that enables the conduct of multicenter studies of medication use and outcomes in pregnancy. The five participating health plans in this study were Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, HealthPartners, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Together, these health plans provided care to over 6 million current enrollees within eight states.\nTo conduct population-based cancer research, each CRN site employs a distributed, standardized data model known as the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). 13,14 Briefly, the VDW is populated with patient-level data extracted from administrative claims and electronic health record databases. The VDW contains tumor registry, outpatient pharmacy dispensing, and procedure and diagnosis data associated with inpatient and outpatient encounters. The tumor registry file contains data consistent with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries standards. 15 Data are obtained from manual reviews of cancer patients' medical charts by trained abstractors and include coded clinical data associated with inpatient and outpatient events. MEPREP employs a common data model that is almost identical to the one used by CRN and includes two additional files-a mother-baby linkage file and a birth certificate file-created specifically for pregnancy research. Infant birth certificates provide information on sociodemographic, medical, and reproductive factors. Approximately 450,000 pregnancies that ended in live birth were linked to infant birth certificates from 2001 to 2008 in the five participating health plans. Linked birth certificate files were not available for pregnancies that occurred during 2009-2013.\nFor this study, we linked the VDW data from CRN sites with the mother-baby linkage and birth certificate files from MEPREP. We obtained information on maternal age, calendar year of pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome (live birth, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, and ectopic pregnancy) (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/jwh) from the health plans' administrative claims data; information on maternal race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, plurality, gravidity, gestational age, and birth weight from the birth certificate file (whenever available); and information on cancer diagnosis and tumor site from the tumor registry file. The source population for the current study included all women with a clinically recognized pregnancy between 2001 and 2013. To be eligible, the women had to be 10-54 years of age at the end of pregnancy and continuously enrolled in the health plan 90 days before and during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Identification of pregnancy and trimesters of pregnancy", "text": "We identified live-born deliveries, stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, and ectopic pregnancies in the health plan data using previously validated algorithms. 16,17 Briefly, the algorithms searched for pregnancies using diagnosis and procedure codes within the health plan data and then assigned a pregnancy outcome type and an end date of pregnancy.\nFor live-born deliveries for which the last menstrual period (LMP)-based gestational age was available in the birth certificate file, we used the first day of the LMP as the beginning of the first trimester. Trimesters were classified as the first (days 0-89), second (days 90-179), and third (days 180 through the end of pregnancy). If the LMP was missing or had an invalid value, the start date of pregnancy was defined as the delivery date minus the gestational age based on clinical or obstetrical estimates. 18 When gestational age information was missing from the birth certificates or if there was not a linked birth certificate, we applied a previously validated claims-based algorithm that used the delivery date and specific diagnosis and procedure codes recorded in the health plan claims data to estimate the trimesters. 19,20 The algorithm assumed a start date of pregnancy as delivery date minus 270 days if there was no International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for preterm birth; as delivery date minus 245 days if there was a code for preterm birth of unspecific gestational age; and as delivery date minus the upper limit of the gestational age range if there was a code for preterm birth with a specified range, for example, delivery date minus 238 days for deliveries with an ICD-9-CM code 765.27 (''33-34 weeks of gestation'').\nFor all pregnancy episodes other than live births (stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, and ectopic pregnancies), we calculated gestational age based on published estimates and expert consultation. 16,17 The start date of pregnancy was the end of pregnancy date minus 210 days for stillbirths, 70 days for spontaneous abortions, 70 days for induced abortions, and 56 days for ectopic pregnancies.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Identification of PAC", "text": "We identified all incident invasive cancer cases (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) in the tumor registry file.

This crude incidence is similar to some previous studies, 7,10 higher than others, 4,5,8 and lower than one Australian study that found an incidence of 137.3 per 100,000 live births. 9 The higher incidence in the Australian study was influenced by a very high proportion of melanoma, for which Australia has the highest incidence in the world. 21 The studies that had a lower incidence of cancer coinciding with pregnancy, compared with our study, may reflect the fact that they were from earlier calendar periods or populations who had children at younger ages.\nThe incidence of PAC increased during our study period. This finding is consistent with the results from other studies. 6,9,22 We also found a higher incidence with increasing maternal age. Some studies have shown that an increased incidence of PAC over time persisted, although lessened after a Proportions are calculated using the number of each cell as the numerator and the total number of each row as the denominator.\nb Proportions are calculated using the number of each cell as the numerator and the total number of the column as the denominator. controlling for age. 9,10 We did not control for age when estimating the incidence of PAC by year of pregnancy. However, there was no noticeable increase in the mean maternal age at diagnosis during our study period. In addition to postponing childbirth, other factors that may contribute to the observed temporal trend include improved diagnostic techniques in more recent years, and an increase in the frequency of interactions with healthcare personnel that provided additional opportunities to diagnose cancer. 7,9 Only 29% of the PAC events found in our study were diagnosed during pregnancy, the remaining 71% were diagnosed in the 1-year postpartum period. This is in agreement with other studies. 7,9,10,22 Physiological changes seen with pregnancy may mask the signs and symptoms of cancer delaying the diagnoses. 7 It is also plausible that potentially harmful diagnostic procedures, including mammography and surgical biopsies, may be delayed until the postpartum period. Finally, the development, promotion, and growth of breast cancer may be influenced by the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period. 23 We found that more than 50% of cancer events diagnosed during pregnancy were diagnosed in the first trimester. This finding is different than results from other studies that reported cancer diagnoses steadily increasing during pregnancy. 7,9 One potential explanation for the disparate findings is that prior studies did not include all pregnancies, so cancer events diagnosed during pregnancies that were ultimately terminated were not considered. Not only were cancer events likely underestimated in those studies, the proportion of cancer events identified during the first trimester would, by design, be less than what we observed in our study. Importantly, lending to the robustness of our analysis, the most common PAC sites seen in our study were breast, thyroid, melanoma, hematologic, and cervix/uterus, similar to the most common cancer sites seen among non-pregnant U.S. women of reproductive age. 24 We found an overall incidence of 26.8 per 100,000 pregnancies for breast cancer, similar to estimates reported by others. 7,9,10 However, our incidence of thyroid cancer was higher than other studies. 5,7,9 This may reflect the high incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States compared with most of the world. 25 We observed an incidence of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies for cervical/uterine cancer, much lower than reported by a Danish study 10 but similar to other studies. 5,7,9 Our incidence estimates of breast, cervical/uterine, and ovarian cancer were considerably higher in pregnancies that ended in non-live birth than in pregnancies that ended in live birth. This is not surprising as cervix/uterus and breast were two of the most commonly diagnosed cancer sites associated with induced abortions in the first trimester in our study.\nOur study has several strengths. First, it is a large U.S. population-based study that included geographically and demographically diverse populations. Second, study information was collected from data obtained during routine healthcare delivery and payment and thus was not susceptible to recall bias. Third, unlike the majority of the previous studies, our study included pregnancies that not only ended in live birth but also medically attended stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, and ectopic pregnancies. Fourth, our study contains validated information on tumor characteristics and reproductive factors from tumor registries and birth certificate files.\nAs with any retrospective observational study, however, our study has limitations. We likely did not fully capture certain pregnancy episodes. Specifically, our databases did not have early pregnancy losses that were not medically recognized or attended, or pregnancies that occurred outside the participating health plans (e.g., some induced abortions, certain home births). However, live births, which occurred with the majority of pregnancies, were well captured and many had also been linked to the infant birth certificate file. Also, it is unlikely that we missed substantial numbers of pregnancy episodes given the similarity of our frequencies of pregnancy outcomes to those of national statistics. In the United States, 65% of all pregnancies ended in live birth, 18% in induced abortions, and 17% in fetal loss in 2008. 26 In our study, among women aged 10-54 years during 2001-2013, 66% of pregnancies ended in live birth, 16% in induced abortions, and 18% in fetal loss. Our study population was older and mostly privately insured, which may account for the small differences.\nWe did not have gestational age information on pregnancies that ended in non-live birth and live-born deliveries without linked infant birth certificate files. However, the gestational age algorithms that we used in these pregnancies were adapted from previously validated algorithms. 16,17,19,20 We did not have reasonably complete postpartum data for pregnancies identified in 2013. We also did not require women to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for the entire 1-year postpartum period to avoid potential selection bias that might arise from restricting the analysis to women who had insurance coverage and survived during the entire postpartum year. This might have led to an under-ascertainment of cancer events during the postpartum period. However, only approximately 8% of women in our study left the health plan during the year after delivery, any under-ascertainment of cancer event was likely not substantial.\nWe did not examine factors (e.g., maternal comorbidity, breastfeeding) that might be predictive of PAC risk. This is a topic of future research. Finally, our population included only women with private health insurance, who are more likely to be employed, have higher incomes, and have more interactions with healthcare providers compared with those on Medicaid or uninsured. 27 Higher socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with a higher incidence of PAC, possibly due in part to more interactions with healthcare providers and opportunities for diagnosis. 9 Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to all women of childbearing age.", "n_publication_ref": 38, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study provides contemporary incidence estimates of PAC from a large population-based cohort of U.S. women.

this study was to evaluate the maternal outcome in women with very advanced maternal age (VAMA) at childbirth (>45 years) compared to advanced maternal age (35-39 and 40-44 years). Methods: Retrospective cohort study using the Texas Public Use Data File, years 2013-2014. Maternal age was a three-level variable: 35-39 (referent), 40-44, and 45-59 years (VAMA). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for the two older age groups for various obstetrical and nonobstetrical complications were calculated from logbinomial regression models. Results: The sample consisted of 96,879 deliveries. In univariate analyses, a higher frequency ( p < 0.05) of gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, pregnancy related hypertensive disorders, multiple gestation, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, placenta previa, postpartum hemorrhage, small for gestational age, intrauterine fetal death, and length of stay were noted in the two older maternal age groups compared to the youngest maternal age group. Multiple gestations were noted to be more frequent in the two older groups: the VAMA group had a 336% increase in their risk (aRR = 4.36, 95% CI: 3.68-5.17), while women 40-44 years of age experienced a 17% increase in their risk (aRR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07-1.29) compared to women in the 35-39 year group. The risk of the following outcomes was approximately doubled in VAMA women compared to the referent (all statistically significant): small for gestational age (aRR = 1.92), stillbirth (aRR = 2.12), and intrauterine fetal death (aRR = 1.96). Conclusions: This population-based study detected a dose-response association between maternal age and the risk of multiple maternal and fetal complications.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T he proportion of births to women of advanced maternal age (AMA, age \u202135 years) and very advanced maternal age (VAMA, age \u202145 years) has increased over time throughout the developed world [1][2][3] and in developing countries. 4 For example, the first birth rate for women 35 to 39 years of age in the United States increased from 1970 to 2012 (from 1.7 to 11.0/1,000), and for women aged 40 to 44 years it increased from 1985 to 2012 (from 0.5 to 2.3/1,000). 2 Live births among AMA women aged 35 years and older have increased sharply from 1970 to 2000, from 5% to *13% in United States. 5 The increase in maternal age is related to various social factors (e.g., longer schooling, higher professional goals, and later marriage), improved awareness and availability of effective contraception, and improvement in assisted reproductive technology (ART).\nAMA and VAMA have been linked to an increased frequency of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes such as cesarean delivery (CD), preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm deliveries, and stillbirth. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] A systematic review indicated that advanced aged mothers have an increased risk of stillbirth, 12 but reports are conflicting and the risk may differ based on demographic factors like multiparity and prenatal care. Other authors have reported no significant difference in the perinatal outcomes of older women, 13 obstetrical outcome, 14 birth weight, Apgar score, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit compared to younger age women. 15 Two studies from Turkey reported no association between extremely advanced age (>40 years) and complications, including GDM, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, CD, stillbirth, preterm delivery and macrosomia, and newborn respiratory difficulties. 16,17 The higher risk of poor maternal and birth outcomes in older mothers coupled with an increasing frequency of childbearing among older women poses challenges for healthcare providers. 8 Due to reduced fertility, these women often need in vitro fertilization with oocyte donation. The risk of preeclampsia, prematurity, and twin pregnancies is higher in pregnancies achieved with oocyte donation compared to spontaneous pregnancies in AMA patients. 18 Previous investigations of the effect of maternal age on various adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes have used mothers 20 to 29 years of age as the referent group. 7,8,19 The aim of our study was to determine whether VAMA (>45 years) imposes increased maternal and fetal risks compared to AMA (35-44 years). We analyzed the Texas hospital inpatient discharge Public Use Data File (PUDF) and compared the incidence and relative magnitude of selected adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes by maternal age group.

These diagnosis and procedure variables were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The PUDF does not contain a continuous age variable; however, it does have a categorical age variable, which is composed of multiple age groups of varying widths (for example, 3 or 5 years). Records were included in our sample if the woman both delivered during that stay and was between 35 and 59 years of age (based on the patient's age group). The terminal age category included in our sample was the 55 to 59 years group. Women who delivered during their hospital stay were identified by searching each of the 25 discharge diagnosis fields for an ICD-9-CM code beginning with V27.\nIn an effort to include only one record for patients who were transferred from one reporting facility to another reporting facility, records with a missing value for the patient status variable were excluded as were the records of patients whose patient status variable indicated that they were transferred to another hospital (Fig. 1). In addition, patients who had not been discharged (as per their patient status variable) yet but were included in the PUDF were excluded from our analysis.

Various outcomes such as length of stay and pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia) were studied (Table 1). The main exposure (independent) variable was maternal age: women 40 to 44 years of age and 45 to 59 years of age were compared to women 35 to 39 years of age. For categorical outcomes, initial analyses involved the creation of contingency tables and the use of the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, using a significance level of 0.05. For length of stay, a one-way analysis of variance was performed.\nFor binary categorical outcomes such as hospital mortality and preeclampsia, adjusted risk ratios (RRs) were calculated from log-binomial regression models. These RRs compared women 45 to 59 years of age and those who were 40 to 44 years of age to women 35 to 39 years of age and were adjusted for race and Hispanic ethnicity, obesity, maternal smoking, and primigravidity. Maternal race and ethnicity was a three-level categorical variable and modeled using two dummy variables: White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and other. Women who were obese, smokers (former or current), and primigravidas were identified using the ICD-9-CM codes noted in Table 1.\nThe log-binomial regression models were created using the GENMOD Procedure. This procedure fits generalized linear models. We specified a log link and a binomial distribution. 20 Several of the log-binomial regression models failed to converge and in these situations RRs were estimated from Poisson regression models with robust variance. 21 We chose to use log-binomial and Poisson regression models because they yield RRs. While logistic regression is a more popular technique for analyzing dichotomous outcomes, it generates odds ratios rather than RRs. If the outcome is not rare, then the odds ratio and RR will deviate from one another. 20 ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Of the 96,879 records reviewed from the PUDF, 78,745 women were in the age group 35-39 years, 17,129 were in the age group 40-44 years, and 1,005 were 45-59 years old at the time of delivery (Table 2).\nDemographic characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 2. Primigravidity was more prevalent in the age group 45-59 years compared to the other two age groups. A higher proportion of Hispanics was noted in the two younger age groups compared to the oldest age group.

Similar to other reports, due to the use of ART, older women were more likely to have higher order multiple pregnancies. 30 In addition, the incidence of placenta previa was higher in older women. 9,31 In the current study, VAMA patients had a higher risk of SGA, stillbirth, neonatal death, and IUFD. In agreement with our results, Salem et al. reported a significant positive correlation between AMA and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight, congenital malformations, and perinatal mortality. 32 A systematic review by Flenady et al. reported that the rate of stillbirth is stable in high-income countries; some of the contributing factors are: obesity, preexisting diabetes, hypertension, maternal age, and smoking. 33 Other factors that have been attributed to higher risk of stillbirth are placental abruption, SGA, and primiparity. 33 Salihu et al. compared four different groups of women (25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and >or = 40) with women 20-24 years old and found that older maternal age is associated with a higher risk of stillbirth in a dose-dependent pattern. 8 These findings are similar to what we found in our study. In contrast, an investigation by Khalil et al. did not note any difference in the stillbirth rate in older versus younger women. 34 Epidemiological studies based on administrative statewide databases, such as ours, have limitations. First, these studies depend on the accuracy of the diagnostic codes entered in patient discharge reports. Yasmeen et al. have addressed this issue in their report. 35 They analyzed the accuracy of multiple ICD-9-CM codes for obstetric diagnoses and procedures in California hospital discharge data. 35 They reported that accuracy varied from moderate to high depending upon the code. 35 According to their study, weighted sensitivity of CD was 100% and 89% for instrumental deliveries. Sensitivity exceeded 60% for comorbidities like chorioamnionitis, diabetes, premature labor, preeclampsia, and IUFD, while sensitivity was poor for anemia, asthma, thyroid disorders, mental disorders, genitourinary infection, and drug abuse. 35 In addition, it is possible that some of the women in our cohort delivered more than once during the 2-year study period. The PUDF does not contain a unique patient identi-fier. The availability of such an identifier would have allowed us to restrict our sample to women who only delivered once during the period of interest or use appropriate statistical methods to account for the violation of statistical independence. The other limitation is, since state licensed rural hospitals are exempt from reporting their data to PUDF, this might bias the findings due to possible differences in baseline demographics and healthcare available to women residing there. Our results may not be generalizable to other regions of the United States that have a different ethnic composition.\nOne of the noticeable strengths of our study was the large sample size relative to various published retrospective or prospective studies. Large investigations have greater statistical power to detect age differences in the risk of rare events such as maternal death and venothromboembolism. Furthermore, we used a statewide database. In the fourth quarter of 2014, 648 hospitals across Texas were required to report their inpatient discharge data to the Texas Health Care Information Collection (personal communication, Texas Health Care Information Collection).", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our study demonstrated an increased risk of pregnancy and perinatal complications such as SGA, GDM, pregestational diabetes, preeclampsia, eclampsia, CD, stillbirth, IUFD, and neonatal death in VAMA women.

Untreated, DED can become chronic, progressive, and significantly affect an individual's quality of life. Women are disproportionately affected by DED, are diagnosed at a younger age, and experience more severe symptoms compared with men. DED is associated with a wide range of comorbid conditions; there is a strong association between DED and autoimmune disorders, especially those that affect women at many times the rate of men. Treatment response questionnaires indicate women respond better to a wellness model of treatment for DED than men. Furthermore, women's health care-seeking behaviors provide opportunities for general practitioners, specialists, and women's health centers to help identify women with DED or at risk for DED for referral to an eye care specialist. This review of the prevalence of DED in women, and gender and sex-specific aspects of DED, highlight a significant opportunity for action. Earlier diagnosis and treatment of this common but burdensome condition could significantly improve a woman's quality of life.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "D ry eye disease (DED) is an ocular disorder that is often characterized by symptoms of eye dryness, discomfort, and sensitivity to light. 1,2 It is highly prevalent, increases with age and, as is the case with many ocular conditions, disproportionately affects women. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Untreated, DED may become chronic and progressive and can significantly affect one's quality of life. 7,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Greater utilization of the health care system by women provides the opportunity for DED to be recognized and diagnosed earlier. 12,19 Furthermore, women's health care settings, which are designed to offer ''one-stop shopping'' for medical needs compared with general internal medicine practices, and primarily utilized by younger individuals, 20 may provide additional opportunities to identify, study, educate, and treat women with DED or at risk of developing DED. However, the literature on DED currently lacks a comprehensive review of the interrelationship of DED with women's health. Such a review could be used by clinicians outside of eye care, in addition to ophthalmologists and optometrists, to identify women with DED, or at higher risk of developing DED.\nDED is a multifactorial disease, with a highly variable presentation in both clinical signs and patient-reported symptoms, making it difficult for clinicians outside of eye care to recognize. [21][22][23] There are many symptoms other than ''dryness'' that are associated with dry eye that clinicians might not know, for example, blurred vision. However, a growing body of research investigating the root pathology of DED, namely dysregulation of the ocular surface, including the ocular surface immune response, has led to greater understanding of the risk factors associated with DED. 10,[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] With these advances, it may be easier for non-eye care professionals to identify possible DED from risk factors, such as chronic illnesses and autoimmune diseases, combined with symptoms of ocular discomfort or visual disturbance.\nWe performed a nonsystematic literature search on topics focusing on the pathophysiology of DED and key epidemiology studies that have assessed differences in DED prevalence. Published studies discussed in this review include data according to self-reported gender (woman or man; e.g., surveys) or biological sex (female or male; e.g., hormonal studies). We explore the biological sex and hormonal differences in ocular structure, functioning, and health that contribute to the higher DED prevalence in women. We recapitulate the presenting signs and symptoms of DED that differ between women and men, and summarize some of the current research on DED-associated comorbidities that are more prevalent in, or specific to, women.\nThere is a high prevalence of DED in several Asian populations. 6 However, when the data are stratified by gender, distribution of the disease is similar to studies in primarily Caucasian populations irrespective of ethnicity. 32 In this review, we do not discuss the relationship between ethnicity and DED.\nIt is our hope that this review reaches a broad audience of health care professionals, with the goal of contributing to well-informed decisions for patient care strategies that do not increase the risk of DED or exacerbate current symptoms of DED in their patients. A better understanding of the risk factors and recognition of signs and symptoms of DED may facilitate and expedite referrals to an eye care professional. Furthermore, we envision a wide-ranging partnership between health care providers across the health care spectrum and eye care professionals that diagnose and/or treat patients with DED that can foster a more interdisciplinary approach to recommending preventative measures and treatments.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Definition and Pathophysiology of DED", "text": "Tears help to maintain the health of the ocular surface in addition to providing a smooth, refractive surface for optimal vision. 33,34 Tears form a multilayered gradient fluid film over the ocular surface that helps to protect the cornea and lubricate blinking mechanics. The most superficial layer is a lipid layer that is deposited by small glands, called meibomian glands (MGs), lining the upper and lower eyelids during the blinking process and seals the tear film to reduce tear evaporation. The middle aqueous layer, composed of water, soluble mucins, and other proteins, constitutes 90% of the tear film volume and enables tear spreading 34,35 ; this layer is secreted by the lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands. The innermost mucous layer, made up of membrane-adherent mucins, interacts directly with the corneal epithelial cells. 34,35 In healthy eyes, homeostasis of the tear film layers and their components is maintained within a very narrow, yet stable range. 34 The homeostasis of the tear film, or loss thereof, can be assessed by measuring its osmolarity, which is more generically defined as the extent of solute particles in a solution. 36 Tear film hyperosmolarity is, therefore, an increased amount of solute particles per tear film volume, and can result from reduced tear volume or increased tear evaporation. 33,34 A central factor in the pathogenesis of DED is the loss of tear film stability, which usually results in hyperosmolarity, and leads to or may exacerbate damage to the ocular surface. 1,2,33,34 Hyperosmolarity can result in symptoms of ocular discomfort, dryness, and/or vision disturbances. However, DED can also be present, as assessed by multiple clinical signs, in asymptomatic individuals. The chronic and sometimes progressive nature of DED is believed to be initiated by multiple factors that are self-perpetuated by an inflammatory cascade that causes further damage to the ocular surface. 33 This, in turn, increases the inflammatory response and perpetuates a cycle of increased osmolarity and ocular surface damage. This ''vicious circle'' of DED can be complicated by a variety of lid and ocular surface diseases that further aggravate and damage the ocular surface. 13 Hyperosmolarity of the tear film can result from reduced tear volume or increased tear evaporation. 33,34 Aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE) is defined by the presence of normal evaporation with a reduced tear volume and is the primary cause of DED in individuals with lacrimal gland dysfunction, such as in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes mellitus, and age-related dry eye. Evaporative dry eye (EDE) is characterized by a normal tear volume with an increased rate of tear evaporation. EDE is the primary cause of DED in MG dysfunction and atrophy, and also is associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. 1 While there are two main types of DED defined, people with DED tend to fall within a spectrum of aqueous deficiency and evaporative disease, and often have signs of both present. 1 ", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Epidemiology of DED", "text": "The epidemiology of DED has been increasingly studied since the publication of the 2007 Dry Eye Disease Workshop (DEWS) report, 2 an encyclopedic review of the current state of DED knowledge and research. It was used to identify future research efforts needed to improve the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of DED to facilitate development of potential therapies. However, a central difficulty in these efforts has been establishing the criteria for diagnosis of DED.\nCriteria for diagnosing DED vary considerably across epidemiological studies because of high variability in the clinical presentation and numerous causes and/or complicating factors of DED. A diagnosis of DED is based on self-reported signs and symptoms in response to standardized questionnaires on ocular discomfort (physical sensation, intensity, and frequency) and clinical tests (e.g., corneal staining and measures of tear break-up time). For comparisons across epidemiological studies using similar or the same criteria for diagnosis of DED, and where the prevalence and incidence of DED in population-based studies has been stratified by gender and age, it has been consistently found that DED increases with age and disproportionately affects women. [3][4][5][6][7][9][10][11]37,38 A meta-analysis of recent DED prevalence studies conducted by the 2017 TFOS DEWS II researchers found increases in the prevalence of DED signs and symptoms per decade starting at ages 40-49 years. 11 For women, the prevalence of DED symptoms starts increasing from 14% at 50 years of age to 22% for those 80+ years of age. This trend is both less prominent and starts later for men, with a prevalence of DED symptoms increasing from 7% in men 60-69 years of age to 13% for those 80+ years of age.\nTwo large studies of DED prevalence conducted in the United States using the same criteria for DED diagnosis, the 2003 Women's Health Study (WHS; n = 39,000 females, ages 49+ years) and the 2009 Physicians' Health Study (PHS; n = 25,000 males, ages 50+ years), were used to draw comparisons of DED between genders and across ages. 6,12,39 The studies found that the mean age of patients at diagnosis of their DED was 60 years for women versus 66 years for men. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) 40 and the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) 41 are two of several validated dry eye questionnaires; evaluation using these questionnaires showed that severe symptoms were more common in women. 6 Prevalence values from these studies were used to estimate DED prevalence in the United States population at nearly twice as high for women (3.25 million) as men (1.68 million). 6,12,39 Table 1 summarizes recent DED studies from the United States that stratify DED prevalence and associated signs and symptoms by sex and/or gender. All of the studies generally support that major DED risk factors include female sex and age. The Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS, 2014) found that prevalence in women was 17.9% versus 10.5% in men and that hormone therapy (HT) in women was an additional risk factor for DED. 7 An analysis of data from the United States National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS, 2017) found that gender differences in the prevalence of DED increased with age. 32 While the prevalence of DED was nominally higher for women versus men in younger years (age 18-34 years: 2.9% vs. 2.6%), this difference increased significantly for older respondents (age \u202175 years: 22.8% vs. 12.6%).\nBradley et al. reported on a study of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System (MHS) claims database analysis (2017), which covers over 9.7 million active military duty and retiree beneficiaries and their dependents from ages 2-80+ years. 42 MHS data analysis revealed higher prevalence of DED in women (7.8% vs. 3.0% in men), and increases with age (18-39 years: 3.1% vs. 1.3%; \u202150 years: 15.9% vs. 7.0%). 42 These differences in DED prevalence between women and men fall in the domain of gender effects on health. In addition to differences in metabolism, lifestyle, and physical performance, this rich field of study has identified sex differences in response to therapeutic agents, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, sex differences in autoimmune conditions, and a spectrum of sex differences across common diseases such as coronary heart disease. 43 DED prevalence differences are attributed to biological sex, hormonal, and gender differences, which contribute to DED risk factors, presentation, immune response, pain experience, and treatment response that are specific to women. Fortunately, there are differences in women's health care-seeking behaviors and health care service utilization, which will be discussed later, that provide opportunities for earlier referral and diagnosis of DED. 19 Biological sex differences that affect ocular structure, functioning, and health are noted from the molecular level to the physiological observational level. Molecular-level differences include differences in tissue morphology, gene expression, protein synthesis, and epithelial cell dynamics. 10 These molecular-level differences translate to differences in aqueous tear output, lipid production, mucous secretion, tear film stability, blink rate, and ocular immune functioning, which, when pathologic, may contribute to DED signs and symptoms.\nFor example, the transglutaminase 1 (TGase1) gene, which catalyzes protein crosslinking and thus plays a role in keratinization mechanisms, has greater expression in the healthy female cornea than the healthy male cornea by about 2:1. 44 An in vivo vitamin A deficiency model of dry eye showed that TGase1 transcript and protein levels increased with time and disease severity. 45 Pathologic keratinization of the cornea and conjunctival epithelium in patients with severe chronic dry eye, such as that associated with Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is accompanied by upregulation of TGase1. [46][47][48] It has been hypothesized that the increased expression of TGase1 in women, when combined with differentiated levels of other important ocular sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), could be a contributing factor in the increased prevalence of DED in women. 44 Hormonal differences between men and women, including both basal and lifespan-associated levels of sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), as well as hormonal cycles specific to the female sex (menstruation, pregnancy, menopause), also affect ocular structure, functioning, and health. Studies of associations of DED and sex steroid levels (testosterone, 4androstene-3, 17-dione, estrogen, estrone, 17-b-estradiol, progesterone, and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone) have produced a variety of results regarding the levels of many sex steroids, especially estrogen, and their association with DED. 10,[49][50][51][52][53]  Among these, low androgen levels are most consistently associated with DED. 51 Sex steroids can be assessed systemically, by sampling of blood serum levels, or locally, by quantification of their presence in tears or ocular tissues. 53 The associations of sex steroids to ocular diseases and DED have yet to be fully determined, but consensus holds that their influence on ocular surface conditions should be considered.\nThe association between DED and both systemic and ocular testosterone levels in women has yielded conflicting and/or inconclusive results. Blood serum levels of testosterone in postmenopausal women were assessed against corresponding OSDI scores in a small study between those with mild-tomoderate DED (n = 15), those with severe dry eye (n = 4), and women with no dry eye (n = 5), 49 revealing no significant relationship between the two. In a study of 44 postmenopausal women, half with severe EDE (n = 22) and half without (n = 22), profiles of fasting blood serum levels of 17-bestradiol, estrone, and total testosterone were compared with results from detailed eye examinations. The levels of 17-bestradiol, estrone, and total testosterone in women with severe EDE showed inverse correlations to tear film osmolarity (regression coefficient, r = -0.7, -0.88, and -0.81, respectively). 50 A method of steroid profiling in tear fluid was first published by Pieragostino et al. (simultaneous quantification of cortisol, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 4-androstene-3,17dione, testosterone, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, and progesterone levels). 53 These steroids were extracted from tears collected on a Schirmer strip, followed by subsequent analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. This method was used in an analysis of tear samples from 14 females with DED and 13 healthy female controls, which found significant decreases in cortisol, 4androstene-3,17-dione, and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone levels for patients with dry eye compared with controls. 53 In a separate study, venous blood sampling and meibography were used to evaluate the association between serum levels of testosterone and estradiol and MG morphology in postmenopausal women (n = 198, average age 61.2 [-9.1] years). 52 MG dropout increased with higher testosterone levels, and a significant difference in testosterone levels was observed in the mild versus severe MG dropout groups (MG dropout scores of 1 and 4, respectively; p = 0.002). Differences were not significant with estradiol and meibography assessments ( p = 0.53).\nSex-associated differences in ocular physiology have been identified in the MG, 54 lacrimal gland, 55 conjunctiva, 56 and cornea, 8 as well as other eye structures (anterior chamber, ciliary body, iris, lens, retina, and vitreous). These physiological differences may contribute to the different DED prevalence rates observed in women and men. 10 For example, sex-specific changes in the cornea occur during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause, and include variations in thickness, hydration, curvature, sensitivity, and endothelial pigmentation, as well as contact lens tolerance and a higher prevalence of a loss of visual acuity. 8 Some studies have suggested that changes in estrogen levels alter ocular surface equilibrium during the menstrual cycle, impacting subjective dry eye symptoms in female patients. 57 In women with dry eye in particular, the estrogen peak (during the follicular phase) appears to be related to symptoms of impaired tear production and stability, surface dryness, and inflammation. 58 Sex-related differences in the innate and adaptive immune responses of the ocular surface have been found to be minimal in the absence of systemic diseases. 59 However, the close association of DED and autoimmune diseases that disproportionately affect women may also suggest that ocular surface immunity differences between the sexes manifest when the immune system is challenged. 10 ", "n_publication_ref": 57, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DED-Associated Comorbidities Burden and Autoimmune Diseases Primarily Affecting Women", "text": "DED is comorbid with a wide range of conditions. In the NHWS analysis, the extent of this association with various comorbidities differed between symptomatic and asymptomatic DED as well as with sex (Fig. 1, Shire data on file). All respondent women in the study with thyroid disease or depression were at greater risk of symptomatic DED compared with men. The analysis was further stratified by age groups. For survey respondents <65 years, diabetes mellitus was an additional risk factor for symptomatic DED in women but not men, and for those \u202165 years of age, headache/migraine or depression in the preceding 12 months were additional risk factors in women but not men. While headache, as a symptom, can be a very broad term-that is, not every patient with a headache is at risk for DED-older women who describe frequent or regular headaches/migraine that also have coexisting ocular symptoms may require a referral for possible DED.\nIn both age groups, men diagnosed with DED were at a higher risk of having glaucoma than women with any type of DED. Anxiety was a much higher risk for symptomatic DED in women \u202165 years of age than for men. In the analysis of the WHS versus PHS studies, 6 there was a significantly higher comorbid rate of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rosacea in women. For men, higher comorbid rates of blepharitis and MG dysfunction were observed.\nAutoimmune diseases are generally more prevalent in women than in men. 60 Severe dry eye can be precipitated by several common autoimmune conditions in which inflammation plays a key role: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, SLE, RA, and thyroid diseases. 60 Although the link between rosacea and autoimmunity is still under debate, rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease that is often associated with DED. 25,61,62 In these diseases, females represent the majority of cases (ratio of women:men) 63 ; Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (9:1), SLE (7:1), RA (3:1), thyroid diseases (3.1-5:1), and rosacea (3:1) (Table 2).\nIn Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, a chronic inflammatory disorder, lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal glands precipitates ADDE. 21,64 In the lacrimal gland tissue of women with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, androgen deficiency is both a sign and potentially a cause of the local steroidal imbalance precipitating lacrimal gland inflammation and ADDE. 65 Further research is needed to understand the specific lacrimal and ocular surface mechanisms of EDE in relation to Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\nSLE is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disease, and DED is its most common ocular manifestation. 25 Ocular symptoms can correlate with systemic disease progression, which may present before other systemic signs of SLE, underscoring the importance of ophthalmological examinations for SLE patients. 66 Immune complex deposition in the lacrimal gland caused by SLE may result in secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome causing dry eye due to lack of adequate tear production (ADDE). Approximately 20% of SLE patients experience coexisting Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. 67 RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory polyarthritis that causes irreversible synovial joint damage. 25 ADDE is the most common ophthalmic manifestation of RA. 68 DED prevalence in RA patients is reported to be 15%-25%. 69 DED in RA patients can be caused by the inflammatory effects of the disease, but DED may also manifest iatrogenically through treatment of the arthritis with corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. 29 New categories of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs that block the Janus kinase pathways in the immune response are available; however, their effect on ocular immune response, and their risk for development of DED, is not yet known. 70,71 It is common for patients with rosacea to have ocular signs and symptoms. These can include blurred vision, photopho-bia, tearing, burning, irritation, foreign body sensation, and red eyes. 25 Inflammation of the tissue around the MGs and subsequent alteration to the lipids produced by the glands is hypothesized to be a cause of the ocular manifestations in these patients and can lead to tear film abnormalities and EDE. Ocular rosacea also causes a reduction in tear volume in more than one-third of those with the ocular manifestation. 72 A study was undertaken to compare the symptomatic relief from ocular complications of rosacea that could be obtained from treatment with topical cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% versus oral doxycycline, the reference treatment for ocular rosacea. The topical ophthalmic treatment was found to be more effective than the systemic medication more commonly prescribed for rosacea patients. 73,74 Autoimmune thyroid eye disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, is a disorder in which the ocular tissues are attacked and become inflamed. 75 Women are five to six times more likely than men to get thyroid eye disease. 76 It is believed that thyroid antibodies target eye muscles and connective tissue within the eye socket because these tissues contain proteins that appear similar to those of the thyroid gland. Dry eye and irritation in these patients are attributable to inflammation and swelling of tissue around the eye that causes incomplete blinking and an inability to shut the eyes. Thyroid eye disease must be treated as a separate ocular condition to the thyroid imbalance since systemic treatment of the thyroid gland does not consistently improve thyroid eye disease. 76 ", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "DED and Chronic Pain", "text": "Associations have also been found between DED and chronic pain. 18,23,[77][78][79][80] Like DED, risk factors for many chronic pain syndromes (CPS) are female sex and older age. 81,82 The higher incidence of pain-related symptoms among women with DED compared with men with DED suggests an underlying biological mechanism that may be sex related. 10 In the Netherlands, a study of 425 patients with DED found that 17% of DED patients had at least one other CPS, such as chronic pelvic pain, fibromyalgia, or irritable bowel syndrome. 82 When assessed by the OSDI symptom survey, DED patients with CPS had a mean OSDI score of 45.8, versus 33.8 in DED patients with no CPS. OSDI score is on a scale of 0-100; normal range is 0-10, clinical sensitivity for DED begins at an OSDI score of \u202113, moderate DED 23-32, and severe DED \u202133. 40,83 Of 64 patients from the United Kingdom Twins Registry who were diagnosed with DED, 38% (24/64) also had CPS and higher OSDI symptom scores compared with those with no CPS (OSDI score 34.1 vs. 14.4; p = 0.001). 84 From a prospective, cross-sectional study of 40 DED patients with no other known systemic disease, age and gender matched to 20 patients with fibromyalgia and 20 healthy controls, 85 it was found that 62% of patients with fibromyalgia had DED based on OSDI scores. Ocular and visual symptoms self-reported from the OSDI and the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ-25) were statistically higher in DED and fibromyalgia groups when compared with the control group ( p < 0.0001).\nVehof and researchers from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have hypothesized that the chronic pain in DED may be a neuropathic type of pain, persisting through nociceptive pathways. 82 Clinical consequences of corneal damage activate an alarm system integrated in the peripheral and central trigeminal sensory network. Pathological elements in this response lead to a neuralgia that is characterized by a large disparity between intense pain symptoms and clinical signs correlating to those symptoms. 79 They also found the severity of signs of DED had a lower correlation to symptoms in women compared with men (r = 0.11 in women vs. r = 0.33 in men; p = 0.01). 86 The lack of concordance between symptoms and signs of DED has contributed to the lack of standardized diagnosis used across clinical studies. 77,87,88 ", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Iatrogenic and Gender Differences That Increase DED Risk in Women", "text": "We must also consider iatrogenic causes of DED and cultural behaviors specific to women that may increase the risks of DED. Iatrogenic causes include contact lens use; elective ophthalmic procedures, such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for refractive error correction; periorbital surgeries to improve blinking mechanics or for cosmesis; and both systemic and topical medical treatments, such as hormone replacement therapies and allergy eye drops. 59 Behavioral causes of DED include cosmetic periorbital surgeries and the use of permanent and topical cosmetics and facial creams. 59 Some of the external causes of DED are listed in Table 3.\nTwo-thirds of the more than 45 million contact lens users in the United States are women. 89,90 In some individuals, depending on the type of contact lens, long-term contact lens wear has been found to desensitize the cornea. 91 In a large epidemiological study in Canada, contact lens use was found to increase the risk of experiencing DED symptoms. 92 In a questionnaire-based study of contact lens wearers in the United States, ocular surface discomfort (scratchiness) was significantly higher for women than for men (p < 0.008). 93 In addition, dryness and discomfort are the leading causes of contact lens discontinuation. 94,95 In a recent study, contact lens use was found to accelerate age-related morphological changes in MGs, such as MG dropout, which may be associated with DED. 96 LASIK is a procedure performed for the surgical correction of refractive error. In the United States, LASIK has been performed in over 21 million patients as of 2015. 97 LASIK may increase the risk for DED, particularly in women. 97,98 Data from the UK Biobank Study found that LASIK procedures were performed more often in women than in men, although the incidence of this procedure and the gender difference decreased with age. 97 A 1-year retrospective analysis of 88 patients who underwent LASIK for treatment of hyperopia concluded that DED was particularly problematic in females and was associated with refractive regression. 98 Blepharoplasty after a LASIK procedure creates an increased risk for development of severe DED. 59 This is because the LASIK procedure can reduce corneal sensitivity, resulting in a decreased blink rate and subsequent reduction in tear production. Postprocedure, blepharoplasty causes transient (or infrequently, permanent) lagophthalmos, which is compensated for by an increase in blink rate. However, if the tear volume is insufficient because of a prior LASIK procedure, the increased blink rate can cause mechanical irritation. 99 In the United States in 2015, women accounted for 85% of those presenting for more than 200,000 cosmetic blepharoplasty procedures. 100 From a 2013 10-year retrospective medical record review of patients undergoing cosmetic blepharoplasty (892 patients, 16-83 years of age with a mean age of 53 years), 86.1% were female and 63% underwent concurrent upper and lower blepharoplasty. Compared with an upper or lower blepharoplasty alone, the concurrent procedure was more highly associated with the percentage of patients that subsequently developed DED (31.3% concurrent vs. 12.9% upper and 22.9% lower, chi square test = 18.1, p < 0.001). 101 Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injections 102 are used in ophthalmology to improve a number of conditions, including DED. BTX-A injections into the periorbital area, such as the orbicularis muscle, have been used successfully to treat dry eye by reducing lacrimal drainage. 103 However, repeated BTX-A injections into lateral canthal rhytids for cosmetic effect, more commonly known as correction of crow's feet, may cause temporary dry eye due to muscle weakness that results in incomplete blinking. 104 As the effect of these injections is transient, the experience of dry eye symptoms may also be transient. However, if DED is already present, or the patient has comorbidities that incur a risk for DED, the transient cause may lead to a chronic condition. [102][103][104] Dermapigmentation of the eyelids, or cosmetic eye tattooing, can cause a destruction of the MGs due to excessive needle penetration and ink pigment migration. 105 Loss of MGs in these cases reduces the lipid layer of the tear film and can lead to EDE. Topical ocular cosmetics, especially mascara and eyeliner, as well as oil-based facial creams applied near the eye, can cause changes to the tear film and its stability. Retinoids in moisturizing creams have been associated with problems in MGs. 10 In a study that compared ocular comfort and OSDI scores between cosmetic users (N = 1,360 females, median age 25 years; 83% reported wearing cosmetics >3 times per week [mascara most common]) and nonusers, OSDI scores were found to be similar (p = 0.083) 106 When cosmetics were not used by habitual users, the perception of ocular comfort increased (p < 0.001).\nPrescribed medications can also contribute to the development of dry eye. 59 These can arise from side effects, which cause systemic changes that decrease secretory fluids and result in dryness of mucous membranes (e.g., dry mouth, dry eyes), or induce local changes in eye function (e.g., reduction in production of tear film components, induction of inflammation, and/or swelling of ocular tissues). 59 Active ingredients or inactive ingredients (i.e., preservatives) of topical ophthalmic medications may cause or aggravate eye dryness, irritating ocular tissues or destabilizing the tear film.\nWhile preservative-free preparations of ophthalmic products are commonly available, many ophthalmic preparations contain preservatives to prevent microbial proliferation, deciphering the contribution of the active versus inactive ingredient as it relates to DED can be difficult.

In the WHS analysis, postmenopausal HT increased DED risk by *70% for estrogen users and *30% for estrogen+progesterone/progestin users. 12 A cross-sectional study of 360 postmenopausal women investigating the effect of HT on DED showed significant differences in increased DED severity between the following groups: HT versus no HT ( p < 0.0001); HT dosage level >1 mg/day versus <1 mg/day ( p < 0.0001); and HT duration of at least 12, 36, or 48 months ( p < 0.0001). 111 Oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use in premenopausal women (n = 52 OCP, n = 45 non-OCP, mean age, 26.0 -3.7 years), resulted in higher SANDE scores ( p < 0.01) and the combination of OCP and recent contact lens wear were associated with higher SANDE ( p < 0.001) and OSDI scores ( p = 0.015). 112 Serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), used to treat depression, have known anticholinergic adverse effects, including decreased lacrimal secretion, that increase the risk of dry eye. 110 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), an alternative class of medication for treatment of depression, do not adversely affect the cholinergic system.\nHowever, in an investigation of tear film volume (classified as >5 or \u00a35 mm by the Schirmer test) with antidepressant use ( \u20214 weeks), duloxetine (SNRI), venlafaxine (SNRI), and escitalopram (SSRI) significantly reduced tear film volume ( p < 0.001) compared with control patients not on antidepressants. This finding suggests that SSRIs may impact tear film volume through a mechanism outside the cholinergic system. Patients using SSRIs had lower wetting measurements compared with those on SNRIs (p < 0.05). However, both SNRIs and SSRIs may contribute to dry eye. 110 In the SSRI group, 10 patients (19.8% of 54 eyes) had dry eye, and in the SNRI group 19 patients (35% of 54 eyes) had dry eye. The tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and thioridazine for schizophrenia also have anticholinergic effects that increase the risk for DED. 113 Gender Differences in Health-Related Quality of Life Indicators associated with overall physical and mental health include adequate sleep; stable moods; balanced nutrition; and minimal stress, anxiety, and depression. 32,[114][115][116][117] For many of these indicators, women fare poorer in selfreports than men, 19 and among DED patients women report worse health-related quality of life and perceived health than men. 6,9,21 As compared with men, women report a greater impact of DED on visual quality indicators, including poor vision, blurred vision, and fluctuating/unstable vision, as well as sustained visual attention tasks, including reading, night driving, television viewing, and computer/monitor work. 6  A study of 890 women 30-69 years of age found that Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (mean -SD) were worse in patients with DED (6.1 -2.9) versus without DED (4.9 -2.7); p = 0.003. 17 The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores (mean -SD) in the same study were worse in patients with DED 30-45 years of age (13.2 -6.0) than in those without DED (9.7 -6.0); p = 0.02. 17 A 2010-2011 analysis of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (a population-based crosssectional study) in 6,655 females was carried out to look at the association between DED signs and symptoms and depressive symptoms. 16 Across all respondents, 20% experienced DED symptoms, and DED prevalence from a confirmed diagnosis was 12.3%. Also, a DED diagnosis was associated with greater odds of experiencing anxiety and/or depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0), depressive mood (OR 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0), severe psychological stress (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.6-4.0), and of having had prior psychological counseling (OR 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0-3.1).", "n_publication_ref": 30, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Gender Differences in Care-seeking Behaviors and Health Care Service Utilization", "text": "Women have been found to interact more and differently with the health care system than men 118 in ways that offer opportunities for earlier detection, referral, preventative treatment, and/or diagnosis in the treatment of DED. Based on a survey of 1,518 women and 581 men who previously participated in the WHS 12 and PHS I and II, 39 more women than men reported using traditional DED therapies (level 1). 6 These included artificial tears (82.8% vs. 62.6%; p < 0.0001), lubricating eye ointments (19.2% vs. 11.7%; p < 0.0001), and hot compresses (14.3% vs. 10.7%; p < 0.02). 6 This is also true of the next tier of DED therapies (level 2); omega-3 fatty acids (18.6% vs. 9.6%; p = 0.0006), cyclosporine eye drops (13.4% vs. 6.4%; p < 0.0001), and punctal occlusion (15.0% vs. 9.1%; p = 0.005). 6 Overall, the same level of general satisfaction with DED treatments was reported, however, compared with men, women reported greater dissatisfaction with side effects of DED therapies and the amount of time for the treatment to alleviate symptoms. In an alternate model, dissatisfaction with the convenience of treatment use as instructed was less in women than in men (OR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.95). 6 Overall, compared with men, women may try a more diverse set of treatments, including nutritional supplements and other over-the-counter therapies. 119,120 Tear film homeostasis has been found to be dependent on adequate nutrition, particularly sufficient intake of protein and vitamin A. 121 A low-fat diet, rich in antioxidants and omega fatty acids, has previously been shown to benefit both the tear film and ocular surface, 122,123 leading many clinicians to recommend omega-3 fatty acids to patients to alleviate DED symptoms.\nSchaumberg et al. found that women use omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of their DED symptoms significantly more often than men. 6 A 2013 multicenter double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial of 38 postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe DED was conducted to measure the effect of supplementation with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on DED signs and symptoms. 124  were significantly improved compared with women taking placebo (N = 19); OSDI score 21 -4 vs. 34 -5; p = 0.05. Also at 24 weeks, conjunctival impression cytology measures of CD11c integrin and HLA-DR expression, both DED diseaserelevant inflammatory mediators, showed increases of >30% for placebo compared with supplement treatment ( p = 0.001). However, no differences between placebo and supplement treatment cohorts were found for tear production, tear breakup time, or corneal or conjunctival staining. 124 In the recently published Dry Eye Assessment and Management (DREAM) study, a large randomized clinical trial, 535 DED patients with moderate-to-severe DED were assigned 2:1 to receive ''active'' or placebo supplements over 12 months. 125 The active supplements contained 400 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 200 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, taken five times daily, for a total dose of 3,000 mg. Placebo capsules contained 1,000 mg of refined olive oil made up of 68% oleic acid (n-9), 13% palmitic acid (saturated), and 11% linoleic acid (n-6). Both active and placebo capsules contained an antioxidant; 3 mg of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). During the trial, patients were allowed to continue their current treatments for DED. While the data in this study were not stratified by sex/gender or age, females comprised >80% of the omega-3 and placebo cohorts and the mean age was 58 years. 125 After 12 months of treatment, signs and symptoms of DED improved significantly in both the active and placebo cohorts, with 53% of the active cohort and 57% of the placebo cohort reporting less use of additional treatments for their dry eye. Mean OSDI scores decreased by 13.9 -15.6 points for the active group and by 12.5 -18.2 points for the placebo group; however, the difference between groups was not significant ( p = 0.40). Based on between-group differences in changes from baseline to 12 months in OSDI score, corneal staining, tear break-up time, and Schirmer's test, the omega-3 supplement did not show additional benefit compared with placebo. The olive oil placebo capsules used in this study, which predominantly contained oleic acid, an omega-9 PUFA, was not expected to have an effect on the signs and symptoms of DED. 125 Methodological difficulties of the placebo effect in DED clinical trials of topical treatments have been previously reported. 126 A combined analysis of the placebo arms of three clinical trials of diquafosol treatment for DED carried out in Japan, comprised of 205 DED patients (82.4% female with a mean -SD age of 54.4 -17.9) found high baseline scores, indicating increased DED severity, and aging to be predictive of the magnitude of placebo response. 126 ", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "DED can be a complex and time-consuming condition to manage, and some individuals with DED experience refractory symptoms. It is well supported that the sex and gender differences between women and men, especially as they age, contribute to differences in the prevalence and severity of DED.\nIn this study, we have reviewed sex and gender differences in DED causes, clinical sign presentation, patient experience of symptoms, and-perhaps most relevantly-differences in treatment response and efficacy. While some of these differences are biological, with sex-specific hormones having a great effect on DED etiology, there are also comorbidities and gender-based factors that contribute to DED risk in women.\nBecause there is a strong association of autoimmune diseases and DED, especially those that primarily affect women, both systemic and overall effects of DED need to be assessed in treatment options of DED and comorbidities. The high burden of comorbidities women with DED face suggests they would benefit from an interdisciplinary approach to DED treatment. Women are diagnosed with DED at earlier ages, and progression to severe forms of the disease is more prevalent in women than men. Thus, earlier diagnosis of DED in women may result in a significant improvement in their quality of life.\nIn light of the many women's health topics raised here with associations to DED, opportunities for educating women and health care providers on this highly prevalent and burdensome disease should be maximized; and when dry eye is suspected, referral to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a dry eye examination is warranted.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Contributions", "text": "All authors participated in the development of the intellectual content, provided important critique for each revision, and gave approval for the final version of this article.

The objective of this population-based survey was to characterize symptom burden, patient awareness, and treatment decision-making for fibroids, including a comparison among women of varying backgrounds. Materials and Methods: Women ( \u202118 years) were recruited via email from GfK KnowledgePanel \u00d2 , a representative panel of US households, or identified with opt-in consumer panels. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire and Aberdeen Menorrhagia Severity Scale (AMSS) were included. Results: Eligible women were grouped into three cohorts: ''at-risk'' (symptoms suggestive of fibroids without clinical diagnosis, n = 300), ''diagnosed'' (n = 871), and fibroid-related ''hysterectomy'' (n = 272). Cohort and intracohort race/ethnicity and income analyses revealed differences in symptom burden, awareness/perception, and treatment history. Based on UFS-QOL scores, at-risk women reported significantly greater symptom severity and decreased health-related QOL versus diagnosed women; Hispanic women reported greater symptom severity versus white and black women. At-risk women also reported heavy menstrual bleeding and significant impact on work productivity. Among diagnosed women, 71% used pharmacologic therapy for symptom relief, and 30% underwent surgical or procedural treatment. Initial discussions with healthcare providers significantly impacted treatment outcomes; the hysterectomy cohort was most likely to first discuss hysterectomy. Conclusions: Women with fibroids or symptoms suggestive of fibroids experience significant distress that reduces QOL, particularly racial minorities and women in lower income brackets.

The survey contained two parts: the Screener (used to identify eligibility) and the Main Questionnaire (Fig. 1).\nThe Screener assessed fibroid and hysterectomy history, as well as symptoms suggestive of fibroids in women without a clinical diagnosis via general health-related questions and two standardized disease-specific instruments: the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire 18 (1-month recall version 19 ) and select questions from the Aberdeen Menorrhagia Severity Scale (AMSS) for heavy menstrual bleeding. 20 Women who had a hysterectomy or had gone through menopause were not administered the UFS-QOL and AMSS. The UFS-QOL-a validated 37-item questionnaire to assess fibroid-specific symptom severity and health-related quality of life-is considered a sensitive measure of disease severity and treatment effect. 18 The UFS-QOL includes a Symptom Severity score (range: 0-100; higher scores indicate greater symptom severity) and a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Total Score (range: 0-100; higher scores indicating better HRQOL; consisting of six subscales: Concern, Activities, Energy/Mood, Control, Self-Consciousness, and Sexual Function). The AMSS is a validated 15-item questionnaire to assess the severity of bleeding that occurs during menses and between cycles (higher scores indicate greater severity). 20 To limit survey duration, 9 of the 15 original AMSS questions were assessed in the Screener (nonvalidated); the maximum raw score (29) was converted to a maximum score of 100, with higher scores indicating greater bleeding severity. Severe or moderate fibroids were defined based on a combination of the UFS-QOL and AMSS bleeding scales using literature benchmarks 18,20 (Fig. 1).\nFollowing completion of the Screener, eligible participants were grouped into three analysis cohorts based on self-reported information: women who experienced symptoms suggestive of uterine fibroids without a clinical diagnosis (''at-risk cohort''), women diagnosed with fibroids (''diagnosed cohort''), and women with hysterectomy due to fibroids (''hysterectomy cohort''); eligibility for inclusion is detailed in Figure 1. Only eligible participants received the Main Questionnaire; those who did not qualify did not proceed with the survey.\nThe Main Questionnaire included questions related to menstrual symptoms and fibroids (i.e., diagnosis and treatment journey, hysterectomy journey, at-risk journey, and unmet needs), as well as overall health. Participants answered additional questions on HRQOL (e.g., 36-Item Short Form Survey [SF-36]; each subscale is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life 21 ), work-related impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire 22 ; 4 percentage scores were calculated as described by Reilly Associates, 23 with higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity), healthcare provider relationship, costs and insurance coverage, and information-seeking behavior.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Raw data were adjusted based on the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates (2010-2014) 24 to more accurately reflect the composition of US adult women; sample weights were adjusted based on participant demographics: age, race, ethnicity, education, income, Internet at home, census region, and residence.

Among diagnosed women, 71% have tried some form of pharmacologic therapy, including prescription treatments, over-the-counter pain relief, iron supplements, and hormonal contraceptives. In addition, 30% have undergone some form of surgery or procedure, with most electing endometrial ablation or myomectomy. Among all women who went to a healthcare provider for symptoms related to their fibroids, those who had undergone a hysterectomy were significantly more likely to discuss hysterectomy as a treatment option at first discussion compared with diagnosed women (60% vs. 16%, respectively), while those who had not undergone hysterectomy were more likely to discuss birth control pills (43% vs. 28%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2).\nAmong women who discussed their fibroids with a healthcare provider, 20% of women in the diagnosed cohort and 15% of women in the hysterectomy cohort had been prescribed a pharmacologic treatment at their first discussion; the majority were prescribed birth control pills (69% and 59%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S3). With respect to first discussion, no significant racial/ethnic or income disparities were noted among women who underwent a hysterectomy (data not shown). In contrast, women in the diagnosed cohort compared with the hysterectomy cohort were significantly more likely to have discussed pharmacologic treatments such as birth control pills (43% vs. 28%, respectively) or over-the-counter pain relief (19% vs. 13%, respectively) at first discussion. White and black women in the diagnosed cohort were significantly more likely to have first discussed a hysterectomy compared with Hispanic women (17% and 21% vs. 8%), while Hispanic women were significantly more likely to have discussed birth control pills (51%) than white women (39%).\nThe mean age of women who underwent a hysterectomy to treat fibroids was 41 years, regardless of race, ethnicity, or income level (mean range: 40-42 years). Approximately 11% of women had a hysterectomy before age 35. The leading reasons for opting for hysterectomy were recommendations from a healthcare provider (58%) and significant pain (55%) and distress (47%) due to symptoms. One in three women who had undergone a hysterectomy said that they would have been somewhat interested to extremely interested in a uterus-preserving option with roughly half desiring to maintain the ability to have children (Supplementary Fig. S4). Black women (40%) were significantly more likely to express interest in uterus-preserving options than white women (26%). Among women who reported interest in a uterus-preserving option, black women were significantly more likely to respond that they still wanted the option to have children compared with white women (69% vs. 21%, respectively).\nOverall, women in all three cohorts cited relief from heavy bleeding as the most important aspect of fibroid treatment (other options included reduction of fibroid size, regain energy/relief, preserve fertility, stop all bleeding within 1 week, and relief from pelvic tightness or pressure). Women in the diagnosed cohort also reported a high desire for treatment to reduce fibroid size, while at-risk women reported a high desire to regain energy and experience relief from fatigue. FIG. 4.

Of those diagnosed without a hysterectomy, 71% tried some form of pharmacologic treatment, which extrapolates to approximately 2.7 million women. An additional 3% of undiagnosed women experienced moderate-to-severe symptoms suggestive of fibroids, adding 3.7 million women also potentially affected. Therefore, fibroid prevalence is likely higher than currently reported.\nWomen diagnosed with fibroids who did not undergo hysterectomy are heavily burdened by their symptoms, including reduced quality of life. While nearly three-quarters of the diagnosed cohort received pharmacologic treatment, these women reported lower mean scores on seven of eight SF-36 subscales compared to the hysterectomy cohort. Although treatment selection (pharmacologic and/or surgical) depends on patient perception of symptom severity and impact on quality of life, the most commonly prescribed treatments reported in this study are consistent with pharmacologic therapies reported in prior studies. 26 Women with severe quality of life burden likely seek permanent treatment through hysterectomy. Given the HRQOL gap between the diagnosed and hysterectomy cohorts, an unmet need persists in fibroid therapy.\nWomen who underwent hysterectomy for fibroids reported suffering with symptoms for years before diagnosis and often quickly decided to undergo hysterectomy. These data also demonstrate that initial healthcare provider recommendations matched treatment course, highlighting the impact of these initial discussions. Interestingly, the decision to pursue hysterectomy did not appear to strongly correlate with age or parity status. Furthermore, consistent with previous survey results, 15 black women were more interested in uterine-preserving options. Preserving the ability to have children, relieving symptoms (specifically heavy bleeding), and regaining energy represent significant unmet needs for fibroid treatment.\nFibroid burden may also extend to undiagnosed women experiencing symptoms suggestive of fibroids. These at-risk women reported bleeding more than what they considered normal and rated their quality of life as severely impacted, yet few had consulted a healthcare provider. These results underscore previous studies showing that women often delay medical help despite high symptom burden. 7,8,14 Based on self-reported averages of 8.5 years of symptoms, women in the at-risk cohort began experiencing fibroid-like symptoms around age 25. In addition, these women reported more severe symptom impact compared with women in the other two cohorts. Hispanic women, underrepresented in fibroid surveys, comprised nearly one-third of this at-risk cohort and reported significantly higher Symptom Severity scores compared with white and black women. It should be noted, however, that atrisk women were identified based on UFS-QOL and AMSS scores (e.g., higher symptom severity, lower quality of life, and heavy bleeding) and may have other diseases (e.g., ovulatory dysfunction and adenomyosis) that obscure fibroid symptom identification. Awareness is also low in this at-risk population, with only about half of women having heard of fibroids. Women of racial/ethnic minorities and in lower income brackets are less likely to be aware versus white women, which may be compounded by inadequate access to care.\nComparisons based upon race or ethnicity are difficult to characterize, in part, due to lack of comparative data within racially/ethnically diverse populations in the literature and uniform under-representation or characterization of minority women in clinical studies. One systematic review showed that three-quarters of fibroid-related studies did not report race, and in the remaining studies, representation of black women was lower than expected based on US census data. 27 Our results are strengthened by the unique inclusion of relatively high numbers of black and Hispanic women, demonstrating that symptom severity and distress may differ between groups.\nSubjective retrospective data may be impacted by response bias, as the survey explored sensitive topics and requested recollection of possibly distant medical information. The survey is also unable to capture cases of asymptomatic fibroids that are likely undiagnosed. Unfinished surveys could have led to less robust sampling, and nonresponder bias could have impacted survey results. Finally, diagnosed and at-risk cohorts were included in the general population; because the patient cohorts were not mutually exclusive, this could have led to more conservative results in this general population comparator group.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Women with fibroids or symptoms suggestive of fibroids experience significant distress that negatively affects quality of life, particularly impacting racial/ethnic minorities and women in lower income brackets.

Given evidence suggesting fibroids are likely underdiagnosed, routine patientprovider discussions should include signs and symptoms of fibroids. Healthcare providers should focus on lower income and minority populations as they are less aware of fibroids, more likely to self-treat, and may carry greater symptom burden compared with higher income or white women.

The Learning Community model was based on systems change, through multistate peer-to-peer learning and strategy-sharing activities. This study uses interview data from 13 participating state teams to identify state-implemented strategies within defined domains that support policy implementation. Materials and Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted by the ASTHO team with state team members participating in the Learning Community. Interviews were transcribed and implementation strategies were coded. Using qualitative analysis, the state-reported domains with the most strategies were identified. Results: The five leading domains included the following: stakeholder partnerships; provider training; outreach; payment streams/reimbursement; and data, monitoring and evaluation. Stakeholder partnership was identified as a cross-cutting domain. Every state team used strategies for stakeholder partnerships and provider training, 12 reported planning or engaging in outreach efforts, 11 addressed provider and facility reimbursement, and 10 implemented data evaluation strategies. All states leveraged partnerships to support information sharing, identify provider champions, and pilot immediate postpartum LARC programs in select delivery facilities. Conclusions: Implementing immediate postpartum LARC policies in states involves leveraging partnerships to develop and implement strategies.

[2][3][4][5][6][7] Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC; intrauterine devices [IUDs] and contraceptive implants) is the most effective form of reversible contraception, and may be more convenient for women than user-dependent methods (e.g., pill, patch, ring, and condom) because it does not require frequent repeat visits to a health care provider, action on a weekly or daily basis, or with every act of intercourse/coitus. 8,9 Integrating LARC into women's preventive health and reproductive services' options may improve birth outcomes by reducing unintended pregnancies. 10 Although LARC use has steadily increased since 2002, in 2014, only 14% of women aged 15-44 years using contraception were using a LARC method. 11,12 However, use of LARC by postpartum women (i.e., up to 6 months postdelivery) aged 15-44 years is higher, potentially impacted by availability of insurance coverage or services during the postpartum period (e.g., Medicaid or other time-limited insurance plans), opportunity for contraceptive services during engagement with the health system, and motivation to avoid rapid repeat or unintended pregnancy. 10,[13][14][15][16][17] Moreover, the US Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use indicates implants are safe and effective for postpartum women and IUDs can safely be inserted immediately postpartum (i.e., 10 minutes after delivery of the placenta) with continuation rates similar to LARC insertions at other times. [18][19][20] Finally, immediate postpartum LARC is costeffective, saving up to $280,000 by preventing 88 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women over 2 years. [21][22][23] Recognizing these benefits, some states have implemented statewide policies to increase access to LARC immediately postpartum. However, there are numerous barriers to provision of immediate postpartum LARC including issues of provider training, reimbursement, device availability, and ensuring adequate and informed client-centered counseling. [24][25][26][27][28][29][30] To understand the successes and challenges of immediate postpartum LARC policy implementation, and identify barriers and facilitators to statewide policy uptake, a group of states participated in a national activity to share experiences from implementing statewide systems change. Beginning in 2014, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) convened the Immediate Postpartum LARC Learning Community (described as the LC throughout the article), a cross-state collaboration to facilitate information sharing and support states in improving access to immediate postpartum LARC through policy implementation, in collaboration with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 31 The purpose of this article is to describe the strategies used by LC state teams to facilitate implementation of immediate postpartum LARC policies at the state level, to inform other states considering similar policy implementation.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "ASTHO utilized a learning community model consisting of the following: (1) developing cohesive state teams, (2) holding an in-person meeting to identify successes and challenges in implementing policy changes, (3) presenting virtual peer-to-peer learning sessions, (4) encouraging stateto-state collaboration and information sharing, (5) collecting baseline key informant interview data, and (6) developing resources for state use. 31 A total of 13 states (i.e., Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas) participated in the LC over 2 years (2014)(2015)(2016). States selected for participation in the LC had either implemented a statewide immediate postpartum LARC policy or had developed innovative processes to provide reimbursement outside the bundled postpartum services reimbursement. Some state policies were recently approved indicating early efforts of implementation, whereas others had previous policies in place, giving them more implementation experience. Each state developed a core team consisting of state leadership, including state health officials, Medicaid medical directors, directors of maternal and child health or family planning programs, hospital administrators, and clinical provider champions.\nThe LC was evaluated using an implementation science framework. This framework offered a methodology for understanding strategy development, adoption, and sustainability of clinical practices and public health program interventions. 32 Implementation strategies, based on the framework, measure multilayered social interventions and offer assessment of complex systems at multiple levels, service settings, staff interaction or training, and practice. Strategies were grouped by domains, previously identified by state teams that included the following: provider training; payment streams and reimbursement; informed consent and client-centered counseling; stocking and supply of devices; outreach; stakeholder partnerships; service availability in rural or smaller facilities; and data, monitoring, and evaluation. Further detail about the implementation of the LC and synthesis of information into domains is provided elsewhere. 31 Semistructured key informant interviews were conducted in groups through teleconference with participating state team members. Preliminary results of initial informal interviews with state teams at an earlier in-person meeting provided the framework for the key informant interviews that took place between November 2015 and March 2016. Interview questions were grouped by domain and were designed to solicit more detailed information on state-implemented strategies. Some strategies were previously mentioned by states, and the interviews allowed for a more detailed discussion. Interviews were designed and conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), a part of the ASTHO team. If any state team members were unavailable during the interview, a follow-up interview with absent members was conducted to ensure full representation of the state team. The interview guide was organized by domain (Table 1) and included questions assessing barriers, facilitators, and strategies within each domain. A detailed description of the data collection process has been described elsewhere. 33 Audio recordings of key informant interviews from the 13 state teams were transcribed, and excerpts were extracted, deidentified, coded, and aggregated by state.\nExcerpts describing implementation strategies were identified and independently coded by strategy into eight LC domains (Table 1). 31,34 Validation checks were performed and codes assigned to excerpts were reviewed for consistency. Lead researchers met to review, discuss, and resolve discrepancies identified in coding. Strategies in each domain were reviewed, disagreement in interpretation noted, and then resolved through consensus discussion.\nThe number of states implementing strategies in each domain was counted. Domains with strategies used by the most states were identified, including a cross-cutting domain embedded within other domains.

Most often, state teams implemented partnership-focused strategies within the domains of payment streams and reimbursement (8 of 13 states) and provider training (7 states; data not given). As payment streams and reimbursement changes require the partnership and support of the state health department, clinical facilities, device manufacturers, and insurers including the state Medicaid agency, the cross-cutting strategy of stakeholder partnerships was necessary to assure policy implementation throughout a state. Strategies included consistent communication with insurers, primarily Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care Organizations, to implement changes in encounter rates, fees, and reimbursements (Table 3). State teams also developed strategies to partner with other in-state programs, identify state initiatives that promote health outcomes linked to improved contraceptive use (infant health, etc.), and better engage executive leadership of facilities to enhance policy implementation. One state described how partnership was essential in implementing a statewide process in facilities: I'm wondering, if [to] make this commitment go to a larger number of hospitals that are actively doing this-that's why I'm glad we had a presentation last week where the CEOs were in the room. It's almost like you need to have that administrative clinical partnership for it to work. You need the clinical champion, and you need a senior person in a hospital that are working together. As we go back out now, hopefully, it'll be easier for us to get the other partners, other people in the room, so to speak, that will need to make sure this happens in the hospital, so the coding folks get a comfort level. We work with the pharmacy folks to figure out the best way to make it easy for access, and we have a strong clinical champion that's driving that forward.\nStakeholder partnerships provided additional opportunities to enhance education and training of providers in immediate postpartum LARC insertion. State teams described engaging national clinical membership organizations to support information and resource sharing for state and facility clinical champions (Table 3). One state team described how provider champions in the state are well-positioned to engage stakeholders across various settings:\nOur main clinical champion [is] our chair of the state ACOG [chapter], a professor, and the Medicaid medical director. She has great reach through those different professional streams.\nState teams partnered with academic institutions to promote provider training in teaching hospitals and collaborated with nonprofit agencies to obtain resources for provider training in facilities.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Provider training", "text": "A range of activities were developed to support provider training, including skill-building activities for specialists, subspecialists, and nonclinical staff on topics ranging from IUD insertion techniques on the immediate postpartum uterus to accurate administrative and pharmacy billing and coding (Table 3). Implementation strategies for strengthening clinical practices consisted of hands-on training using pelvic models and simulators, providing resources to clinical staff addressing misperceptions about LARC safety and effectiveness (e.g., US MEC, US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use [US SPR], and the Recommendations for Providing Quality Family Planning Services [QFP]), and telehealth training for remote service provision. 8,36,37 State teams noted the relationship between well-trained providers and patient outcomes:\nMaking sure that residents and clinicians are well trained in LARC placement postpartum is something that we really want to focus on because of the connection with expulsion rates of LARC, and the experienced providers or clinicians having lower expulsion rates.\nMany state teams emphasized identifying and engaging provider champions to disseminate tools and information on immediate postpartum LARC in facilities. State teams also acknowledged the importance of champions in clinical and nonclinical roles to support the implementation of immediate postpartum LARC policies:\nIt seems like every hospital that we work with should have a physician champion and then an administrative, roll up their sleeve person to drive the real work.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Outreach", "text": "State teams described outreach as the recruitment of stakeholders supportive of immediate postpartum LARC policy implementation, and an increase in communication activities engaging the public on LARC.

State teams also shared resources on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods for postpartum women to providers and hospital staff, as expressed by one state team:\nWe proactively provided people with the CDC's Medical Eligibility Criteria with a practice recommendation that really do support an immediate post-placental, postpartum placement even if that's not what the [product label] says.we also have some literature that can also reinforce those conversations to make that process a little bit easier. Some state teams focused outreach efforts on public health education programs and social media campaigns. One state team described engaging women from a specific region of the state in focus groups to discuss perceptions of LARC methods, then providing feedback to the local facility:  quite astonishing the myths that surround LARCs right now, and shows how much work we have to do.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Payment streams and reimbursements", "text": "State teams emphasized strategy development for identifying streamlined processes for facility and provider reimbursement of contraceptive devices and insertion fees. Teams approached the reimbursement process in two ways: (1) developing resources for understanding the process of reimbursing for services, and (2) engaging insurers and manufacturers in discussions about service costs (Table 3). To understand current processes, state teams developed resources, clarification letters, policy memoranda, and medical bulletins to explain device purchase, inventory, coding, and reimbursement for devices in facilities:\nOur ACOG president [has] been sending out bulletins and sort of spotlight[ing] on Medicaid. As soon as we finish this LARC one-pager about how to order, what's the reimbursement, what's the coding, what do the pharmacies buy, each of the five health plans.we'll send it to every member. It's just a lot for a provider to understand. Some state teams described piloting resources, including billing and coding protocols or toolkits, in one or more facilities before promoting use among all facilities. Once current processes were understood, state teams recommended changes to the system by collaborating with the state Medicaid agency or managed care organizations to identify carvein or carve-out populations for services, negotiate capitation rates for device purchases, develop state plan amendment language, and engage provider champions to facilitate clinical discussions. One state team described the process of working with the state Medicaid agency in detail:\nOnce we get CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] approval-we will be required to get CMS approval on the SPA [State Plan Amendment] change in order to carve out these devices from our inpatient hospitals. Once we get those and the methods of payment associated, we are really gonna strongly depend on our colleagues at [the health department] to help us inform those champions and those providers on how to actually do the billing. We also recognize that we're gonna have to work with administration and hopefully the pharmacies at these facilities, too.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data, monitoring, and evaluation", "text": "State teams focused on strategies to access the data necessary to measure uptake of immediate postpartum LARC in facilities, develop quality assurance and improvement indicators, and evaluate policy implementation efforts. Many states worked with the state Medicaid agencies to ensure access to Medicaid claims data at the state level. State teams proposed linkage of claims data to other data systems to provide the basis for examining associations between contraceptive use and other maternal and child health outcomes such as birth spacing, unintended pregnancy, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admissions, or preterm birth (Table 3). For those state teams with challenges to accessing administrative claims data, other proxy measures were identified to measure policy uptake (e.g., number of providers trained in LARC insertion, number of facilities providing immediate postpartum LARC):\nWe recognized early on that our baseline data couldn't be the number of IUDs and implants placed because we just weren't there yet.Our approach was to collect on other things that might show some sort of progress or forward movement on that idea of implementing at the institutional level. How many places have gotten through the pharmacy? What percentage of clinicians who can deliver at your institution have also received training? Similar kind of data point for nurses who are on Labor and Delivery [L&D]? What kind of other stakeholders will be directly involved and need to have some elements of training? Those kinds of things.\nMany state teams initiated cost benefit and effectiveness analyses. Several states established data work groups to analyze or evaluate data outcomes:\nWe have our own internal experts really looking at the number of births that didn't happen and the effects of those births that didn't happen on other public support programs, like Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants Children [WIC], TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families], Childcare Assistance Program. We have about eight different programs we're looking at some cost avoidance analysis on.\nThe domains of stocking and supply of devices, service locations, and informed consent were not identified as domains with large numbers of strategies, but were considered important areas of focus for further strategy development by state teams (Table 2).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Of the eight domains for implementation of strategies to increase uptake of immediate postpartum LARC policies, states developed most strategies to address barriers in the areas of provider training, outreach, payment streams and reimbursement, and data, monitoring, and evaluation; stakeholder partnerships were identified as cross-cutting among these domains. Fewer states implemented strategies in the domains of stocking and supply of devices, service locations, and informed consent, indicating less focus on these areas during the LC. Using partnership itself as a strategy furthered development and implementation of strategies in other domains.\nStates offered numerous examples of strategies requiring partnership for successful implementation. Public health partnership as a strategy to implement policy change is evident at the community level through participatory research, collective impact, and academic partnership. [38][39][40] Fewer efforts exist at the state level, as coordination of collaboration among public health agencies is complicated and requires long-term, sustained efforts, often difficult with continuous changes in administrations. 41 Recognizing the complexity of the clinical and public health system, ASTHO used the LC as the platform for states to initiate and strengthen stakeholder partnership, a model for networking across state agencies and organizations, and as a lever to achieving successful policy implementation. 33 States identified and used strategies such as provider champions and pilot facilities to engage stakeholders in the process of policy uptake.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Provider champions and implementation of pilot sites", "text": "Provider champions (e.g., clinical, nonclinical, or change agents with the knowledge, experience, and training to support applying evidence into practice) 42 in a health setting were described as a ''driving force behind the implementation'' of activities or policy changes promoting favorable perception of particular clinical practices necessitating organizational change. [43][44][45][46][47] State teams identified champions as necessary for strategy implementation in all domains except informed consent, and data, monitoring, and evaluation, indicating a critical need. In the context of the LC, these providers championed device purchasing at facilities, led LARC insertion training and information sharing on best practices, worked with provider groups to increase uptake of immediate postpartum LARC in facilities (e.g., residency programs in teaching hospitals), and garnered buy-in from hospital administration. Champions were noted to function at two different levels-state and facility. State-level champions built administrative consensus to implement immediate postpartum LARC practices statewide, whereas facility-level champions utilized professional credibility and standing within facilities to establish protocols addressing institutional barriers. [48][49][50][51] Some state teams tested strategies before statewide implementation through single-site pilot testing. Teams partnered with single facilities to develop protocols to define, test, and adapt key processes, including reimbursement and stocking and supply strategies. State teams expanded on these approaches by developing pilot protocols adapted for smaller and rural facilities and clinics focused on provider training, reimbursement for services, and availability of devices, which were identified as barriers in previous studies. 30,52,53 In addition, state teams developed indicators of immediate postpartum LARC uptake, evaluating facility administration perceptions of provider experiences, and conducting cost projection, benefit, and effectiveness analyses. Results were disseminated statewide in toolkits for other facilities to use in policy implementation.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Areas of focus for further strategy development", "text": "Only half of state teams described efforts focused on stocking and supply of devices, six focused on strategy development for rural or smaller facilities, and two implemented efforts on client-centered counseling and informed consent. The high and increasing cost of devices are institutional barriers to stocking devices at facilities, 54,55 which in turn may influence contraceptive counseling strategies and provision. 56,57 Not surprisingly, providers are less likely to counsel clients on contraceptive methods that are not available at their clinic location or through referral networks. 58 To encourage adequate stocking of LARC devices in facilities, state teams engaged facility pharmacies to add LARC to inpatient formularies, leveraged relationships with providers to promote stocking in hospitals, developed protocols for hospital staff on medication ordering and purchasing procedures, and encouraged hospital administration to stock LARC proximal to maternity units. Administrative and logistical issues like stocking and supply may be next steps in the implementation process, as only states successfully working in almost all other domains were focused on this area.\nBeeson et al. identified evidence of limited access to contraceptive implants in rural areas. 30 Access to contraception in rural areas may be influenced by the training and capacity of clinic staff (e.g., presence of an obstetrician/ gynecologist), funding mechanisms (e.g., earmarked family planning funding), and patient knowledge and acceptance of contraceptive methods. 30,52 In some states, limited opportunities to interact with the health care system may influence women's decisions to use highly effective contraceptive methods. 59 To increase contraception access for specific populations including services in rural or remote areas, teams leveraged existing residency programs to provide funds for stocking of devices and other resources for family planning services.\nState teams may benefit from facility development of informed consent protocols on inpatient LARC insertion. State teams acknowledged that facilities should train providers on applying ethical and client-centered contraceptive counseling on all contraceptive method options, following ACOG guidance for informed consent. 60 Many state teams recognized a need to strengthen resources on informed consent and confidentiality for inpatient LARC insertion by focusing on development of protocols that use a reproductive justice framework within the comprehensive contraceptive counseling process. 34 There are some limitations to the interpretation of these findings. First, these findings represent states that reported enacting activities across the eight domains. It is possible that more states are engaged in such activities, but did not describe these efforts in the interviews. Second, these data may not be generalizable to the entire United States, as we only interviewed the 13 states participating in the LC. Despite this limitation, we included states with varying degrees of resources, health department structures, at different stages of implementing immediate postpartum LARC policy, and from different geographic regions across the country. Third, we interviewed in a team setting, rather than individually with each team member. This method allowed for observation of group interaction, but may have influenced individual responses. Finally, we do not measure the impact of implementation strategies, as the LC was not designed to test differences among states that do and do not implement strategies.\nProctor et al. recommend implementation strategies be clear in description, operational definition, and measurement. 32 Successful strategies result in improvement of feasibility, cost, penetrability, and sustainability. 61 Although the LC was not designed to test implementation strategies, the LC evaluation attempts to define, operationalize, and justify each strategy within each domain. These results describe the benefits of using state-developed strategies to support immediate postpartum LARC policy implementation. The findings from this descriptive study suggest that leveraging partnerships is a cross-cutting strategy for advancing implementation efforts that increase access to immediate postpartum LARC. Results also provide examples of domains in which strategies were implemented to address barriers to immediate postpartum LARC uptake and areas of focus for future strategy development. Further research quantifying feasibility, adherence, and sustainability of strategies implemented may help support policy change.\nThe LC provided an environment for state teams to discuss strategies most often related to increasing provider training, outreach, payment streams and reimbursement, and data, monitoring, and evaluation. To ensure that all clients have access to confidential and ethical reproductive health services regardless of birthing facility location, more states may IMMEDIATE POSTPARTUM LARC STATE STRATEGIES consider stocking devices in all types of facilities and strengthening informed consent protocols. Provider champions may serve to promote evidence-based client-centered contraceptive counseling, increase training and capacity of facilities based in rural and underserved areas, and promote on-site stocking of LARC in hospitals. Pilot testing of toolkits and protocols can inform scale-up of policies throughout a state, and measurement of program impact provides the data necessary to replicate and adapt a policy framework in diverse settings. Providing LARC immediately postpartum is a convenient and cost-effective strategy to optimize birth spacing and reduce unintended pregnancy for women who are actively engaged in the health care system; states may consider these identified strategies to facilitate policy implementation and increase access to contraception and preventive health services.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors acknowledge the members of all state teams participating in the LC from Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas.

Satisfaction Among Midlife Women: A Qualitative Study", "abstract": "Background: Women often undergo physical changes during the menopause transition, but the relationship between body image and sexual function in midlife is unclear. We used a qualitative approach to explore how body image relates to sexual function and satisfaction in midlife women. Materials and Methods: We conducted 19 individual interviews and 3 focus groups (total N = 39) among sexually active women 45-60 years of age using a semistructured guide. Sessions were audiorecorded and transcribed. Two investigators developed a codebook using an iterative process; the primary investigator then coded all data. Codes relating to body image were examined to identify key themes. Results: The mean age was 58 (range 46-59); 54% were White, 36% Black, and 10% were of another race. Most (72%) were peri-or postmenopausal. All but two women identified as heterosexual. Feeling attractive was an important reason for sexual activity. Changes in appearance, especially weight gain and breast changes, were common among these women. Women's body image impacted their sexual satisfaction; women who felt selfconscious about their bodies reported that these concerns had a negative impact on their sexual satisfaction, whereas women who felt confident discussed better sexual satisfaction, even in the face of bodily changes. Black women were more likely to discuss feeling confident than White women. Conclusions: Feeling attractive is important to sexual satisfaction in midlife women. Bodily changes, especially weight gain, are common during midlife. While many women are self-conscious about their appearance, some women develop increased self-acceptance. Supporting positive body image may help midlife women maintain sexual satisfaction with aging.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "S exuality is an important component of the quality of life to many women as they age. 1 The majority of midlife (approximate age  women are sexually active, and sex remains important to them. 1,2 However, prior studies suggest that negative changes in sexual function as women move through midlife are common. [3][4][5][6] Reasons for these negative changes in sexual function may include biological (e.g., decreases in sex hormones), psychological (e.g., development of mood symptoms), interpersonal (e.g., sexual dysfunction in a sexual part-ner), and sociocultural (e.g., negative stigma around sexuality in older women) processes. In addition, many women experience changes in their bodies, 4,7 including weight gain or redistribution of weight 8 ; changes in sexual organs such as sagging of breasts 8,9 and vaginal changes 10 ; and changes in their face and hair, such as the development of wrinkles or gray hair. 9 These changes potentially impact a woman's body image, defined as a person's perceptions of the esthetics or attractiveness of her own body, 11 and in turn her sexual function and satisfaction.\nModels of female sexual response can help healthcare providers and researchers more deeply understand and contextualize changes in sexual function. While prior models focused on physical aspects, a newer model, proposed by Rosemary Basson, highlights both physical and emotional aspects of female sexual response. 12 This model emphasizes that sexual desire is often triggered, not spontaneous, for women. A woman's feelings about her own body and attractiveness may be an important aspect of whether or not desire occurs for her. This model also highlights that participating in sexual activity results in not only physical outcomes, but also emotional outcomes, both of which are important to women. Feelings of attractiveness may be part of these emotional outcomes.\nWhile body dissatisfaction and negative body image are extremely common among women, [13][14][15][16] including midlife and older women, [17][18][19][20] body image does not necessarily worsen as women age. 13,15,16,21,22 In fact, the importance of personal appearance to women decreases with age. 21,22 Prior findings indicate that as women get older, they are less likely to compare themselves to other women, 13 self-monitor their bodies, 21 or worry about attractiveness. 23 When selecting an ideal body, college-aged women tend to select a thinner figure than do older women. 24 As one author put it, as women age, ''physical appearance is no longer such a central part of who they are.'' 22 In theory, this shift could potentially permit women to feel less self-conscious during sexual activity, thereby improving their sexual satisfaction.\nThere are differences between Black women and White women with regard to body image. Black women consistently report more positive body image than White women, even at higher weights. 15,[25][26][27][28][29] Black women more likely believe men prefer heavier women 26,27,30 and are more likely to report being at an ideal weight than White women. [31][32][33] However, many Black women still feel self-conscious about their bodies and engage in self-monitoring and attempts to lose weight, 34,35 and a more recent meta-analysis suggests that ethnic differences in body image are not as vast as previously thought. 36 These studies highlight the importance of including a diverse sample when studying body image in women.\nThe relationship between body image and sexual function has been examined in prior quantitative studies, but most were conducted among college-aged women, not midlife women, and these studies are often limited by the use of nonvalidated measures of body image, sexual function, and sexual satisfaction. In the literature among younger women, negative body image was correlated with sexual problems, sexual dysfunction, and sexual dissatisfaction. [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44] However, in the limited literature among midlife women, findings were mixed. In two studies, no associations were found between body image and sexual satisfaction, particularly after controlling for other factors (such as menopausal and mood symptoms). 13,45 The third study did find a correlation between self-reported declines in attractiveness and perceived declines in sexual function, but no relationship between selfreported declines in attractiveness and sexual satisfaction. 46 This third study did not use validated measures.\nBecause they use standardized questions and answer choices, quantitative studies may overlook nuances and individual variations in women's experiences. Qualitative research allows women to speak at length, using their own words, to describe aspects of phenomena that are most relevant to them. To our knowledge, no qualitative studies have specifically addressed the role of body image in sexual function and satisfaction in midlife women. In this study, our aim was to use individual interviews and focus groups to explore the role of body image in sexual function and satisfaction in a racially diverse group of women 45-60 years of age.", "n_publication_ref": 62, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "We recruited women from the general population of Pittsburgh, PA in 2014 and 2015. Women were recruited using flyers placed in community spaces and doctors' offices; social media advertisements; online newsletters; and the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) research registry. Interested women contacted the study team and were screened for eligibility over the telephone. We included women who were 45-60 years old and had any partnered sexual activity in the prior 12 months. Sexual activity was broadly defined and included penetrative sex, oral sex, and intimate touching. Eligible women could choose to participate in either an individual interview or a focus group. Individual interviews allowed women who do not feel comfortable speaking in a group to participate, while focus groups allowed researchers to potentially uncover unique themes due to group synergy. We used both to obtain a variety of perspectives.\nAt the beginning of each interview or focus group, an informed consent script was read to the potential participant. This script highlighted that participation was voluntary and could be discontinued at any time; that all information would be kept confidential; and outlined potential risks and benefits of the study. Women could then choose to remain and participate in the study or leave. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved this study.\nAll interviews and focus groups were conducted by a facilitator (M.H.) with extensive training and experience in qualitative research involving sensitive subject matters. The facilitator took minimal notes during interviews, while the principal investigator (H.N.T.) sat in the corner during focus groups and took notes, but did not participate in any discussion; the principal investigator was not present at interviews. Both interviews and focus groups lasted *60 minutes and followed a semistructured interview guide (Supplementary Data; Supplementary Data are available online at www .liebertpub.com/jwh). Consistent with the emergent nature of qualitative research, not all questions on the interview guide were asked of every participant, and some participants may have been asked follow-up questions not included in the interview guide. The overall study was focused broadly on sexual function and satisfaction in midlife women, with some specific probing questions regarding body image.\nInterviews and focus groups were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim, omitting any names or other individual identifiers. A random 10% section of each transcript was reviewed against the audio recording for accuracy. The facilitator and principal investigator used an iterative approach to develop a codebook (a list of short phrases with clear definitions and examples from the transcripts) until a final codebook was agreed upon. The principal investigator then used this codebook to assign codes to all data. A fine-grained, editing style was used to assign codes. 47 This involves examining small phrases of text within the transcript and assigning a code that summarizes the theme or idea communicated within that text. The text can then be reorganized, if necessary, so that BODY IMAGE AND SEXUALITY AMONG MIDLIFE WOMEN its meaning can be more clearly seen. 48 Because themes were similar in interviews and focus groups, the same codebook was used for both. The primary investigator coded all interviews and focus groups, and the facilitator coded a randomly selected 25% of interviews to compare with the principal investigator. Overall kappa was 0.84, indicating excellent intercoder agreement. Women also completed brief demographic questionnaires, which were linked to transcripts using an anonymous identifier. Atlas.ti software (Atlas.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used to assist with coding. Using a thematic analysis approach, all codes regarding body image were examined, and key themes and representative quotes were identified.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Demographics", "text": "We conducted 19 individual interviews and 3 focus groups of 5-7 women each (total N = 39) (Table 1).

A 56-year-old White woman said, ''Most important with my sex life, probably number one would be feeling like my husband wants me, that he desires me.'' A 48-year-old White woman indicated, ''[E]verybody wants to feel needed. Everybody wants to feel desired. Everybody wants to know their partner is all about them. You need to feel that. If you can't feel pretty, if you can't feel happy, I mean, there's something missing, you know?'' Women discussed how feeling desired was especially important in the context of a long-term relationship. They wanted confirmation that their partner was still physically attracted to them, even if they had been together for years. A 55-year-old White woman said, ''[Having sex] validates that he wants to stay in the marriage, that he still feels attracted to me.'' Some women also emphasized that feeling attractive was not only an important outcome of sex, but also a prerequisite for sex. Some women needed to feel ''sexy'' to initiate, be receptive to, or enjoy sexual activity.\n[I]f I go to the gym and start eating better, if I feel better about myself, I'm more sexual and I feel more desire. Very hard to feel any of that when I feel like huge and fat . just bleh, out of shape, really big, I feel very unattractive. And it doesn't matter how many times he tells me otherwise. If I don't feel it, I'm just not as much fun in bed. (47-year-old Asian American woman)\nIn contrast, there were several women who mentioned how feeling attractive had become a less important reason for sex as they got older. When they were younger, they were more likely to have sex to feel ''validated''-to feel that they were sexy and attractive-but that this was no longer a major sexual motivator.\nInterviewer: You mentioned when you were younger the orgasm being more of a driving force.\nA 58-year-old White woman: That, and feeling sexy and attractive and all that other stuff, it was almost like part of your identity. Like having someone say that you were sexy was kind of what you were going after. I don't go after looking sexy anymore . I'm satisfied with what I do, who I am, and having sex or being sexy isn't a part of that.\nOther women agreed that, as they got older, they felt more self-confident and did not need as much external validation. Women also discussed how, particularly in the context of a long-term relationship, feeling attractive became less important to their sexual satisfaction as time went by.\nInterviewer: And do concerns about your looks or your body affect your sexual satisfaction at all? A 53-year-old White woman: You know what? Yes, but I've managed to kind of put those things on the back burner and not let them bother me . [I]n the early times of our relationship, I was a bit self-conscious about my weight . I don't think that physical attractiveness is necessarily the most important thing in a relationship.

Dissatisfaction with body weight was particularly common. Some women reported they had been overweight for some time, whereas others reported gaining weight during the menopause transition. Most expressed a strong desire to lose weight. Many women emphasized that the weight bothered them more than their partners, particularly for the women who were in long-term relationships. Women stated that their partners would reassure them that they still found them attractive.\nA 56-year-old White woman: You know, that's one thing: he's never made me feel like-there's times where my weight has been up. And when he married me, I was like 110 pounds. I was big tits, little waist, I was tiny. And as I had kids, gained weight . And he has never ever-and he's even said . ''Oh honey, it's just more to hold on to,'' that type of comment. He's never made me like, ''You are undesirable because of how you look.'' [H]e's never made me feel that way.\nInterviewer: And have you ever felt that way just from your .\nRespondent: Myself? . Yeah. I think most women do. I mean, I don't want the lights on. I don't want you to see my cellulite . or my thighs or that my boobs are sagging . you kind of want to leave a lot of that to their imagination .\nWhile many women were critical of their own weight, they also felt it was important for a person to accept his or her partner regardless of weight gain or other changes in appearance. A 55-year-old Black woman said, ''If you really care about someone, you accept them how they are, because even though I might be 50 pounds heavier, I'm still [name], there's just a little more of me . I'm still the same person.'' These women emphasized that love ought to be unconditional, and not depend on physical appearance.\nWomen also discussed changes in the breasts, such as sagging or stretch marks, which affected their sex lives. Some traced these changes to the time of menopause, whereas others attributed it to getting older.\nA 56-year-old White woman: Once you get over menopause, your breasts change. They are not as perky, firm, and when you lay down, [laughter] you try to get them to conform the way they're supposed to. And honest to God, and my husband always, he says ''It doesn't matter,'' but it does matter! It bothers me tremendously that that also has changed. [laughs] A 46-year-old White woman: I don't think I've gone .\nthrough menopause yet, but . I've always been big busted. And so gravity, took over a long time ago.\nSimilar to weight gain, this woman indicates her breast changes bother her more than they do her partner. Two women also mentioned medical procedures that had changed the appearance and sensitivity of their breasts.\nI have had a bilateral preventive mastectomy . And I had reconstructive surgery and I have implants but they aren't exactly the same. So . It's kind of in the back of my mind . one's kind of higher than the other. And if I move a certain way . they kind of dimple or indent. And there's no sensation. If I'm naked they look a little bit different. Now my husband doesn't care . but it's just not the same.

A 48-year-old White woman: Oh hell yes . You know, I'm not 20 years old anymore . there's some days where you really feel your age . I feel chubbier than I used to be or . I'm not as flexible as I used to be . there are days that I feel like insecure about myself . I think that's just part of being a woman in general.\nA 56-year-old White woman: And then you're doing something and then all of a sudden your back hurts or your neck's hurting and you can't . some of it's flexibility and some of it's just that you feel so old. And that does have an effect.\nA 55-year-old White woman: Sometimes-you're saying, ''I feel so old.'' And I say, I look so old . Because I remember when I was younger . I know he doesn't look the way he looked when he was younger but still in my mind, I think there I am on top of you and I'm like hanging on to you . [laughter] and my chin, my cheeks, everything. I mean, seriously though, that sometimes will stick with me.\nWomen who were self-conscious about their bodies described feeling more restricted and less ''free'' in the bedroom. They also discussed a desire to ''cover up'' by keeping the lights dim or off during sex, or wearing clothing or underwear that was less revealing. Thoughts about their body distracted them when they were participating in sexual activity. Interviewer: And has there been anything that has changed around that as you've aged?\nWoman: Hell yeah. [laughs] There's all this. I have more boobs now but it's because I'm fat everywhere. Yeah, I'd like to get rid of my crappy insecurities that I have grown up with . I wish I could just be a normal woman that could be naked in front of my own husband after 34 years and not feel self-conscious .\nOf note, she indicates that her bodily insecurities are not new with midlife. Many women echoed this.\nThere was a smaller subset of women who did not have any insecurity and felt confident and attractive. One woman said, ''You know, I'm 53, I take good care of myself, and so I generally feel attractive and [partner's name] helps me feel attractive.'' For many women, even in the face of weight gain or other bodily changes, they felt increased self-acceptance as they got older.\nA 57-year-old Black woman: [F]or me [sex] really, really is intense . [A]fter [my] hysterectomy, I became extremely uninhibited . Every time it gets better. I think as you get older, for me, it was more of a comfort level. Just being more comfortable with yourself.\nA 46-year-old White woman: Yeah, I would have to agree with her . now as I'm getting older in age, sex for me is more intense .\nA 57-year-old White woman: I think for me, the physical feeling is probably less intense than when I was young, but the emotional piece of it is much better. I can feel more playful, I BODY IMAGE AND SEXUALITY AMONG MIDLIFE WOMEN can be less inhibited, I'm more comfortable with my body. I'm able to express myself better and accept his expression better. So even physically, although it's not fantastic as it was, there's other pieces that compensate to make it better. I'd rather be here than there. These women attribute their higher sexual satisfaction with aging to higher self-acceptance and self-confidence. Some women noted that they had always been heavy but had always felt confident in their bodies. Other women discussed that only recently were they able to accept their heavier bodies and feel confident.\nInterviewer: [D]o concerns about your looks or your body affect your sexual satisfaction?\nA 48-year-old Black woman: Used to, it used to. Not anymore, [laughs] not anymore. I'm comfortable with my chunkiness, [laughs] and my partner, he's OK, with it, and he's gotten used to . so I'm comfortable now, but back in the day, I wasn't really comfortable .\n[laughs] I'm more comfortable with my body now than I was as a teenager.\nFor some women, finding a supportive partner was key to feeling sexually attractive. In addition, a few women indicated that they had successfully lost weight, and that their sexual function had improved as a result. Weight loss made certain sexual positions easier, energy levels higher, and gave them increased confidence. A 55-year-old White woman said, ''I've lost about 20 pounds in the last month . So it makes me feel better . we have better sex because I've lost weight . [Extra weight] gets in the way sometimes. But he has noticed that I don't have this heaviness here anymore, you can feel my hipbone. And he'll say to me, 'I like to grab you by your hips,' so it makes me feel better .''\nWhite women in this study were more likely to report feeling self-conscious, whereas Black women were more likely to report feeling confident. Several of the Black women discussed how their partners made them feel accepted regardless of their size or appearance. In contrast, several White women discussed how they felt self-conscious, even if their partners were reassuring. Overall, both White and Black women reported that their partners were typically reassuring to them with regard to their appearance, but Black women seemed more likely to accept this reassurance than White women. When asked if feeling attractive was a reason for sex, one 47-year-old Black woman said: Not really. I know my husband will take me as-is, regardless of me being attractive to him .\nInterviewer: Do concerns about your looks or your body affect your sexual satisfaction at all? Respondent: No, not really. My husband could care less .\n[laughs] I know with my husband, it [weight] doesn't make a difference.\nIn contrast, a 53-year-old White woman expressed: Sometimes there will be a woman walking down the street . and they're pretty and they're built like a brick house and he'll look at them . And I do catch myself saying to him, ''I don't see you looking at me like that.'' . He'll always say to me, ''I'll love you no matter what.'' . And I guess I get jealous, I don't like him looking at other women and it makes me feel like I'm a big fat thing, like you're not looking at me like you look at them. .

Women who felt insecure and self-conscious about their bodies noted these concerns had a negative impact on their sexual satisfaction, whereas women who felt confident and attractive discussed better sexual satisfaction, even in the face of bodily changes. The latter group typically noted their self-acceptance had increased with age. Black women were more likely to discuss feeling confident and attractive than White women.\nFeeling attractive was an important aspect of sexual activity for women in our study, similar to a prior qualitative study, 9 but feelings of self-consciousness and insecurity were common among the women in our study, especially concerns about being overweight. Many felt that bodily dissatisfaction was a universal experience for women. Indeed, prior studies have shown that body dissatisfaction and negative body image are common among women across the lifespan. [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] However, as mentioned in the introduction, the importance of personal appearance to women decreases with age, 21,22 similar to the reports of some women in our study. Our findings, and prior findings, suggest that while women may continue to have negative thoughts about their bodies as they get older, they tend to worry about it less. 13,21,23 Women in the present study who were self-conscious about their bodies reported that it negatively affected their sexual satisfaction. They felt more restricted during sexual activity, and discussed wanting to have the lights low or wanting to be more covered up. Prior studies, mostly among college-aged women, have similarly suggested body dissatisfaction is associated with worse sexual function, particularly in the domains of desire and arousal. 42,46,[49][50][51] Grogan explains that many women feel that their sexual relationships suffer because they are self-conscious about their bodies, despite reassurances from their partners as to their attractiveness. 16 The women in our study discussed a similar phenomenon of self-consciousness and distraction during sex. The women in the present study often reported persistent insecurities about their bodies despite reassurances from partners as to their attractiveness. Prior research has shown that women believe that men prefer a much thinner ''ideal'' than men actually do, 24,52 which may explain the difficulty women have in accepting their partners' reassurances.\nA smaller but still considerable proportion of women in our study denied bodily insecurity, reporting they felt attractive and confident. Some women felt more confident at midlife than when they were younger. This confidence translated into better sexual function. Support and reassurance from a partner was often a key part of boosting selfimage and thereby sexual function in these women, which has been reported in other studies. 50 It seems that reassurances from partners regarding the women's attractiveness were common; some women were able to accept these reassurances, and their positive body image was buoyed by them, while others wondered if their partners were just being kind, or indicated that they still felt unattractive despite partner reassurance.\nBlack women in the present study were more likely to discuss feeling self-confident than White women. As this study was not designed to make racial/ethnic comparisons, conclusions should be regarded with caution. However, these findings are consistent with prior work. 15,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] In our study, this self-confidence often resulted in overall better sexual satisfaction. These findings should be further explored and confirmed in future qualitative and quantitative research, particularly among midlife women.\nOverall, these findings suggest that self-confidence and self-acceptance are key ingredients to a satisfying sex life with aging. Healthcare providers should support a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise, while also supporting self-acceptance and positive body image among midlife women. Promoting positive body image could be an important component of behavioral interventions for midlife women with sexual dysfunction. 53,54 This study has limitations. As is typical in qualitative research, sample sizes are smaller to allow a greater depth of data, and results are not considered widely generalizable. Future studies could benefit from utilizing a mixed-methods approach, which employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses. We only included women who were sexually active in the prior 12 months, as we were interested in current sexual experiences. There may be women who are not sexually active at all due to poor body image. Given the sample size, our ability to examine racial and ethnic differences was limited; our findings should be further examined in larger, ethnically diverse samples. Some of the women in the study discussed body image spontaneously, others in response to a probing question regarding body image (see interview guide in Supplementary Data).\nOur study has significant strengths. The qualitative approach allowed women to speak their own words about their experiences at length. In addition, we had women from a variety of races and ethnicities represented. Our use of both focus groups and interviews allowed us to capitalize on the group synergy that can occur in groups of peers, while also allowing us to speak with women who may not be comfortable discussing sexuality in a group setting.", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this qualitative study of midlife women, we found that body image and feelings of attractiveness are of key importance to women's sexual satisfaction.

This study examined associations between exposure to ACEs and mental and behavioral health during pregnancy overall and among women with high versus low levels of resilience. Materials and Methods: Women in two Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical centers were screened for ACEs and resilience during prenatal care (*14-23 weeks of gestation; N = 355). Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations between ACEs and prenatal mental and behavioral health conditions overall and for women with low (\u00a332) versus high (>32) resilience on the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results: Overall, 54% of women reported 0 ACEs, 28% 1-2 ACEs, and 18% 3+ ACEs. Relative to women with 0 ACEs, those with 1-2 ACEs had higher odds of an anxiety or depressive disorder and intimate partner violence (IPV) (odds ratios [ORs] 2.42-3.12, p < 0.05), and those with 3+ ACEs had higher odds of an anxiety or depressive disorder, depression symptoms, and IPV (ORs 3.08-4.71, p < 0.05). In stratified analyses by high (56%) and low (44%) resilience, having one or more ACEs (vs. 0 ACEs) was only associated with worse mental and behavioral health in women with low resilience. Conclusions: ACEs predicted mental and behavioral health conditions among pregnant women, and associations were the strongest among women with low levels of current resilience. Longitudinal research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms underlying these associations.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A dverse childhood experiences (ACEs), defined as physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, neglect, parental loss, or family dysfunction before the age of 18, are common, 1 with approximately two-thirds of adults in the United States experiencing at least one form of ACE. 2 There is a strong dose-response relationship between exposure to ACEs and poor health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, substance use, sexually transmitted diseases, suicide attempts, and a range of chronic diseases. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] These health risks are compounded by continued stressful experiences such as intimate partner violence (IPV) in adulthood. [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Less studied but of great interest is the potential impact of ACEs on maternal health outcomes during pregnancy. A small but growing body of literature suggests that ACEs are associated with increased mental health risks during pregnancy, including higher depressive symptoms, [18][19][20][21] anxiety, 22,23 suicidality, 24,25 and substance use. 20,[26][27][28] In addition, a history of ACE exposure is associated with higher rates of psychosocial difficulties 29 and IPV in pregnancy, 20,[30][31][32] which contribute to poor mental health outcomes. ACE-related mental and behavioral health conditions are associated with both adverse pregnancy outcomes and poorer child health, [33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44] making it critically important to understand and reduce the risk of developing these conditions.\nAlthough the literature on the health impacts of ACEs is robust, studies have generally omitted protective and positive factors, such as resilience, even though evidence suggests that they can influence the impact of ACEs on an individual. 45 Resilience reflects one's adaptive ability to cope with adversity, bounce back after hardship, handle unpleasant feelings, and adapt to change, 46,47 Resilience may modify the impact of ACE exposure by encouraging the use of healthy, rather than maladaptive, coping strategies, promoting self-esteem, and from internal capabilities or environmental resources. 48,49 Researchers have recently called for the inclusion of strength-based questions in studies of ACEs to better understand whether and how protective factors reduce the negative impact of ACEs on health and functioning. 45 To address this gap in knowledge, several recent studies have investigated the potential protective role of resilience in adulthood on mental and behavioral health outcomes. [50][51][52][53] The majority of these studies have found evidence consistent with a buffering effect of resilience on the association between ACEs and psychological distress, 54,55 depression, 50,51,56 emotion dysregulation, 52 and substance use. 57 However, one study found that although resilience moderated the association between adult trauma exposure and depression, it did not moderate the association between ACEs and depression. 53 To our knowledge, only one study to date has examined whether the relationship between ACEs and mental and behavioral health during pregnancy or the postpartum period varies with resilience. Sexton et al. found that resilience moderated associations between ACEs and postpartum major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in a sample of 214 mothers, such that risk for these conditions was the highest among women who had a combination of both ACEs and low resilience. 58 Given the deleterious consequences of mental and behavioral health conditions during pregnancy on mothers and their babies, it is critical to examine whether resilience buffers the negative impacts of ACEs on prenatal mental and behavioral health.\nIn this study, we examined the hypothesis that ACEs would be associated with mental and behavioral health conditions during pregnancy, including anxiety, depression, substance use, and exposure to IPV. In addition, we conducted stratified analyses for pregnant women with high versus low levels of resilience to test the hypothesis that associations between ACEs and mental and behavioral health conditions would be stronger for women with low versus high levels of resilience. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how ACEs and resilience combine to influence a range of mental and behavioral health outcomes during pregnancy.", "n_publication_ref": 66, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study site", "text": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) is a nonprofit, integrated healthcare delivery system that insures >40% of the Northern California region's commercially insured population and provides health services to >4 million members. 59 KPNC has >40,000 pregnancies each year across 15 medical centers. KPNC patients are diverse and generally representative of the northern California population. 60 From March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, KPNC implemented a pilot program to screen English-speaking women aged \u202118 for ACEs and resilience at their second or third prenatal visit (between 16 and 23 weeks gestation) as part of standard prenatal care in two KPNC medical centers. All patients who met the criteria described earlier were included in the study.\nPatients completed the ACEs and resilience questionnaires in the exam room. Clinicians reviewed the questionnaires with patients and provided resources, including an educational handout with relevant classes, support groups, books, videos and community resources, and referrals as needed. Additional details on study materials and methods have been previously published. 61 Participants Three-hundred fifty-five English-speaking women completed the ACEs and resilience questionnaires during the 4month study period.

The modified version was developed for easier self-administration in a healthcare setting and to be appropriate for prenatal patients. Questions are presented in Table 1. Response options were yes or no; possible ACE scores ranged from 0 to 8. Given that ACEs are highly interrelated, 63 and the cumulative impact may be stronger than the impact of individual ACEs, we categorized ACEs into three categories for this study (0, 1-2, 3+) as done in our prior work with prenatal patients. 61 For stratified analyses by resilience, we combined 1-2 and 3+ ACEs and examined 0 versus 1+ ACEs to increase power for analyses among the smaller stratified populations. Studies suggest that exposure to one or more ACEs increases health risk, suggesting this stratification is clinically relevant. 64,65 We also ran stratified analyses by resilience with 0-1 ACEs versus 2+ ACEs and the pattern of results was similar (not shown). The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) is a widely used, validated, self-reported measure of core aspects of past-month psychological resilience (e.g., ability to bounce back after hardship, handle unpleasant or painful feelings, ability to adapt to change, see the humorous side of problems) that has been used in prior research with prenatal and postpartum patients. 61,66 Answer options range from ''not at all true'' (0) to ''true nearly all the time'' (4), with higher scores indicating higher resilience, and total scores ranging from 0 to 40. 58,67 We utilized the CD-RISC 10 in this study and dichotomized resilience based on the national average (low \u00a332 and high >32). 66 Diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders diagnosed during pregnancy were extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) by using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 or ICD-10 codes (Supplementary Table S1).\nDepression symptoms were based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 68 which is given during pregnancy as part of standard prenatal care (<5 none, 5-9 mild depression, 10+ moderate/severe depression). Scores range from 0 to 27 and were dichotomized into no depression (<5) versus mild, moderate, or severe depression ( \u20215) to include subclinical levels of depression symptoms and supplement data on depressive disorder diagnoses. Of the 355 women in this study, 63 women (17.7%) were missing a PHQ-9 score. Missing a PHQ-9 score was not significantly associated with ACEs or any demographic characteristics.\nExposure to IPV was based on either (i) an ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis of IPV within 1 year of the ACEs screening (Supplementary Table S1) or (ii) self-reported exposure to IPV as part of routine prenatal screening. Women with an IPV diagnosis during pregnancy (which could include a history of IPV) or endorsement of IPV during routine screening in prenatal care were coded as positive for IPV.\nKPNC pregnant women are routinely screened for prenatal alcohol and marijuana use as standard part of entry to prenatal care, via both self-report on a prenatal substance use screening questionnaire and toxicology testing (typically between 6 and 13 weeks gestation). Prenatal alcohol and marijuana use were defined as self-reported use of any amount alcohol or marijuana since pregnancy or a positive toxicology test for alcohol or cannabis as part of standard prenatal substance use screening.\nSmoking status is routinely asked about and documented in the EHR for all pregnant patients. We obtained patient-reported smoking status (i.e., current, former, or never-smoker) from the EHR at the time of the ACEs screening. 69 Prior studies support the validity of EHR-based smoking status data.

Demographic and mental and behavioral health conditions were calculated for the sample overall and by ACE category. Chisquare tests were used to examine whether demographic and mental and behavioral health variables differed by ACE category. A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test whether age differed by ACE category. Multivariable logistic regression models were run to calculate the odds of mental and behavioral health conditions during pregnancy by ACE category, adjusting for age, race, and median neighborhood income. For multivariable analyses, we combined individual types of prenatal substance use into an overall substance use variable.\nNext, we calculated the prevalence of mental and behavioral health conditions by ACE category separately for women with low and high levels of resilience.

Third, ACEs were not associated with use of cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana during pregnancy in multivariable models, regardless of resilience.\nResults from this study lend support to a small but growing body of literature suggesting that ACEs are associated with greater mental and behavioral health problems during pregnancy, including psychosocial difficulties, 29 depressive symptoms, [18][19][20][21] anxiety, 22,23 and risk for IPV. 20,30,31 Findings indicate that relative to women with 0 ACEs, women with 1-2 ACEs had between 2.4-and 3.1-fold increased odds of having an anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, or IPV during pregnancy; whereas women with 3+ ACEs had between 3.1-and 4.7-fold greater odds of having an anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, depressive symptoms, or IPV during pregnancy. Interestingly, the strongest association was between ACEs and adult IPV. This novel finding in this prenatal population is consistent with the literature suggesting that victimization in childhood increases risk for experiencing IPV in adulthood. 12,15,16 The exact mediating and moderating relationships between ACEs, IPV, and mental health remain to be established. 11 These results fit well with a larger body of literature surrounding the biological mechanisms underlying the connection between ACE exposure and mental and behavioral health outcomes. 73 Prolonged stress exposure, particularly during the neurodevelopmentally vulnerable period of infancy through early childhood, can reprogram the physiological stress response system through epigenetic reprogramming 74 and is associated with volumetric differences in stresssensitive brain regions. 75 ACE exposure is associated with molecular markers of aging and disease risk, such as telomere shortening and mitochondrial DNA copy number increases. 73,76,77 These results suggest that such molecular mechanisms may impact women in the prenatal period as well, which is particularly important given the potential for intergenerational transmission of ACEs through these biological mechanisms. 78 A particularly important contribution of this article is the finding that during pregnancy, resilience, or the adaptive ability to cope with adversity, 46 may mitigate the negative impact of ACEs on mental and behavioral health. For example, among women with high resilience, the prevalence of an anxiety disorder was similar among those with 0 (6%) and 1+ ACE (8%). However, anxiety disorders were about three times more prevalent in women with 1+ ACEs compared with women with 0 ACEs in the low resilience group (26% vs. 9%). Similar increased prevalence was found for depressive disorders, depression symptoms, and IPV for women with 1+ ACEs compared with women with 0 ACEs in the low resilience group. Although these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that resilience may moderate the impact of childhood adversity exposure, underscoring the importance of taking resilience into account when screening for adversity, we are unable to determine the direction of these associations due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. It is also possible, for example, that mental and behavioral health problems during the prenatal period contribute to lower levels of resilience.\nIn contrast to prior studies that have found greater risk of prenatal substance use among women with ACEs, 20,[26][27][28] ACEs were not significantly associated with substance use upon entry to prenatal care in multivariable models regardless of resilience. Our measures of prenatal marijuana and alcohol Depressive symptoms are based on the PHQ-9 survey routinely given during the first trimester of prenatal care. IPV includes a diagnosis of IPV in the EHR in the year before or during pregnancy or endorsing any of the three questions related to IPV at the beginning of prenatal care. Low resilience is based on a score below the national average (\u00a332), and high resilience is based on a score greater than or equal to the national average (>32) on the Connor-Davidson RISC-10 Resilience questionnaire given at the time of ACEs screening.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN PREGNANCY 457", "text": "use were based on screening at *8 weeks gestation, and due to the nature of our screening, we are unable to distinguish prenatal substance use before versus after women knew they were pregnant and we could not tell whether women continued to use substances throughout pregnancy. We were also not able to determine the heaviness of substance use in pregnancy, and the lack of significant association may be due to these factors. Future studies with larger samples that include more refined measures of substance use in pregnancy (e.g., quantity, frequency, trimester of use) are needed to better understand the association of ACEs with prenatal substance use.\nMitigating the effects of ACEs on mental and behavioral health will require developing and testing interventions that foster resilience in pregnancy. Interventions such as resilience training, which includes emotional regulation training, cognitive and behavioral approaches to reframe thoughts and refocus on positive emotion, improving physical health through sleep, exercise, nutrition and relaxation, social support, and mindfulness, hold promise toward building resilience. [79][80][81] Researchers have highlighted the need for services matched to key moderators, such as resilience, 82 that are responsive to intervention. [83][84][85] Trauma-informed treatment approaches exist and data on their efficacy are growing. 86 For example, psychoeducational programs designed to meet pregnancy-specific needs of women with ACEs exposure may help to improve mental and behavioral health. 87 Further research is needed regarding the optimal content and timing of such programs.\nHealthcare organizations have the opportunity to empower prenatal patients to cultivate their strengths and build on existing resources. This study demonstrates that ACEs and resilience screening during standard prenatal care can help clinicians identify women at risk of mental and behavioral health problems, including IPV, who may need extra support or services during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Women's health clinicians and prenatal patients should be educated about the relevance of ACEs and resilience to patients' health in pregnancy. Models integrating substance use treatment, mental health services, parenting education, family support, and other services can address these needs. 88 Incorporating ACEs and resilience screening as part of standard prenatal care is feasible and generally acceptable to patients and clinicians, provided that appropriate training and adequate mental and behavioral health referral resources are available. 61 Comprehensive and routine screening for ACEs, resilience, and mental and behavioral health conditions, in conjunction with interventions, resources, and treatment, is likely to have a strong return on investment when the health of both the mother and child is considered.\nAdditional longitudinal research is needed to investigate how obstetric and pediatric clinicians can promote perinatal resilience through screening, brief intervention, and broader systems-level changes, and to determine whether prenatal ACEs and resilience screening and intervention is associated with improved maternal or pediatric outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine associations between ACEs and multiple mental and behavioral health conditions during pregnancy separately for women with high and low levels of resilience. KPNC's integrated health-care delivery system and robust EHR allowed us to examine associations between self-reported exposure to ACEs and resilience assessed as part of standard prenatal care and mental and behavioral health conditions and IPV in an ethnically diverse population of pregnant women. However, several limitations should be noted. This study took place in two KPNC medical centers and was limited to English-speaking adult patients screened for ACEs at their second or third prenatal visit (at *14-23 weeks gestation), and results may not generalize to non-English-speaking patients, those without healthcare, and those who enter prenatal care late. Future research is needed to examine associations between ACEs, resilience, and mental and behavioral health conditions in non-English-speaking women and adolescent patients. Twelve percent of women chose not to complete the ACEs questionnaire and, although those women were similar on demographic characteristics to women who completed the screening, our study did not assess reasons for non-completion. Our measures of ACEs, resilience, and certain mental and behavioral health outcomes were based on self-report and are subject to selfreport biases; however, it is noteworthy that past research indicates good test-retest reliability for ACEs. 9 In addition, our ACEs questions did not assess ACEs severity, frequency, age or duration of exposure, or neglect, and all ACEs were considered equal (e.g., physical abuse was equivalent to losing a parent through divorce). We used the term ''sexual abuse'' in our ACEs screening, but future research should avoid emotionladen terms such as ''abuse,'' which may lead to underreporting, 89 and should instead use descriptive questions. In addition, due to sample size limitations, we dichotomized ACEs (0 vs. 1+) and resilience (high vs. low) in stratified analyses, which may have muted our findings. Additional studies with larger sample sizes that include more detailed information about a broader range of ACEs and more nuanced categorization of resilience are needed to better understand how childhood experiences and resilience impact mental and behavioral health. Finally, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design, we are unable to determine causality between resilience and maternal mental and behavioral health.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The prenatal period has been identified as a unique window of opportunity for clinicians to impact a family's long-term health by identifying women with ACEs and providing appropriate resources. 25,61 Pregnant women have increased contact with the healthcare system and are often motivated to live healthier lifestyles to improve the health of their developing child. This study adds novel data to the literature on protective factors related to maternal mental and behavioral health during pregnancy, indicating that although ACEs are important risk factors for poorer maternal mental and behavioral health in pregnancy, resilience may help mitigate this risk. Longitudinal cohort studies with larger samples will allow for greater understanding of the causal mechanisms through which ACEs and resilience combine to influence maternal behavioral health.

Cross-sectional studies demonstrate that women are often underrepresented in key leadership roles. We sought to examine the proportion of women in cardiology leadership positions and to compare the findings with the differences prevalent in the overall cardiology faculty. Furthermore, we aspired to compare the proportion of women in leadership positions to the proportion in which they entered the cardiology field. Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study of Cardiology fellowship programs identified by American Medical Association's Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (AMA FREIDA), conducted from March to April 2017. Data of all (n = 512) cardiology fellowship program directors as well as 69% (n = 140) cardiology division chiefs were collected. Results: A lower percentage of women held the role of division chief (5% vs. 95%) and program director (14% vs. 86%). However, when compared to the proportion of women in the 1992 fellowship cohort, women were significantly overrepresented in the role of program directors, with no significant difference in representation at the level of division chief. When compared to the overall cardiology faculty, program directors had significantly more publications and were more likely to have an academic rank of full professor (40% vs. 28%) or associate professor (37% vs. 23%). Male program directors had a significantly higher number of research publications, H-index, and academic rank than their female counterparts; however, such difference was not seen at the level of division chief.

However, this gender gap has decreased over the past few decades, as the number of female applicants to medical schools reached an all-time high of 51% in 2003-2004. 1 Similar progress toward gender equality has been noted in residency and fellowship workforces. 2 Even though there has been a more pronounced notion of gender parity in medical school applicants, admissions, spe-cialized residents, and fellows, 1,2 this parity is poorly reflected in the proportion of female academic faculty-which is only 38%. 1 Among all the academic ranks within full-time faculty, the only rank in which the number of women was disproportionately higher than men was in the lowest of the ranksthe instructor level. 1 The above cited percentage (38%) saw considerable differences in leadership roles with only 21% of full professors, 16% of medical deans, and 15% of all departmental chairs being women. 1 Female physician faculty are also promoted more slowly than male faculty. 3 Analysis of individual specialties reveals that gender difference exists in most key leadership roles. [4][5][6] The recent study of Blumenthal et al. demonstrated that men dominate academic cardiology faculty (84% males, 17% females), and were significantly more likely to be full professors (31% vs. 16%). 7 To our knowledge, there are no studies focusing on gender discrepancies within academic cardiology leadership positions. Therefore, we sought to examine the gender difference in academic cardiology leadership positions, and to compare the consequent trends with the differences prevalent in the overall cardiology faculty. Furthermore, we sought to compare the proportion of female academic cardiology leaders to the proportion of female cardiology fellows in a historical cohort. This is necessary considering that Hofler et al. showed that, although gender difference exists in most leadership positions, in some specialties such as anesthesiology and pediatrics, women are actually overrepresented in leadership positions when compared to the proportions in which they entered the specialty. 8 ", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data extraction", "text": "For this study, data from the four ACGME accredited cardiology fellowship programs (cardiovascular diseases [CVDs], advanced heart failure, cardiac electrophysiology, and interventional cardiology) were extracted from the American Medical Association's Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (AMA FREIDA). 9 A list of 512 programs in the United States was identified.

Similar differences have been reported in program director positions in other specialties and subspecialties such as surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, pathology, and gastroenteroloy. 6,8 Our results were not surprising, considering the gender inequality seen in FIG. 3 the overall cardiology faculty. The reasons for such stark underrepresentation of women cannot be determined from this study, but may include the following: asymmetric home and childcare responsibilities between men and women, a dearth of effective female mentorship and role models, lack of institutional support, unconscious sex bias, or lack of interest in the field. 7 On comparing gender inequality across the nine census regions of the United States, we observed that all regions had significant gender difference. The New England, Mid-Atlantic, and East South-Central regions were comparatively more likely to employ female program directors compared to other regions. This information may be valuable to female cardiologists looking for employments and aspiring for leadership positions in their career.\nIn addition to general cardiology, where 16% of all program directors were women, a similar male dominance was found among advanced cardiology fellowships of ''interventional cardiology'' and ''cardiac electrophysiology'' leadership, while the difference in ''advanced heart failure and transplant'' programs was considerably less. Interventional cardiology is notorious for its demanding on-call schedule, leading to a severely disrupted work-life balance. 11 This may represent a hindrance for women, who generally bear greater home and childcare responsibilities. 12,13 Our observations concur with the previously published literature that individuals who contribute to the medical literature are more likely to receive academic recognition/ promotion. 14 When compared to the overall cardiology cohort, program directors had a significantly higher number of publications. The same observation was made when data on men and women were analyzed separately. This suggests that the number of publications is an important criterion in the selection of program directors. Furthermore, the percentage of professors and associate professors was higher among program directors than in the overall cardiology faculty. A corresponding pattern was noted when males and females were analyzed independently. This suggests that academic rank is another important factor in the selection of program directors, although we cannot exclude the possibility that appointment to a leadership position such as program director or division chief leads to an academic promotion.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Qualifications of male versus female program directors", "text": "One would expect that at the level of program directorship, qualifications would be similar across both sexes.

For an accurate portrayal of female representation at the program director level, we compared the ratio of female directors in 2017 to the ratio of female fellows in 1992 to calculate the ''representation ratio,'' which was found to be 1.45 (95% CI: 1.13-1.86, p = 0.0033). This reveals that female program directors are actually significantly overrepresented when compared to this historical cohort. Thus, although female cardiologists are fewer in number than men, they have a higher probability of advancing to program director status. Another study found significant overrepresentation of females in four other specialties (Fig. 3). 8 Furthermore, cardiology has the highest female representation ratio at the program director level, after general surgery.\nThe reason why females in cardiology have a higher probability of being appointed program directors despite lower qualifications than males is unknown. Possible explanations for this finding include that a larger percentage of women enter academics compared to men [15][16][17] ; therefore, a larger fraction of men in the original historical cohort might have opted to enter private practice after their training. It is also well known that women are guided more toward education-oriented career paths [18][19][20] and program directorship is one of the leading clinical-educator career tracks. Moreover, the inclusion of women into academic leadership positions might be due to implementation of institutional policies intended to promote women in the field of cardiology. Several studies have concluded that women in medicine, and particularly in cardiology, struggle to find effective mentors. 21,22 Appointing women as program directors is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge and increase female role models for the next generation.

Our results also show that the distribution of female fellows was the same across male and female CVD program directors-indicating lack of bias toward either gender during fellow selection.

It can be hypothesized that greater difference among division chiefs than program directors is present because women are guided toward clinician-educator tracks, 19,20 and this track may not have the same opportunity to advance into a major departmental leadership role as the traditional research-based track. 19,24,25 Division chiefs had significantly higher number of publications and citations and higher H-index when compared to program directors. Moreover, the percentage of professors was much greater among division chiefs compared with program directors (85.2% vs. 40.4%). Hence, it may be concluded that these academic achievements are important criteria in the appointment of division chiefs. Female faculty generally have lower research credentials, 7,18 and this may explain the difference seen in this position. A recent study of leadership positions in gastroenterology found that there existed a positive correlation between female division chiefs and female program directors. 6 The findings of our study showed no such association, suggesting that women in senior leadership roles do not preferentially promote other women. Furthermore, a female representation ratio of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.24-1.06) suggested no significant underrepresentation; the representation of women as division chiefs is proportionate to their representation in the historical cohort.

Results: Overall, 10.3% of women and 5.2% of men reported using some type of meditation in the past year ( p < 0.001). Among meditators, a higher percentage of women used meditation with yoga, tai chi, or qi gong, but men were more likely to use specific types of stand-alone practices (e.g., mindfulness) than women ( p < 0.001 for each type). The most common reason reported for using meditation was to reduce stress (35%). Although women and men reported similar reasons for meditating, there were gender differences in the prevalence of some reasons. Both men and women perceived meditation to be helpful (90% and 94%, respectively). Conclusions: There are gender differences in prevalence, purpose, and perceived benefits of using meditation. US adults aged \u202118 use meditation and find it helpful. Although currently less prevalent among men, providers can consider meditation as a tool for health promotion in both men and women.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I ncreasingly, Americans are including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as meditation, as part of a wellness lifestyle. [1][2][3] In 2012, 8.0% of adult Americans used some type of meditation, and it is the fifth most common type of CAM. 4 There is growing evidence that meditation provides health benefits for clinical and nonclinical populations. [5][6][7][8] Several meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical trials demonstrate that meditation can help manage psychoemotional symptoms such as stress, anxiety, and depression, [5][6][7][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] and reduce physical symptoms such as pain, 14,15 including chronic back pain. 16,17 Concomitantly, the prevalence of stress-related, lifestyle diseases and chronic pain is growing. [18][19][20] Although recent descriptive studies provide new information on meditation use generally, 21,22 less is known about gender differences in the characteristics of meditators, types of practices, reasons for use, or perceived benefits.\nThe purpose of this study is to fill this gap in the literature by examining meditation use separately for women and men. This information, in conjunction with knowledge of efficacy and effectiveness studies, can aid healthcare providers' health promotion efforts in counseling patients with health conditions for which meditation might be helpful, either alone or in combination with standard care.\nGender differences in CAM use are well established, with women reporting higher rates than men. 4,23 In 2012, 37.4% of women reported using CAM compared with 28.8% of men. 4 Meditation is a mind-body therapy (MBT); earlier studies on MBT more generally found that women have higher rates of use than men. [24][25][26][27] Studies using more recent data that included details about specific meditation practices (e.g., mindfulness) also found that women engaged in these practices more so than men. 21,22 Some have proposed that this may be because women are more health conscious or have greater health literacy than men. 3,21 Many people are using mediation for stress management. 21,22 Women consistently report higher levels of stress than men 28,29 ; yet to our knowledge, studies have not comprehensively investigated gender-specific meditation use.\nThis study sought to comprehensively investigate the current state of meditation use by women and men in the United States. Using a modification of the Andersen behavioral model of healthcare utilization developed for CAM use, 3,30,31 we examined the contributions of predisposing, enabling, and need factors, and healthy behaviors on recent meditation use. We also estimated the prevalence of specific meditation practices and examined gender differences. Last, among meditators, we explored reasons for use and self-reported helpfulness separately by gender. We hypothesized that there would be gender differences in the prevalence of meditation, the types used, and in the reasons and perceived benefits of engaging in meditation based on the arguments elaborated above.", "n_publication_ref": 45, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods and Materials", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design and population", "text": "Data came from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an ongoing, in-person household survey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. 32 NHIS uses a multistage probability sample design with clustering, stratification, and oversampling.

Individuals who reported using stand-alone meditation in the past 12 months were asked to give the most important reason for meditating from a list of 18 possible items (e.g., to cope with health problems, reduce stress, general wellness and disease prevention). Then, they were asked how much they thought meditation helped with that issue (a great deal, some, only a little, and not at all).

Mental distress was ascertained using the K6, which is a measure of nonspecific psychological distress. The K6 was developed for use as population screening tool in the NHIS. 33 Six questions, each on a scale of 0-4, ask respondents how often they experienced symptoms of psychological distress (i.e., felt sad, nervous, hopeless, restless, worthless, or that everything was an effort) in the past 30 days. Responses were summed to create an overall K6 score ranging from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more serious distress. 33 Levels of psychological distress were classified using cutpoints identified as optimal for predicting mood disorders (0-5 for no psychological distress, 6-12 for moderate psychological distress, and 13-24 for severe psychological distress). 34 Functional limitation was classified as limited in any way versus not limited. Personal health practices were measured as a count of the number of healthy behaviors: healthy weight (body mass index 18.5-24.90), nonsmoker (current nonsmoker, vs. any current smoking), healthy alcohol use (none, light, moderate vs. heavy drinker), and sufficient leisure-time physical activity (150 minutes per week vs. fewer or no minutes of activity).

The odds of use for each covariate were similar, although not identical, for women and men. Compared with the 18-29 year olds, the women and men \u202165 had significantly lower odds of use. The effects of race and ethnicity differed by gender. Compared with White women, Black, Asian, and Hispanic women had lower odds and Other/ multirace women had higher odds of meditating. For men, only Hispanic men had lower odds than Whites. Married women and men had lower odds of use, while those with high school, some college, or college degree had higher odds than those with less than high school. Relative to women <200% FPL, those who were \u2021400% FPL had higher odds; there were no significant differences for men. Regional variation in use was similar but not identical for women and men.\nCompared with those with no mental distress, women and men with moderate or severe mental distress had higher odds of meditating, as did women and men with any type of functional limitation. Last, compared with women who reported no healthy behaviors, those with three or more had higher odds of meditating; there was no significant variation in odds of meditating based on health behaviors among men.\nOverall, 4.1% of adults in the general population engaged in stand-alone meditation practices, and 7.9% used meditation either as stand-alone practice or in combination with YTQ (top panel, Table 3). There were significant gender differences in prevalence of each type of meditation practice, with women uniformly reporting higher use than men ( p < 0.001 for each). For example, 2.1% of women reported engaging in mindfulness meditation (vs. 1.7% of men) and 4.9% of women used some type of stand-alone meditation compared with 3.2% of men. Overall, 10.3% of women reported use of any type of meditation (including in combination with YTQ) compared with 5.2% of men.\nThe lower panel shows the distributions of the individual types of meditation practices used by gender, among medi-tators.

Male meditators reported higher use of mantra, mindfulness, and spiritual meditation, whereas female meditators reported higher use of meditation   with YTQ. The majority of meditators (68.6%), regardless of gender, engaged in a single type of meditation practice. Table 4 shows the reasons for meditating and for each reason, the perceived benefit of meditation, overall, and separately by gender among those who used a stand-alone practice. The top reason mentioned was stress reduction (35% of meditators), followed by general wellness/disease prevention (24%), to feel better emotionally (11%), and to improve overall health (9%). Other reasons were less common. In general, the rank order for the reasons specified was the same for women and men. Overall, both women and men believed that meditation was helpful. For example, among those who mentioned they used meditation for stress reduction, 50% believed it helped ''a great deal'' and another 40% said it helped at least ''some.'' For each reason given, there were no significant gender differences in perceived benefits, except for two.\nAmong those who mentioned use for general wellness, a higher percentage of men reported meditation helped ''a little or not at all'' than women (15% vs. 3%). Although a higher percentage of men mentioned use for improved energy or performance (11% vs. 5%), a higher percentage of men said it helped ''a little or not at all'' compared with women (21% vs. 1%). When all reasons mentioned are combined to obtain an overall level of perceived benefit, there were significant gender differences, with men reporting higher percentage that meditation helped ''a little or not at all'' relative to women.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Our study shows that there are gender differences in prevalence, purpose, and perceived benefits of using meditation for specific reasons. Women and men use a variety of meditation techniques as stand-alone practices and in combination with other CAM modalities. In 2012, 10.3% or 12.2 million women and 5.2% or 5.7 million men used some form of meditation in the past year and for every type of specific meditation practice, women had higher rates of use than do men. While both women and men report using meditation primarily for stress reduction and general wellness and disease prevention, overall, men believe that it was less helpful. Taken together, these findings suggest that millions of women and men in the United States view meditation playing a role in helping them develop skills to better care for their own wellbeing and overall health, although somewhat less so for men.\nIn this research, we examined the contributions of predisposing, enabling, and need factors, and lifestyle behaviors on mediation use by women and men in the United States. Our findings support the utility of framing meditation with a modification of the Andersen behavioral model that was developed specifically for CAM use. 3 Also, we find that individuals engaging in meditation are similar to CAM users more generally, again supporting the use of the modified model. 1,4 Although there are substantial gender differences in prevalence of use, the factors associated with meditating are largely similar for women and men. That is, meditators are more likely to be younger, unmarried, have higher levels of education, mental distress, and functional limitations. [25][26][27] However, there are three important gender differences in factors associated with meditation. There is more racial and ethnic variability in who meditates for women than for men, such that Black, Asian, and Hispanic women are less likely and women of other races more likely than Whites. Only Hispanic men are less likely to meditate than White men. Also, women at the highest income level or who engaged in two or more healthy behaviors are more likely to meditate; this is not true for men. Other research shows that individuals who engage in healthy behaviors are more likely to use CAM for health and well-being than for treating health conditions. 3 It may be that women are more inclined than men to incorporate meditation as part of a ''wellness lifestyle,'' and may have greater health literacy relative to men. [1][2][3]21 However, health promotion efforts incorporating meditation could be targeted toward men as well as women to increase the use of this potentially beneficial practice by both.\nWomen and men with moderate or severe mental distress in the past 30 days are more likely to report that they meditated in the past year than those without distress, which may be one of the motivations for meditating. This is further supported by the finding that 60% of women and 55% of men who meditate mention stress reduction or to feel better emotionally as their reasons for using meditation, underscoring the importance of a mental health component associated with meditation. Clinical studies on meditation, but in particular, mindfulness meditation, show that it can be effective in reducing anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress compared with treatment as usual, including cognitive behavioral therapy. [6][7][8][9][11][12][13] While our findings are suggestive, it must be noted that the NHIS uses the K6 scale that has good psychometric properties for screening nonspecific psychological distress, 33 but it is not a clinical diagnostic assessment. Additional research is needed in nonclinical populations to more comprehensively investigate how individuals with mental distress use meditation; for instance, if it is used in conjunction with conventional mental healthcare, or whether it was recommended by a mental health professional or other healthcare provider.\nBoth women and men reporting functional limitations are more likely than those with no limitations to meditate. The results are in line with meta-analyses of clinical studies demonstrating benefits of meditation for physical functioning, including pain management, 6,7,14,15 and recent randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) on lower back pain and meditation. 16,17 However, only 5% of women and men meditators report that the main reason for using it was to cope with health problems. This disconnect suggests that healthcare providers have an opportunity to educate about meditation as one method that may help patients cope with physical ailments, including functional limitations.\nWe also examined gender differences in the use of specific meditation practices, and found that while higher percentages of women use each type more so than men, both genders engage in a variety of different types. For both women and men, the most common is meditation done in conjunction with YTQ. However, among meditators, women are more likely than men to engage in meditation with YTQ, while men are more likely to use each type of stand-alone practice. Women report significantly greater mental distress and more functional limitations than men, which may account for some of the differences. Other research shows that women report higher levels of stress than men, and that men and women have very different ways of managing that stress. 28,29 Better understanding of the factors driving these gender differences in meditation is needed, and it underscores the importance of providers to work with their patients to develop stress management strategies that consider gender. For example, our findings suggest that female patients may prefer a meditation practice with YTQ.\nFinally, among meditators, we explored reasons for use and level of self-reported helpfulness by gender. Although women and men report similar reasons for meditating, there are gender differences in the prevalence of some reasons. The most common reason was to reduce stress. Recent studies have also reported stress management. 21,22 Yet to our knowledge, this is the first study to document gender-specific reasons for using meditation. Both men and women perceived meditation to be helpful overall, but women are more likely than men to report mediation helped a great deal for every reason mentioned. No previous studies have investigated this. Perceptions of helpfulness may be related to gender differences in expectations for results of using meditation, or there may be gender differences in the frequency of practice.\nAdditional research is needed to better understand how Americans access and use these meditation training programs, especially with respect to the associated social and demographic differentials. As American consumers increasingly request CAM and integrative healthcare (coordinated access and use of conventional medicine and CAM) to manage their health needs, more research that explicitly characterizes meditation training programs, classes, and methods for payment through health insurance benefits is warranted. 36 In addition, while there is growing literature on the cost effectiveness of specific CAM modalities, 37 new studies emphasizing meditation are needed.\nAlthough this study used the most recent national data on CAM and meditation, making the findings generalizable to US adults, there are limitations. The cross-sectional observational design limits causal inference, especially with respect to timing of mental and health conditions and use of meditation. Because this is an observational study, meditators were selfselected and undoubtedly differ on other characteristics not included in our analysis. In addition, there is no information on the frequency or duration of meditation practice. Last, while suggestive, the meditation reasons and outcomes assessed were subjective. These issues are important considerations when outcomes and benefits are being evaluated.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Meditation is practiced by *18 million women and men in the United States, and the majority report health and wellness benefits.

It is the second most common cancer in pregnancy worldwide, second to only cervical cancer. Between 0.2% and 2.5% of all breast cancers associated with pregnancy, and one in five breast cancers diagnosed in women aged 25-29 are PABCs. [1][2][3] The mortality of PABC is not higher when matched for age and stage to patients with breast cancer not associated with pregnancy (non-PABC). 4 However, one study reported 40% mortality among patients with advanced PABC who received chemotherapy when studied over a 13-year period (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004). 5 ", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Diagnosis of PABC", "text": "The evaluation of breast symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period can be challenging due to the hormonally induced changes in breast tissue that may lead to increased firmness and nodularity. Furthermore, the symptoms of postpartum lactational mastitis mimic locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer. The majority of PABCs are diagnosed after presenting with a palpable mass. However, skin thickening and skin redness can be present up to a quarter of the time. 3,6 Completing a reliable diagnostic workup with imaging to determine the extent of disease is important in treatment decision-making. In a nonpregnant patient, breast imaging can include ultrasound, mammogram, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound helps discern between cystic and solid masses, and mammography can reveal calcifications that may not be visible by ultrasound alone. 7 Ultrasound is widely used in pregnancy and the safety has been previously established. 8 Mammography confers minimal dose to the fetus with abdominal shielding (0.001-0.01 mGy with two views), far below the minimum threshold of 200 mGy for adverse effects during organogenesis (up to 10 weeks of gestation). 9 Although contrast-enhanced breast MRI can be a useful diagnostic tool in non-PABC, the safety of gadolinium in pregnancy is controversial. Free gadolinium is considered toxic and therefore only administered to humans in chelated form. It crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid to be swallowed by the fetus and re-enters the fetal circulation. Furthermore, the prone positioning necessary for breast MRI may lead to prolonged pressure on the gravid uterus, disrupting uterine blood flow. Although lactating women are encouraged to pump or breastfeed immediately before MRI to reduce the background enhancement, gadolinium is excreted into breast milk at a rate of 0.0004% of the maternal dose, and therefore, the American College of Radiology guidelines do not require that patients discontinue breastfeeding after contrast-enhanced MRI. 10 In some advanced PABC cases where metastases are suspected, a metastatic workup before delivery may be necessary to guide treatment decisions. Given that lungs, bone, and liver are the most common metastatic sites of breast cancer, a pregnant patient may undergo a chest X-ray with abdominal shielding, liver ultrasound, and noncontrast supine MRI in place of the bone scan to complete the metastatic workup. The fetal dose of PET/CT has been found to be 10-50 mGy and therefore is usually deferred to the postpartum period. 9 See Figure 1 for a diagnosis and treatment algorithm of PABC.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Treatment of PABC", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Initiation of local versus systemic therapy in PABC", "text": "Depending on the clinical scenario, PABC patients and their providers may be confronted with the choice to either proceed with local control or to initiate systemic treatment.\nFor patients diagnosed with early-stage PABC, both breast conservation and mastectomy are considered viable surgical options. However, diagnosis in the first or second trimester may influence the decision to proceed with mastectomy to avoid a potential delay in administration of post-lumpectomy external beam radiation, which is contraindicated during pregnancy. See Table 1 for treatment options of PABC by gestational age.\nWith regard to specific risks of any surgery during pregnancy, the second trimester is considered by many practitioners to be the safest time for surgery, with the lowest risk of miscarriage and preterm labor. However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has advised that nonobstetrical surgery during the first trimester is routinely performed and considered to be low risk to the mother and fetus, and none of the contemporary anesthetic agents has been shown to have teratogenic effects when used in standard doses at any gestational age. 11 Therefore, surgery during the first or second trimesters would be appropriate.

If intraoperative fetal monitoring is used after 24 weeks, a qualified individual should be available to interpret the fetal heart rate pattern and an obstetric care provider with cesarean delivery privileges should be readily available.

Although the 5-HT3 antagonist was reportedly correlated to an increased risk of cleft palate in a retrospective epidemiological study, more recent higher quality data have demonstrated that having a history of hyperemesis gravidarum, not the exposure to ondansetron, may be associated with an increased risk of birth defects. 41,42 Metoclopramide (Pregnancy Category B) is commonly used to treat hyperemesis in pregnancy and helps improve gastric motility. 43,44 Steroids are often given along with other antiemetic drugs prophylactically before the administration of chemotherapy.

Before initiating therapy, gestational age and normal anatomy should be confirmed. Chemotherapy should be discontinued at 35-37 weeks or 2 weeks before a planned delivery to reduce the risk of maternal or neonatal cytopenia. 2 Similar to patients without cancer, if iatrogenic preterm delivery before 37 weeks is anticipated, then antenatal corticosteroids should be administered 48 hours before delivery to improve fetal lung maturity. 50 With regard to mode of delivery, vaginal delivery is preferred over cesarean section due to the shorter recovery period. The placenta should be sent to pathology after delivery to rule out the rare event of placental metastases. 51,52 Prognosis of PABC Historically, breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, particularly if diagnosed in the first trimester, has been an impetus to recommend termination of the pregnancy to mitigate the potential tumorigenic effects of the pregnancyinduced hormonal milieu and to allow for initiation of treatment. In a study of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the first trimester, there was not a difference in oncologic outcome between those women who terminated and those who did not. 53 The decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal choice of the well-informed patient, but she may benefit from a discussion regarding the treatment options specific to her tumor and the optimal timing of surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy.\nMost data on the prognosis of patients with PABC are based on small cohorts and are limited by the retrospective nature and heterogeneous treatment regimens. However, in a study of more than 300 women with PABC matched to more than 800 nonpregnant controls with breast cancer, poor prognostic factors of high-grade and hormone receptornegative tumors were more common in those diagnosed during or after pregnancy. However, disease-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different when the patients were matched for age, stage, and tumor characteristics. Therefore, although pregnancy itself was once considered an independent risk factor for worse outcome, the prognosis of these patients is not significantly different than nonpregnant counterparts of a similar age. 1 Diagnoses in the postpartum period, however, may portend a worse prognosis. In a retrospective cohort study of 619 women younger than 46 years diagnosed with breast cancer between 1981 and 2011, cases diagnosed within 5 years postpartum had an almost three times greater risk of distant recurrence and death than nulliparous women, even with adjustments for biologic subtype, stage, and year of diagnosis.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Future Pregnancies and Genetic Testing", "text": "Women with a history of PABC should not be discouraged from future pregnancy.

It is three times more common in women than in men, with a lifetime prevalence of 43% and 18%, respectively. 1 Globally, >14% of the adult population has migraine, resulting in migraine ranking as the second leading cause of global burden of disability. [1][2][3][4] During childhood, migraine is slightly more prevalent in boys than in girls, with boys on average presenting at a slightly earlier age (Fig. 1). However, after the onset of puberty, migraine becomes more prevalent in women than in men and remains as such for the majority of the lifespan. 5,6 Migraine reaches peak prevalence at 30-39 years of age, during which time a quarter to a third of people with migraine will have at least four attacks per month. 3 The peaks of migraine prevalence in women are bimodal, reaching the highest rates at ages 25 (-8.6) and 50 (-15.8) years. By this measure, at the average age of 30.2 years, women experience migraine at a rate of 2.9 times higher than men. 2,5 Migraine has wide-ranging adverse effects on physical, emotional, and social aspects of daily living, 7,8 and can be disabling and costly for patients, employers, and society as a whole. 9 The total costs of migraine are estimated to be $78 billion per year in the United States. 9 Most of these costs are indirect, with lost productivity (presenteeism and absenteeism) playing a large role. 10 Migraine is broken down into two categories based on the frequency of attacks: episodic migraine and chronic migraine. Episodic migraine involves <15 headache days per month, and chronic migraine is 15 or more headache days per month, 8 days of which are migraine attacks, for at least 3 months in succession. 11 Those with chronic migraine constitute 6% of the migraine population, and two-thirds of individuals with migraine experience three or fewer headache days per month on average. 12 Per person, the economic burden of migraine in the United States is estimated to be $2649 for individuals with episodic migraine and $8243 for individuals with chronic migraine. 10 Compared with men, women with migraine shoulder a great deal of the economic burden, accounting for *80% of direct medical costs and 80% of total lost labor costs. 13 With such high prevalence rates and economic costs, migraine is an immense burden on families, healthcare professionals, and society. 14 Sex and gender play critical roles in the risk, pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of migraine. Throughout this review, sex refers to the classification of living things according to reproductive organs and functions assigned by chromosomal complement, and gender refers to the social, cultural, and environmental influences on the biology of women or men. 15 Despite clear differences in migraine between women and men, more attention in this area is needed. By examining sex and gender differences in migraine and addressing knowledge gaps, the large health and economic burden of this disease can be lessened for both sexes.\nTo this end, the Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR \u00d2 ) convened an interdisciplinary expert panel of researchers, clinicians, and advocates for a roundtable meeting (Table 1). Meeting objectives were to (1) review the current state of the science in sex and gender differences in migraine, (2) identify knowledge gaps in the field, and (3) highlight areas of need that warrant further attention. This review summarizes discussions from the roundtable and prioritizes areas for further exploration.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Biological Mechanisms", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Hormones", "text": "It is believed that female sex hormones play a large role in the development of migraine and are likely contributors to observed sex and gender differences in this disease. This can be seen as the rate of migraine prevalence correlates with periods of large hormonal changes throughout the lifespan. 5 Changes in migraine prevalence resulting from fluctuations in hormones disproportionately affect women due to the cyclical nature of their hormonal cycles. For example, variations in age of first menarche show a relationship with migraine prevalence. A longitudinal study following young women revealed that earlier age of menarche predicted increased odds of developing migraine, with those who underwent menarche by age 11 years having a 7% increased likelihood of developing migraine than those who reached menarche at age 12 years and later. 16 FIG. 1. Lifetime prevalence of migraine by sex. Migraine is more prevalent in boys than in girls during early childhood. After the onset of puberty and for the remainder of the lifespan, migraine is more prevalent in women than in men, with bimodal peaks of prevalence at 25 (-8.6)  Researchers now understand that small shifts during specific hormonal phases may be the key to identifying differences among those who experience migraine. Interestingly, recent work that measured hormonal changes throughout the menstrual cycle suggested that women with migraine have a faster drop in estrogen levels during the late luteal phase, irrespective of when during the menstrual cycle migraine attacks occurred. 17 Based on these findings, a current hypothesis relates estrogen withdrawal as a hormonal trigger in women with migraine. However, this concept needs additional work to fully elucidate the role of estrogen in migraine. There is also a lack of large longitudinal studies capturing both hormonal and migraine data. More studies are needed to increase understanding of hormonal influences on migraine not only during the monthly menstrual cycle but also throughout a woman's lifespan.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Mouse models", "text": "Mouse models can be useful tools in understanding mechanisms underlying pain and pathways believed to be involved in migraine attacks. Owing to the confounding effect of the female hormonal cycle on many study outcomes, the field has traditionally used male mice as models, greatly limiting our understanding about potential sex differences in pain processing.\nCharacterization of migraine in animal models has resulted in multiple phenotypes reflective of disturbances in brain and vascular function. Mouse models of cortical spreading depolarization, the electrophysiological event underlying migraine, are used to explore the role of hormones in migraine because of the model's sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations. In a study that compared female and male FHM1 mutant mice, which carry a human mutation causing migraine, female mice were more likely to experience cortical spreading depolarization than male mice. 18 Furthermore, neurological deficits secondary to cortical spreading depolarization that clinically resemble migraine aura symptoms persisted for a longer period of time in female mice than in male mice. This increased susceptibility in female mice could be normalized by ovariectomy. In contrast, orchiectomy increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization in male FHM1 mutant mice, which could be prevented by testosterone replacement. 19 Reflecting the clinical improvement of migraine in postmenopausal women, increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization normalized with advanced age in female FHM1 mutant mice. 18 Together, these results strongly suggest that female gonadal hormones increase the susceptibility to migraine via an estrogen-dependent electrophysiological effect, whereas testosterone suppresses it.\nFurther exploration of sex differences and different stages of the female hormonal cycle across various migraine mouse models will broaden our understanding of the role of sex hormones. For many women, fluctuations in estrogen, either throughout menses or over their lifetime, can worsen migraine and may play a role in other migraine symptoms typically experienced by women.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Neuroimaging", "text": "Neuroimaging provides insights into structural, chemical, and functional characteristics of migraine. It allows assessment of areas in evoked or resting brain activation during and between migraine attacks and can be used to understand the mechanisms of the disease. Although neuroimaging studies have revealed multiple abnormalities in brain regions in association with migraine, [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] there is a limited, yet growing, number of studies on sex differences in neuroimaging and migraine, which represents an area needing more research.\nRecent studies suggest that the brains of women and men may be affected differently in association with migraine. Structural brain differences between women and men with migraine have been seen in the insula and precuneus. 28 Of note, the left posterior insula was thicker in women with migraine than in men with migraine and controls. The insula is involved in pain processing, interoception, 29 autonomic function, 30,31 and sensation. 32,33 Women with migraine also showed greater activation than men with migraine in brain regions involved in emotional processing. 28 Taken together, these sex-specific differences suggest a possible mechanism for higher subjective ratings of headache unpleasantness experienced by women with migraine. 28 Furthermore, functional networks are derived from correlations between time courses of brain activity in different regions and may reveal differences between organized and disorganized brain processes. Functional brain networks in women with migraine showed decreased network robustness and nodal centrality and more dysfunctional connections than men with migraine, which may reflect impaired communication within and between brain regions in women. 34 In contrast to basic science studies, the majority of neuroimaging studies in migraine include mostly female subjects. To gain a strong understanding of sex differences in disease, there is a need to study more men with migraine in neuroimaging. Further exploring the role of sex differences in the brain in those with migraine and continuing to broaden the understanding of migraine etiology may lead to new avenues for therapeutic intervention.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Risk factors", "text": "Environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors can also increase risk for migraine. Sex differences may also play a role in cases wherein episodic migraine transforms to chronic migraine. Individuals with transformed migraine have reported higher rates of depression, anxiety, and headacherelated nausea, [35][36][37] which are all more common in women than in men. This suggests that women may have an increased likelihood in transitioning from episodic to chronic migraine, although more research in this area needs to be done. [38][39][40] Social and environmental factors also play an important role in the disease. Victims of intimate partner violence and adverse childhood experiences are associated with increased risk for migraine.

Conceptualized differences in migraine are defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICHD-3) and list criteria for menstrually related, pure menstrual, and nonmenstrual migraine. 11 Menstrual migraine is defined as migraine attacks occurring in at least two of three menstrual cycles, extending from 2 days before onset of menses through 3 days after onset. Compared with nonmenstrual migraine, menstrual migraine is associated with more disability and the attacks are more severe, more resistant to treatment, and longer lasting. 46,47 This includes worsened prodromal features such as irritability, fatigue, and nausea. 40 Lost work productivity is also greater in those who experience menstrually related migraine than those who do not. 48 ", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Comorbidities", "text": "Comorbid conditions are very common in individuals with migraine, particularly those with chronic migraine. Comorbidities can reveal what system is affected and help better understand which treatment may be most fitting.

[51][52][53][54] Relationships between comorbidities are not well understood, which is particularly problematic as comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, and obesity are associated with increased frequency of migraine attacks and are risk factors in the transition from episodic to chronic migraine. 35,36,[55][56][57] More research is needed to better understand these differences and the role they play in migraine etiology and treatment.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Treatment", "text": "Until earlier this year, the FDA had not approved a new drug specifically designed for the prevention of migraine since methysergide in 1962, despite efforts from researchers and clinicians to get new interventions to market. Furthermore, identifying sex differences in migraine treatment is largely overlooked. Often, during study design and data analysis, sex differences in efficacy of treatments are not considered. One study comparing the efficacy of three different triptans showed no statistical differences between women and men. 58 However, it is known that some pharmacological interventions react differently in women and men, [59][60][61] and thus it is critical to consider sex in trial design and analysis. Unlike in basic science research, wherein male animals are heavily favored, clinical trial populations are representative of the migraine population in terms of gender, with women represented -two to three times more than men. More work is needed, however, in diversifying studies re-garding race/ethnicity. Although recent headache studies meet NIH requirements for minority inclusion, minorities remain underrepresented in trials compared with the population of those with migraine, creating difficulties in researchers' ability to investigate race-based differences in migraine etiology and treatment. 62 All current headache therapies are Class B or C, meaning that there is a lack of human research regarding whether migraine treatments are safe during pregnancy and lactation. [63][64][65][66] Triptans, the most common abortive pharmacological treatment option for migraine, are currently not recommended during pregnancy, although preliminary research has indicated they are safe. 67,68 Owing to widespread use of opioids for pain treatment, a greater amount of data exists regarding opioid use during pregnancy. 69,70 This can influence healthcare providers in recommending opioids over triptans for migraine treatment for women who are pregnant or lactating. In addition, biobehavioral treatments and healthy lifestyle recommendations have strong efficacy and are extremely important during pregnancy and lactation. [71][72][73] Transitioning from prescribing opioids to triptans, as well as incorporation of other available treatment options for women who are pregnant or lactating, may be safer and more effective for women with migraine, although more research is needed to ensure safety.\nHormonal fluctuations are a common trigger for the majority of women with migraine. 74 Given the role of estrogen in migraine pathophysiology, administering women estradiol during the last luteal phase of the menstrual cycle can delay the onset of migraine. 75 Of note, women with migraine have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including stroke, 47,76,77 which is important to consider when prescribing birth control for women with migraine because of the association between birth control and increased stroke risk. 78 However, these conclusions may have been based on older data rather than current low-dose estrogen contraceptives, and a recent review concluded that there has been a lack of studies assessing stroke risk in women with migraine who use lowdose estrogen contraceptives. 79 Together these findings indicate that women may benefit from further exploration of the role of hormones in migraine attacks and treatment.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Barriers to Care", "text": "Migraine accounts for more than half of all neurological disability and is the second leading cause of global burden of disability. 2 Yet, women's disproportionate role in migraine disease burden is not appropriately appreciated.

Migraine-related disability increases as the number of migraine attacks per month increases. 12 Compared with men, women are more likely to require bed rest with attacks and experience disabling attacks that last from 1 to 6 days. 44 Seeking and receiving proper care for migraine remain enormous public health problems. A minority of individuals who have episodic or chronic migraine seek consultation (45.5% episodic and 40.8% chronic) (Table 2). Only a small fraction of those with episodic or chronic migraine are properly diagnosed (39.5% episodic, 10.0% chronic) and receive evidence-based treatment (26.3% episodic, 4.5% chronic). 80,81 Women with migraine are more likely than men with the disease to have talked to a provider and received a diagnosis, whereas more men are likely to have significant disability by the time they seek care. 44 Women are more likely to be taking prescription medications, whereas men are more likely to be taking no medications at all or only over-the-counter medications. Women are also more likely than men to have sought care in an emergency setting. 44 Women face increased barriers to receiving proper diagnosis for menstrual migraine as a prevalent migraine subtype. There is a general lack of education and awareness about menstrual migraine, leading to difficulties in obtaining proper diagnosis and an absence of effective treatments. These barriers may be exacerbated by the placement of menstrual migraine in the appendix, rather than the main text of IHCD-3, thereby implying to healthcare providers that it is not of high importance. The ICHD-3 requires that to research women with menstrual migraine, diary documentation of at least three cycles is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, creating yet another barrier to diagnosis and to investigating new treatments for women with menstrual migraine. Studies of large randomized controlled trials would be highly valuable in the legitimization of a disease that many providers and patients know exist but are unable to diagnose and treat.\nOf those providing care, 85% of doctors certified in headache medicine by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS) are neurologists, 63% of whom are men. 82 More research is needed to clarify whether a healthcare provider's gender affects health outcomes for individuals seeking care for migraine; however, studies have shown differences in patient outcomes that were associated with their healthcare provider's gender. [83][84][85][86][87] For example, compared with men, women healthcare professionals across all specialties are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines, more often provide preventative care, and more often provide psychosocial counseling. [83][84][85][86]88 Interestingly, migraine has a higher prevalence among neurologists and headache specialists for both sexes (Table 3). 82 The effect of this on a provider's ability to empathize with people with migraine or develop knowledge of treatment regimens remains unknown.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Stigma", "text": "A major root cause for many of the challenges in delivering and receiving optimal migraine care is stigma toward those with the disease. Because migraine is three times more prevalent in women, some perceive it as a feminized and less legitimate disease. 89 Men with migraine may delay care due to this feminization, 44 and individuals with migraine may be less motivated than those with other diseases to seek care due to fear of not being taken seriously or not being able to receive appropriate care. 90 The accumulation of stigma has a negative impact on the lives of all individuals with migraine, but particularly women, who are often responsible for a larger amount of traditionally noncompensated labor (e.g., housework and caregiving) compared with men. The Migraine Disability Assessment Test and the Headache Impact Test 6 are the most widely implemented scales used to evaluate the impact of migraine on health-related quality-of-life issues. [91][92][93] However, with these current instruments, the disproportionate impact migraine has on women may not be well captured. For example, these questionnaires only evaluate the impact of headaches on the individual with migraine and only during attacks. Meaning, the family burden of migraine is not adequately captured as well as the burden of disease in between attacks. Individuals with migraine may have lost productivity and/or miss family or social obligations in between migraine attacks because of prodromal symptoms or anxiety about the uncertainty of their next attack. New scales have been developed to measure the impact of migraine on spouses and children, but they have yet to be widely adopted. 14,94 Despite its high prevalence, stigma also exists toward migraine research among academics. 89 Funding of NIH migraine research is the lowest relative to disease burden among the most impactful diseases. 95 This fact may discourage academic neurologists from pursuing this specialty, as it could be perceived to be difficult to secure research funding or academic positions. In addition, healthcare providers may be  reluctant to specialize in headache medicine because migraine is not taken as seriously as other neurological diseases and headache medicine might not reimburse as favorably as other neurospecialties that may rely more heavily on procedural treatments. Lack of investment in migraine research also harms treatment development. By increasing funding for migraine research, migraine may be able to move forward as a field and greatly improve patient care, including the much needed advancements in understanding sex differences.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "To address gaps in knowledge, more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the etiology, presentation, treatment, and care for those with migraine. Sex hormones play a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine, yet little is known about the role of hormones in the brain.\nIncluding both female and male animals into future study design will better reflect migraine phenotypes. Because of varying prevalence of migraine throughout the lifespan, animal models that incorporate different age groups are also necessary. Furthermore, hormonal effects vary among age groups, so sex and gender differences will need consideration throughout the lifespan. By analyzing age groups and sex in migraine research, we can gain a more robust understanding of migraine etiology, allowing basic science research to better bridge the gap between animal and human studies.\nIn addition, few studies have investigated sex differences in response to current approved interventions for migraine, as well as their use in women who may be pregnant or lactating. Deficiencies in sex and gender differences in reported treatment efficacy and side effect data must be addressed. Treatment options for specific age groups and those with a combination of comorbidities should also be explored. Gender differences in migraine need to be better understood, as measured through the gendered dimensions of violence, trauma, precarity, obesity, and education, and their role on migraine. Understanding the diverse contributors to migraine will lead to more robust treatment options.\nIn evaluating stigma, there is a need for more data describing employer and general population views on migraine, as well as research that develops social frames to improve support for people with migraine. This includes improvements in patient-reported outcomes and an increase in the number of studies investigating societal views of migraine. With this information, evidence-based initiatives addressing knowledge gaps in overcoming stigma may be designed.\nThrough evaluation of the current landscape on sex and gender differences in migraine, the expert panel at the SWHR roundtable meeting identified clear gaps in our understanding that require more research (Table 4). Better understanding how sex and gender impact the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and management of migraine can lead to improved access to care and health outcomes for both women and men. received honoraria from Teva.

Previous studies have suggested a possible link between maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and the risk of PPHN. This study aimed to provide an up-to-date review and meta-analysis of the topic. Methods: Using the search terms [SSRI OR SSRIs OR selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors OR antidepressant OR Prozac OR fluoxetine OR Lexapro OR escitalopram] AND [pregnancy OR maternal OR newborn OR persistent pulmonary hypertension OR PPHN OR neonat* OR fet*], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar database yielded 7327 articles published in English between January 1, 1960 and October 1, 2017. Results: A total of 9 cohort and case-control studies, with a total of 7,540,265 subjects were systematically reviewed. Random-effects meta-analysis of eight studies revealed a significantly increased risk of PPHN with maternal SSRI use during pregnancy, with a pooled OR of 1.516 (95% confidence interval: 1.035-1.997, p < 0.001). Overall, the absolute increase in risk of PPHN with SSRI use appears small, with an absolute risk difference of 0.619 per 1000 livebirths and a number needed to harm of 1615 women. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that there were significantly greater odds of PPHN with SSRI use during pregnancy. However, the clinical significance of this association remains modest and likely outweighed by the potential benefits of treatment of perinatal depression. The risk of PPHN associated with SSRI therapy might not warrant the recommendation to withdraw antidepressant therapy, as evidence from other studies show that untreated perinatal depression presents additional adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Given the increasing prevalence of maternal depression and consequent use of antidepressant medications, further research with robust longitudinal or randomized, controlled studies and mechanistic investigations are needed.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P ersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the failure of the newborn's respiratory system to become functional after birth. It is characterized by an abnormally high resistance in the pulmonary vasculature after birth leading to shunting of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circulation.\nPPHN is associated with significant mortality and morbidity if not sufficiently treated. Infants with PPHN could develop severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care, and about 10%-20% of cases may die. 1 It is therefore imperative to research the possible antecedents and risk factors of PPHN. Studies have elucidated that structural pulmonary vascular remodeling in vitro owing to altered production and responsiveness to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors has a role in the disease process of PPHN. 2 Animal studies have demonstrated that drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are able to cross the placenta and even accumulate in the fetal brain. 3 Theoretically, the higher circulating levels of serotonin in the fetus and fetal lung vasculature could result in vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby inducing pulmonary hypertension, which is characteristic of PPHN.\nSSRIs are increasingly used as the primary drug to treat clinical depression worldwide. In the United States, the prevalence of use of SSRI in pregnancy is estimated to be in the range of 2.5%-4%. 4 For women, the risk of depression is significant during pregnancy. 5 However, the use of SSRIs during pregnancy to treat antenatal depression remains a conundrum. Although the risk of teratogenesis associated with SSRIs is small, 6 large cohort studies concerning the use of SSRIs in pregnancy have reported an association between antenatal SSRI exposure and an increased risk of developing PPHN. 7,8 Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of maternal depression and consequent use of SSRIs, it is important to better clarify the risk of PPHN associated with the use of SSRIs in pregnancy. Owing to the varied mechanisms of actions of the different classes of antidepressants, this review will choose to focus solely on SSRIs, one of the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants during pregnancy worldwide. 9 With new studies showing null or positive associations since the last meta-analysis published in 2014, 10 the current meta-analysis aimed to provide an updated review of the subject and generate hypotheses to guide further research.  1,1960 and October 1, 2017.

The inclusion criteria for this review were: (1) published retrospective or prospective study (excluding single case reports), (2) patients with recorded use of SSRIs during pregnancy, (3) available birth outcome data, including incidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn. Data such as study design, study population and demographics, antidepressant received, and outcome measures were extracted. The primary outcome measures of interest were the likelihood of PPHN with SSRI use during pregnancy. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study before being pooled, and if available, adjusted ORs were used. 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and p-values were calculated as well.\nHeterogeneity among the different studies pooled was examined using the I 2 statistic and Cochran's Q test.

The key details of each study were extracted and summarized in Table 1. Nine studies were systematically reviewed and one 12 was excluded from the final meta-analysis as it did not adjust for potential confounders and reported only crude ORs.\nWith regard to the possibility of publication bias, visual inspection of the funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies (Fig. 2) and Egger test was not significant for publication bias ( p = 0.978). However, it must be acknowledged that Egger test is less reliable when the number of studies is small (<10).\nAs seen in Figure 3, using a random-effects model, the meta-analysis found that maternal SSRI use during pregnancy was associated with an increased likelihood of PPHN (pooled OR 1.516, 95% CI: 1.035-1.997, p < 0.001). This was statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis and additional subgroup analyses (e.g., SSRI use in early vs. late pregnancy) were not done due to the already small number of studies available, limiting the strength of any subgroup analyses.\nAs the outcome of PPHN is rare, the OR can be assumed to be approximately the same as the relative risk. 18 Using a baseline risk of 1.2 per 1000 live births 7 and the pooled OR of 1.516, the absolute risk difference associated with antenatal SSRI exposure is *0.619 per 1000 livebirths and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 1615 women.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Current evidence suggests that there were significantly greater odds of PPHN with SSRI use during pregnancy (pooled OR 1.516, 95% CI: 1.035-1.997, p < 0.001). This is concordant with the findings of an earlier meta-analysis, 10 which reported ORs of 1.23 (95% CI: 0.58-2.60) and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.32-4.73) for maternal SSRI use in early and late pregnancy, respectively. Our findings expound on the earlier meta-analysis, showing that the likelihood and absolute risk   difference of PPHN with SSRI use is probably more modest than previously thought, and the absolute risk of PPHN although statistically significant, may not be clinically significant. 19 Compared to the earlier meta-analysis, we included several new studies and also performed a more comprehensive review of study quality using the validated Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, 11 our study is therefore a significant contribution to current literature. When it comes to clinical decision making, the risks of maternal SSRI use have to be weighed against the potential benefits, as untreated maternal depression is also an independent risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes. 20  registry study found that reducing exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy had no significant clinical effect on improving neonatal health. 21 Untreated or undertreated maternal depression has been tied to complications such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and neurobehavioral problems in the offspring. 22 From a mechanistic viewpoint, animal studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are able to cross the placenta and even accumulate in the fetal brain. 3 It has been suggested that the possibility of higher circulating levels of serotonin in the fetus and fetal lung vasculature could result in vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby inducing pulmonary hypertension, which is characteristic of PPHN.\nMore recently, it has been shown in a cohort study 14 that even after controlling for possible confounding factors, SSRI exposure was still associated with an increased risk of PPHN. In view of the serious and life-threatening nature of PPHN, clinicians should be informed of antenatal SSRI exposure, heightening their vigilance for PPHN, especially if other contributory risk factors for PPHN (such as maternal diabetes and hypertension) are present. More research into other pharmacological agents and effective nonpharmacological options for the management of perinatal depression is also necessary.\nIn terms of study limitations, practically speaking, it is impossible to fully account or adjust for all potential confounders, for example, caesarean section, especially before the onset of labor, may be particularly opted for by depressed/anxious mothers. 23 Residual confounders limit the reliability of our findings. Moreover, pregnant mothers who used SSRIS tended to be older, more likely smokers, had higher body mass index, and more frequently delivered by caesarean, 15 and these are all potential risk factors for PPHN. In addition, it is important to note that the diagnostic criteria of PPHN and its definition may have differed among the reported studies, and some of the largest studies identified PPHN only through International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes obtained from medical records, [14][15][16] which are invariably subject to human errors.\nOverall, as the absolute increase in risk of PPHN with SSRI use appears small (with an absolute risk difference of 0.619 per 1000 livebirths and NNH of 1615 women), the clinical significance of this association remains modest and unclear. If a pregnant mother suffers from severe depression, refractory to nonpharmacological options, the benefits of SSRI therapy probably far outweigh the potential risks (Table 3). Furthermore, a prospective study found that FIG. 3.

PPHN, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Little to no risk of spontaneous miscarriage 31 Preterm birth (relative risk = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5-2.0) 30 Untreated maternal depression linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes 25,26 Small risk of PPHN Reduced risk of depressive relapse 24 women who discontinued antidepressant medication relapsed significantly more frequently over the course of their pregnancy compared with women who maintained their medication. 24 The risks of untreated perinatal depression include higher rates of hospitalization, increased risk of preterm birth, increased suicide ideations and attempts and impaired adherence to medical therapy and management. 25,26 While the calculated NNH implies that on average, 1615 women with singleton pregnancies need to be exposed to SSRIs over a specific period to cause harm in an average of one patient who would not otherwise be harmed. Thus, routine discontinuation of SSRIs for treatment of perinatal depression cannot be recommended. However, this stance may change as new data are constantly emerging. In fact, a recently published metaanalysis has now linked the use of SSRIs during pregnancy to an increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. 27 Further rigorous longitudinal or randomized, controlled studies and investigations into the mechanisms underlying the observed association of PPHN with maternal SSRI exposure are necessary to advance current understanding. Studies employing ''omics'' technologies might unravel new mechanistic insights concerning SSRI exposure. 28 Conclusion SSRI use during pregnancy was associated with an increased likelihood of PPHN. Random-effects meta-analysis of eight studies yielded a pooled OR of 1.516 (95% CI: 1.035-1.997, p < 0.001). However, at present, the clinical significance remains unclear as the absolute increase in risk of PPHN with SSRI use appears small, with an absolute risk difference of 0.619 per 1000 livebirths and NNH of 1615 women. Our study suggests the risk of PPHN associated with SSRI therapy might not warrant the withdrawal of antidepressants, as evidence from other studies show that untreated perinatal depression presents additional adverse outcomes. Given the increasing prevalence of maternal depression and consequent use of antidepressant medications, research into the antenatal risks associated with SSRI should be further explored. Although rare, PPHN is associated with substantial infant mortality and morbidity. Further detailed studies, including longitudinal or randomized, controlled studies and investigations into the mechanisms underlying the observed association of PPHN with maternal SSRI exposure are required to advance current understanding.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Disclaimer", "text": "The authors report no conflicts of interest.

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify and summarize factors that may be affecting PrEP implementation for women in the United States. We conducted a search of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis Project database (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and PubMed to identify peer-reviewed studies published between January 2000 and April 2018 that reported U.S. women's or health care providers' PrEP knowledge or awareness, willingness to use or prescribe, attitudes, barriers and facilitators to use or prescription, or PrEP adherence and discontinuation influences. Thirty-nine studies (26 women, 13 providers) met the eligibility criteria. In these studies, 0%-33% of women had heard of PrEP. Between 51% and 97% of women were willing to try PrEP, and 60%-92% of providers were willing to prescribe PrEP to women. Implementation barriers included access, cost, stigma, and medical distrust. Three studies addressed adherence or discontinuation. PrEP knowledge is low among women and providers. However, women and providers generally have positive views when aware of PrEP, including a willingness to use or prescribe PrEP to women.

It has garnered much enthusiasm for use in women at a high risk for HIV. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] PrEP is effective and safe for women. [10][11][12] In clinical trials, women with high adherence to PrEP were less than half as likely to acquire HIV compared with women taking placebo. 13 PrEP can be used during pregnancy and as a method to promote safer conception for serodiscordant couples. 14,15 Moreover, PrEP is a private, user-controlled method, so women do not need approval or compliance from partners to protect themselves.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a PrEP indication for Truvada in 2012. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued interim guidelines for use by heterosexuals in 2012, 16 followed by full guidelines in 2014 17 and revised clinical practice guidelines in 2017. 18 PrEP is recommended for heterosexual women who are at substantial risk of acquiring HIV. This includes women who have an HIV-positive sexual partner, and women in communities with a high prevalence of HIV who have at least one the following criteria: recent gonorrhea or syphilis, a high number of sex partners, a history of inconsistent or no condom use, or commercial sex work. PrEP is also recommended for adult persons who inject drugs and are at substantial risk of infection, including having an HIV-positive injection partner or sharing injection equipment. 18 However, despite published guidelines and endorsements from HIV and women's health experts, few women are taking PrEP. An estimated 176,670 heterosexually active women have indications for PrEP use in the United States. 19 Yet only about 238 commercially insured women were taking PrEP in 2014, meaning just 2.5% of all commercially insured PrEP users were women. 20 Given this staggering underuse of PrEP by women, it is critical to understand what factors may be influencing PrEP implementation for this population.\nWhile PrEP implementation is influenced by many determinants, our review focused on provider-and patient-level factors. We conducted a systematic review of health services and implementation-related studies of women and oral PrEP from the perspective of women and health care providers in the United States. Koechlin et al. published a systematic review of attitudes regarding PrEP implementation based on a review conducted for the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, 21 which addressed both women and health care providers.

Each search is implemented annually using the following databases: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and PsycINFO (OVID). 23 The automated search was developed in the MEDLINE (OVID) database using indexing and keyword terms cross-referenced using Boolean logic with no language limits. The finalized search was tailored to the other databases to adhere to each proprietary indexing system (Appendix A1).\nFor this systematic review, the librarian queried the PRS database using keywords and index terms related to women and care providers (Appendix A2).

In a study of family planning providers, of those identified as potential  prescribers (n = 342), only 38% could correctly define PrEP.

In women's studies quantitatively investigating willingness to use PrEP, 51%-97% or more women were open to using PrEP. 26,27,31,[41][42][43][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] This includes one study of women who were planning pregnancy, were pregnant, or had recently given birth, in which 67% (16 of 24) women who were offered PrEP decided to use it. 31 Women also reported high willingness to try PrEP in qualitative studies. 29,33 Across the women's studies, women consistently reported high willingness to use PrEP, but low prior awareness that PrEP was an option (Fig. 3).\nProvider studies generally revealed high willingness to prescribe to women. Surveys often asked about specific scenarios, rather than prescribing to women overall (e.g., women with a male sex partner with HIV, or women with multiple sex partners). However, across scenarios, 60%-92% reported willingness to prescribe to women. [44][45][46][57][58][59][60] In one provider study using surveys conducted during 2009-2015, 91% (6844 of 7515) practitioners reported willingness to prescribe PrEP; obstetricians and gynecologists (93%) were slightly more willing to prescribe PrEP compared with general/family practitioners (91%). 46 No studies explicitly asked providers if they were willing to prescribe PrEP to women desiring to conceive.

Most women were positive about PrEP, 29,33,35,38,45 believed their female friends would take PrEP, 25 and would recommend PrEP to their female friends. 29 In one qualitative study (n = 144), women reported mixed feelings about whether PrEP would improve or negatively affect their sex lives. 33 However, in a small study that included U.S. female PrEP users (n = 72), there was no evidence that PrEP affected their sexual behavior. 27 Additionally, although oral PrEP was preferred over other PrEP options (including vaginal rings, gels, and injectables) in these two studies, 27,33 one found an injectable form would also be highly desired and that women wanted a choice. 33 A majority of participants in each provider study reported positive attitudes toward PrEP. In two studies, a majority of participants believed PrEP would empower women who are unable to negotiate condom use. 62,63 Findings from another study highlighted that family planning providers wanted to receive more PrEP education, but did not believe that PrEP education, as part of HIV prevention education for patients, was essential to family planning visits. 47 This study also found that, of potential PrEP prescribers (n = 342), 75% participants were at least somewhat uncomfortable prescribing PrEP. 47 ", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Barriers and facilitators to potential PrEP use and prescription", "text": "Fourteen women's studies 25,27,29,30,33,35,38,[41][42][43]45,[49][50][51]54 and five provider studies 47,48,[64][65][66] reported potential barriers and facilitators to PrEP use or prescription (Table 2).  41 Rutledge et al., 42 Willie et al. 43 ).

Some women were concerned that PrEP would make them feel sick. 50 Others said short-term effects such as nausea were not concerning, 29,35,54 though long-term adverse effects may be. 29 Low HIV risk perception was the top reason women were not interested in PrEP in one study (n = 2721), while fear of HIV was the top reason for being open to PrEP. 51 Facilitators to PrEP use included familiarity with pills, 27 daily use, 27,29 and that PrEP is user-controlled. 35 Women also reported that recommendations from health care providers, 25 especially primary care providers, obstetricians, gynecologists, and family planning providers, 33 or other trusted sources, such as community-based organizations (CBOs) and peers, 30,33 encouraged women to use PrEP. Partners might also facilitate PrEP use. In one study of women's experience with using PrEP (n = 72), their partners were overwhelmingly supportive of their PrEP use. 27 The biggest barrier to providers was lack of information. Providers surveyed before PrEP's approval in 2012 wanted more efficacy data on women. 64 Providers also believed they needed more PrEP education in general 47 and regarding counseling pregnant women about PrEP use. 48 Other barriers to prescription included concern about the effectiveness of PrEP in real-world settings, cost to patients, providers' lack of time, as well as discrepancies between guidelines and clinical practice (before the release of 2014 guidance). 47,48,65 Provider studies largely did not report on facilitators to PrEP prescription apart from one finding that having more efficacy data would be a motivator to prescription 64 and another stating that a facilitator of PrEP for safer conception was that it was user-controlled. 66 Adherence and discontinuation influences Three women's studies 27,28,31,32 and no provider study reported on adherence and discontinuation influences outside the context of PrEP for safer conception. The MTN 001 openlabel, cross-over, phase 2 clinical trial that included 70 U.S. women examined plasma-based PrEP adherence levels by age, marital status, educational attainment, and sexual factors (multiple partners and male condom use), but did not find any statistically significant adherence associations. 28 This study also found that U.S. women most frequently reported missing a dose due to forgetting. 27 In the HPTN 069 phase 2 clinical trial, 2 of 9 women taking TDF-FTC discontinued use due to adverse events. 32 A small study of women before, during, or after pregnancy observed that the most common adherence and discontinuation influences among those who stopped using PrEP (7 of 16) were difficulties with daily pill use, social stress, pregnancy or breastfeeding initiation, side effects, and cost. 31 ", "n_publication_ref": 91, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "PrEP has the potential to be a powerful HIV prevention tool for women.

Most studies focused on knowledge, willingness to use or prescribe PrEP, or barriers and facilitators to PrEP use. Most were based on hypothetical rather than actual PrEP use or prescription, which is likely due to the small number of female PrEP users to date. 20 Despite the key role of providers in successful PrEP implementation, there were fewer studies and a narrower range of topics covered per study in provider studies compared with women's studies. Additionally, assessments often captured providers' general beliefs or practices rather than those specific to their cisgender female patients, which could differ compared with their transgender female or male patients. Further research to address gaps in our understanding of PrEP implementation for cisgender women is warranted because findings can strengthen the evidence base that informs efforts to increase women's PrEP use for as long as needed or desired.

Although it is unclear whether or to what extent these findings can be generalized to broader populations of providers and women at risk for HIV, PrEP education for women and providers is important.\nNationally representative data from providers about PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and practices specific to cisgender female patients are needed. Because PrEP is a prescription medication, providers serve as gatekeepers for its use. Providers need information about PrEP efficacy for women and effective strategies to provide PrEP-related care. Therefore, it is important to conduct studies to identify providers' specific educational needs, and to develop, evaluate, and disseminate clear and concise educational tools. Additionally, more qualitative and quantitative health communications research is needed to develop and evaluate new and existing PrEP education campaigns for women. Outcomes of interest include increased PrEP knowledge, increased self-efficacy for communicating with a partner, provider, or others about PrEP, increased self-efficacy for PrEP use, and discussing PrEP with a provider. Given the diversity within the large population of cisgender women who might be at risk for HIV infection, it is probably necessary to tailor messages to address differences in women's lived experiences based on race and ethnicity, age, or geographic location, for example.

Implementation research to identify effective, scalable models and best practices for improving women's access to PrEP and related care could be advantageous. Additionally, to improve PrEP implementation for women, valuable insight could be gained from health services research to evaluate the potential effects of educating providers about ways that bias (based on race, gender, or class, for example) can hinder interactions between patients and providers or hinder patient engagement with the broader health care system. Identifying strategies to remove barriers for women and developing a workforce equipped to provide culturally and gender-appropriate care could accelerate women's PrEP uptake.

Primary study aims: Assess current use of Pap-HPV cotesting and describe local population trends over time in Pap and Pap-HPV cotesting. Secondary aim: Assess sociodemographic factors correlating with screening. Methods: We assessed Rochester Epidemiology Project data for Pap and Pap-HPV cotesting among women age 16 years and older living in Olmsted County, Minnesota, yearly from 2005 (study population n = 47,203) through 2016 (study population n = 49,510). We calculated 3-year (Pap) and 5-year (Pap-HPV) moving prevalence rates of screening as proportion of eligible population. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors potentially associated with screening. Results: In 2016, 64.6% of 27,418 eligible 30-to 65-year-old women were up to date with cervical cancer screening; 60.8% had received Pap-HPV cotest screening. Significant declines in Pap completion rates over time were observed in all age groups, including an unexpected decline in 21-to 29-year-old women. Coincident with decreasing Pap screening rates, Pap-HPV cotesting significantly increased among women age 30-65 years, from 10.0% in 2007 to 60.8% in 2016. Conclusions: This suggests increasing adoption of 2012 screening recommendations in the 30-to 65-year-old population. However, decline in Pap screening among 21-to 29-year-old women is concerning. Disparities by race, ethnicity, smoking status, and comorbidity level were observed. Results suggest need for multilevel patient and clinician interventions to increase cervical cancer screening adherence.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I n 2018, an estimated 13,240 cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed and an estimated 4,170 cervical cancer-related deaths will occur in the United States. 1 Although Papanicolaou (Pap) screening has reduced incidence of cervical cancer and death by more than 60% since being introduced in the 1950 s, 2 underscreened and especially never-screened women continue to be at particularly high risk. [3][4][5] Multiple organizations provide recommendations for cervical cancer screening, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 6 the American Cancer Society (ACS) in conjunction with the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) and the American Society for Clinical Pathology, 7 and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). 8 Previously, concordance did not exist between the recommendations of these groups. However, with updates published in 2012, consensus has developed among the organizations, advising Pap testing every 3 years for women age 21-65 years or Paphuman papillomavirus (HPV) cotesting at 5-year intervals for women age 30-65 years. ACOG, ACS, and ASCCP have recommended Pap-HPV cotesting as the preferred screening method for women age 30-65 years.\nReported population adherence to recommended cervical cancer screening tests is generally high. Data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicate that 81.1% of women age 21-65 years report having had a Pap test within the past 3 years. 9 However, this rate is below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 93%, 10 and declines have been noted in Pap testing among women age 21-65 years between 2000 and 2015. 9 Among women 30-65 years of age, Pap-HPV cotesting has a lower false-negative rate than Pap testing alone because use of the HPV cotest reduces the likelihood of missing an abnormality. Use of HPV cotesting also may improve detection of glandular cell abnormalities compared with the use of Pap testing alone. 11 Despite these benefits, national self-reported rates of Pap-HPV cotesting are much lower than self-reported Pap test rates, with 41.0% of women age 30-39 years; 29.8%, age 40-49; and 20.3%, age 50-65 years reporting Pap-HPV cotesting within 3 years. 9 However, a recent analysis of claims data indicated an increase in rates of Pap-HPV cotesting among women age 30-65 years from 2005 to 2014. 12 The primary aims of our study were to assess current rates of Pap-HPV cotesting in Olmsted County, Minnesota, and to describe trends over time in both Pap testing and Pap-HPV cotesting in our local population in the context of the 2012 national screening recommendations.

In concordance with updated national screening recommendations and a recent analysis of claims data, 12 a significant increase in Pap-HPV cotesting was observed for women age 30-65 years from 2007 to 2016. The rate observed in our 2016 data exceeds the cotest uptake reported in the 2015 NHIS data, although underreporting likely occurred in the NHIS survey because women may not know whether an HPV test was performed along with their Pap test. 9 Rates of HPV cotesting in our population were higher than those observed in an analysis of claims data of privately insured women across the United States in 2014, the most recent comparable year of claims data reported. The women were primarily enrolled in fee-for-service plans (71.6%), with the largest percentage residing in southern states. 12 In a large academic medical center with greater racial diversity than our population, comparable increases over time in use of Pap-HPV cotesting for screening were reported for 27,035 women age 30-65 years. 18 The investigators reported Pap-HPV cotesting rates as a proportion of all screening tests performed and results were confirmed through a pathology data system, with an observed increase from 8.9% in 2006 to 78.4% in 2013.\nSignificant declines in cervical cancer screening among adolescent girls and women age 16 to almost 21 and older than 65 years from 2005 to 2016 observed in our population align with the 2012 recommendations. These recommendations are to initiate screening at age 21 years regardless of sexual history, rather than to potentially start screening earlier, and to discontinue screening in average-risk women with adequate past screening after age 65 years. However, results from a recent retrospective cross-sectional chart review of 3,920 Pap tests from women in a single metropolitan health system showed that, among women identified as screening ineligible based on 2012 recommendations, 40% of Pap tests for women older than 65 years and 51% of Pap tests in women younger than 21 years were not indicated. 19 These results illustrate the ongoing need to address overutilization of cervical cancer screening tests. An especially concerning observation in our study was the decline in Pap test screening among women age 21-29 years, for whom the test is recommended. The downward trend is consistent with 2015 NHIS data that showed a decline in self-reported historical screening in this age group, from 86.8% in 2000 to 77.6% in 2015. 9 However, the screening rates in our population were much lower, with declines in screening from 62.8% in 2005 to 47.3% in 2016; our observed trends were consistent with those reported by Watson et al. 12 in their analysis of claims data from 2005 to 2014.

In Olmsted County, Pap and Pap-HPV cotest completion was more likely among white women than among black women or Asian women. Non-Hispanic women were more likely to have had Pap-HPV cotesting than Hispanic women. These findings are consistent with past studies highlighting racial disparities in cervical cancer screening, particularly among black and Hispanic women. 20,21 In a report of 2015 NHIS data, cervical cancer screening was lowest among Asian women (75.8%). 22 Non-Hispanic women (83.5%) recounted higher overall Pap or Pap-HPV cotest completion at intervals consistent with the 2012 recommendations than Hispanic women (78.6%).\nResearch results are mixed on correlation between smoking status and cervical cancer screening compliance. Several studies have reported lower likelihood of cervical cancer screening compliance in smokers compared with nonsmokers. 23,24 However, in a cross-sectional analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, MacLaughlan et al. 25 distinguished between former, current, and never smokers in reporting cervical cancer screening rates. They found that screening compliance was highest among former smokers (86.7%) compared with never smokers (83.7%) and current smokers (81.7%; p < 0.001). In a report from the Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health, current smokers in the United States and current or former smokers in Canada were more likely to be up to date with cervical cancer screening than never smokers. 26 Comparably, in the Olmsted County population, the past or current smokers were more likely to have completed screening Pap testing and Pap-HPV cotesting than never smokers.\nGreater multimorbidity, as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, was associated with a slightly lower likelihood of screening in our study population. This finding is consistent with earlier literature showing that increased comorbidity 27 and increased severity of disability 28 are associated with less cervical cancer screening compliance. It suggests that efforts are still needed to improve screening in this vulnerable population.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study limitations and strengths", "text": "The Olmsted County population is less ethnically diverse than the U.S. population, which represents a limitation in applicability of our findings in other regions, although it reflects the demographic characteristics of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest. 29 Overcounting of persons 20-29 years of age is a recognized limitation of the REP data. 15 We expect that many of those persons are not full-time residents of the community, but are able to continue coverage under their parent's insurance through age 25 years. If they receive health care while in Olmsted County and have a local billing address, they are counted as residents of the REP community. However, if they obtain health care outside this community (e.g., reproductive health care services from student health services), this information is missed. An additional limitation of our study is that we did not assess for overscreening. We defined the rate of Pap testing as at least 1 Pap test in 3 years and the rate of Pap-HPV cotesting as at least 1 Pap-HPV cotest in 5 years. It is possible that some women had more than 1 test during those time periods.\nStrengths of the study include validated and longitudinal Pap test and Pap-HPV cotest completion data in a defined population. Past research has shown that self-reported cervical cancer screening frequency is often overestimated.

We surveyed NIH study section members in 2016 and 2017 to determine their attitudes toward the policy and their perceptions regarding its implementation. Materials and Methods: Members of standing study sections and special emphasis panels who met in May, June, or July of 2016 and 2017, and had a publicly accessible e-mail address, were invited to participate in the survey (n = 4376 and n = 4710, respectively). The survey assessed participant demographics, knowledge and awareness of the SABV policy, and opinions regarding its utility and implementation. Results: A combined total of 1161 study section members participated in the survey for a response rate of 10.2% in 2016 and 15.1% in 2017. Respondents thought it was important for NIH-funded research to consider SABV (63% vs. 68%, p = 0.141) and that it will improve rigor and reproducibility (54% vs. 58%, p = 0.208). In terms of implementation, respondents indicated that the percentage of grants, which have successfully addressed and incorporated the policy, has significantly increased over time ( p < 0.0001 for all endpoints). However, open-ended comments revealed concern for federal research funding, the overuse of experimental animals, and uncertainty surrounding grant scoring, as it relates to the SABV policy. Conclusions: In this study, we show improving attitudes toward the sex-inclusive policy at NIH and that a statistically significant number of grants are addressing sex as a biological variable appropriately in their submissions. These data suggest the policy is becoming more well accepted, and it is thus anticipated that the reproducibility of scientific reports will increase over time and new discoveries using sex as a biological variable are on the horizon.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "S ex as a biological variable has been systematically excluded from fundamental research and clinical studies [1][2][3] until two landmark injunctions by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The first of these policy changes was mandated by Congress in 1993 through the NIH Revitalization Act, which required the inclusion of females in NIH-funded clinical research. 4 After several decades of developing best practices to improve the inclusion and retention of women in clinical research, male and female participants are approaching parity. 5 However, no such policies governed the inclusion of males and females in basic science or preclinical research.\nFollowing years of advocacy, 2,6 the NIH issued a notice in 2016 requiring NIH grantees to ''consider sex as a biological variable (SABV)'' (NIH NOT-OD-15-102). 7 Unlike the federal mandate for inclusion, the more recent policy asks only for justification and/or description of sex as part of the ordinary scientific report. The anticipation is that when investigators ''consider'' sex as a biological variable, they may be more inclined to ''study'' sex in the context of signaling pathways and physiological research, and in disease settings.\nWhile commentaries both for and against the policy exist, [8][9][10][11] data surrounding its implementation are lacking. 12 In this study, we examined the attitudes of NIH study section members as a large demographic of individuals charged with the review of the policy as part of grant evaluation, and who are themselves grantees, thus providing a proxy for investigators across all disciplines of science.

The majority of respondents became aware of the SABV policy through the NIH (60% vs. 57%) and not through their home institution (13% vs. 12%, Supplementary Table S1). In 2016, the majority of respon-dents felt confident in their understanding of the SABV policy (83.5%), which increased significantly to 88.4% by 2017 ( p = 0.018, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3).\nIn both years, over 70% of respondents indicated that the NIH provided adequate educational resources regarding the SABV policy (70.8% vs. 74.5%; p = 0.165), whereas the majority reported that they were unaware of or were not provided any educational resources by their home institutions (75.2% vs. 75.6%; p = 0.886, Supplementary Table S2).

These two questions highlight a direct application and goal of the policy, respectively. A majority of respondents thought that it was important to consider SABV in the experimental design (63.4% vs. 67.6%; p = 0.141) and that considering SABV would improve rigor and reproducibility (54.0% vs. 5%; p = 0.208, Supplementary Table S3).

In both cases, there was a statis-tically significant increase in the proportion of grants that addressed the SABV policy between 2016 and 2017 ( p < 0.0001 for each endpoint).\nA majority of study section members indicated that the consideration of SABV was consistently weighed into an applicant's approach score (55% vs. 61%; p = 0.0518). In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of grants that provided consistent justification for the use of a single sex between 2016 and 2017 (44% vs. 50%; p = 0.0330).\nRespondents had the option to leave open-ended comments at the end of each survey (n = 130 in 2016 and n = 257 in 2017, Supplementary Table S5).

Following initial review, comments were categorized into one or more of the following major themes: budget, animal use, policy, research area, and grant review.\nIn the budget theme, comments highlighted the need for increased federal funding for research citing that the SABV policy places, ''[an] unreasonable demand given the limited budgets allowed for NIH grants,'' while comments pertaining to animal use indicated that the SABV policy ''requires increasing the number of experimental animals.'' Comments that addressed the implementation of the policy itself were mixed, as some lauded the policy, as ''a simple and needed criterion,'' while others were more critical citing it as, ''[a] waste of time, not at all getting to the root of reproducibility problems.'' Finally, respondents provided comments directly related to study section and the grant review process. Comments spanned multiple topics such as reviewer education (''Our review officer [redacted] was really good in explaining the new policy to us. That is how I learned about how to incorporate it into my proposals and my reviews of others proposals,''), policy implementation (''The applicants have gotten the message and now include sex as a biological variable in their proposals.''), and discussion of the policy itself (''SABV was strongly emphasized in the premeeting discussions, and it was mentioned for every discussed application.'').\nHowever, respondent comments revealed variability in the way the policy impacts grant scores citing that, ''It is difficult to determine whether the individual reviewers modified their score on Approach based on whether [sic] the criteria for sex as a biological variable,'' and ''Reviewers have different opinions on how much weight consideration of SABV should have on the score of the application.,'' While another respondent shared that, ''Consideration of SABV was not usually a score-driving consideration.''\nIn addition to our qualitative analysis, semiquantitative in silico sentiment analysis was utilized to interpret the respondents' comments. In general, the overall comment sentiment analysis scores for both years were slightly negative [median (quartile 1-quartile 3): -0.262 (-0.828-0) vs.\n-0.181 (-0.726-0); p = 0.358, Table 4]. When analyzed by theme, comments pertaining to animal use or budget/funding issues received the lowest sentiment analysis scores, followed by comments related to the SABV policy itself.\nBecause we identified biological sex and experience conducting sex-based research as two potential factors that influence views toward the SABV policy, we analyzed comments by these variables. While there were no significant differences in 2016, sentiment analysis scores significantly FIG. 2. Comparison of respondents' perception of SABV policy implementation between 2016 and 2017.

Instead, we chose to survey the attitudes and opinions of NIH study section members who serve both as policy adjudicators and representatives of the biomedical research community. The results presented in this study suggest that awareness, perceived comprehension, and implementation of the NIH SABV policy are improving over time, but that negative attitudes toward the policy persist and additional training and/or guidance may be warranted.\nOur data indicate that the SABV policy is accepted and understood by a majority, but not all, of study section members. We identified potential biases that may influence attitudes toward the SABV policy, such as field of study and sex. Researchers who currently explore the study of sex differences were significantly more likely to agree that it is important to consider SABV and that it improves rigor and reproducibility. This may indicate a potential knowledge gap for investigators who are less familiar with the role of sex in health and disease.\nAlso, sex of the study section member appears to influence attitudes toward the policy as female study section members in the 2017 cohort were significantly more likely to view the SABV policy as favorable compared to men. While women are in the minority of study section membership (44% of our respondents in 2017), they may see value of the policy at a personal level, as sex-based research is directly implicated in women's health. 6,12,15 The ability to leave open-ended comments provided study section members with the opportunity to discuss issues not directly assessed in the survey. Sentiment analysis, utilized in an attempt to remove potential author bias, revealed negative feeling toward the policy. However, open-ended responses were entirely voluntary, and it may be that those with polarized feelings toward the policy were more likely to reply. Nevertheless, these comments provide a contextual framework in which the policy can be evaluated.\nBudgetary and/or funding concerns were woven throughout many of the comments, citing that increased funds were needed to appropriately consider SABV. Also, many comments voiced concerns for animal welfare, stating that the SABV policy requires an increase in experimental animals. This is likely derived from the assumption that to consider SABV, sample sizes must be doubled and female animals at varying stages of the estrous cycle should be utilized. While estrous cycle staging may be required to conduct experiments specifically designed to explore hormonal influences on a given trait or condition, several studies reported that there is no increase in intragroup variability between males and females, regardless of estrous cycle stage, [17][18][19] thus allowing for the inclusion of both male and female subjects, without an increase in sample size (for a more detailed discussion of this topic, consult a recent review by Beery 20 ).\nIn terms of policy implementation, study section members expressed differing viewpoints as to how the SABV policy was to be evaluated and scored within the context of grant review. This highlights an opportunity for increased reviewer education, although many scientific review officers and section chairs were praised for their efforts to educate their Sex is a reasonable biological variable to require in many instances; however, it is just one. The requirement should be broadened to reasonable biological variables like sex, age, environment, etc. Why is sex being singled out as the key biological variable to be considered for review purposes? The idea of focusing on sex as a biological variable is important and necessary. However, like many regulations, the implementation of a single rule to all areas of research is difficult and may eventually undermine the utility of the rule. Negative sentiment (SA < 0)\nFor some areas of research, this is nonsense. It's not applicable and requiring it stands in the way of making progress. It seems simplistic and blunt to have a policy requiring that sex be included/considered biological variable in all NIH studies. This policy ignores the complexity of sex as a biological variable and the cost and time that would be required to adequately address this in every grant. The policy introduces a variable that cannot be adequately controlled for with typical budget and capacity constraints and weakens rigor of the majority of applications.\nmembers on the policy. Finally, it came to our attention during review of the comments that numerous individuals misused the terms sex and gender, referring to gender in a specific scientific context (i.e., cell or animal models) when sex is the appropriate term. 21 This could suggest that researchers may benefit from additional training and/or education on sex-and gender-based research practices.\nIn terms of how the policy has been accepted by grant applicants, study section members found that the number of grants that addressed SABV both in their research strategy and specifically within the experimental design, analyses, and reporting has significantly increased since the policy was introduced. Likewise, there was a significant increase in the number of grants, which provided consistent justification of the use of a single sex. These data are encouraging and demonstrate adherence to the policy. Future studies are needed to examine whether this initial outcome translates into sex-based or sex-inclusive research findings with direct impacts on health and disease.\nWhile this is the first assessment of study section members' attitudes toward the SABV policy, it is not without limitations. First, there was a limited response rate for both surveys (10% and 15% for 2016 and 2017, respectively). Study section members may have felt uncomfortable participating in a survey related directly to the NIH review process. To ensure anonymity and the confidentiality of the review process, we did not ask any questions related to specific applications or analyze data by study section membership. This study was not funded by the NIH; however, this information was not included in the consent materials, which may have deterred study section members from participating.\nIn addition, this study is not a true follow-up as study section membership differed between the two study cohorts. This limitation was mitigated by the fact that the demographics and experience of respondents were not significantly different between 2016 and 2017. It is also important to note that this study assessed respondents' perceived knowledge of the SABV policy, and not through a direct assessment of policy content. Thus, respondents who indicated that they felt confident in their understanding of the SABV policy may not actually have content knowledge surrounding the purpose and scope of the policy. Likewise, respondents were tasked with estimating the percentage of grants reviewed, which incorporated the SABV policy several months after attending study section. We acknowledge that these data, at face value, serve only as estimate and do not reflect the actual number of grants that adhere to the SABV policy. Due to confidentiality of the grant review process, it would fall under the purview of the NIH to conduct an exact analysis.\nFinally, while sentiment analysis was utilized in an attempt to remove reviewer bias of open-ended comments, implicit bias may still persist into thematic coding of the comments and the representation of such within this article. Blinded, independent review was used to mitigate this risk.\nIn conclusion, inclusion of sex as a biological variable in fundamental research funded by the NIH is a policy that is accepted by a majority of study section members. Moreover, study section members are knowledgeable about the policy with information largely obtained from NIH. Most study section members believe that the policy is improving rigor and reproducibility and a statistically significant number of grants are addressing sex as a biological variable appropri-ately in their submissions. Yet, respondent comments revealed that negative attitudes toward the policy do exist.\nAs women are only now approaching parity in clinical research, 5 25 years after the implementation of the NIH Revitalization Act, we encourage the research community to view policies that examine the influences of both sex and gender on health and disease as scientific imperative. This will help to ensure that the reproducibility of scientific reports increase over time and that new discoveries using sex as a biological variable are on the horizon.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the individuals who participated in this survey.

Materials and Methods: Multistate data were obtained from the 2014 to 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data were included from respondents who were asked whether they identified as transgender, and if so, as male-to-female (MTF), female-to-male (FTM), or gender nonconforming. Frequent mental distress ( \u202114 days in the last month of ''not good'' mental health) was the primary outcome of interest.

Within the health care system itself, providers often lack knowledge or comfort in providing care for transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Existing data suggest worse mental health outcomes in transgender compared to non-transgender cohorts, including disproportionately high rates of suicide, suicide attempts, and depression. 4,[7][8][9][10] The minority stress model hypothesis attributes these disparities to stressors induced by the dominant social environment, including harassment, discrimination, and victimizationall stressors are experienced at strikingly high levels by transgender individuals. 4,11,12 This theory has been used previously in gender and sexual minority populations to explain high rates of tobacco use as a method of coping with minority stress. 13 The minority stress model is supported by consistent evidence suggesting that mental health outcomes in the transgender population are significantly improved by engagement with social support. 7,[14][15][16] Furthermore, social transitioning and use of gender affirming medical care has also been associated with improved mental health outcomes among transgender youth and adults. 15,[17][18][19][20][21] Sociodemographic characteristics of the transgender population in the United States are different from those of the cisgender population and may, in part, explain differences in mental health outcomes. Transgender individuals are more likely to live in poverty, less likely to attend college, and less likely to identify as white, when compared with the nontransgender population. 10,22 It is unclear whether disparities in mental health outcomes can be accounted for entirely by differences in sociodemographic characteristics associated with poor mental health, including age, poverty, education, and race, or whether there are other factors related to identifying as transgender or gender nonconforming that account for discrepancies in the mental health outcomes of transgender compared with non-transgender people. 23,24 Overall population level data have consistently shown a higher incidence of frequent mental distress and depression among women compared with men, without accounting for transgender versus cisgender status. [25][26][27][28] The etiology of gendered differences in depression is unclear, with theories suggesting the potential for both biologic differences and socioenvironmental factors. 25 Systematic reviews have consistently failed to associate depression with fluctuations in sex hormones, such as in the context of menopause, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. 25,29 The transgender community is heterogeneous, both in terms of gender and other demographic characteristics. 10,22 There has been a limited assessment to date of mental health outcomes among various gender identities within the transgender community, particularly regarding people who identify as nonbinary. 10 Moreover, population level demographic and health research on the transgender community has been limited by the conflation of sex and gender in the majority of national surveys, resulting in reliance on convenience samples that may be limited in generalizability. 30,31 The results of such studies offer inconsistent evidence regarding differences in the mental health outcomes of transmasculine and transfeminine cohorts. 8,20,[32][33][34] More information is needed regarding potential differences in mental health outcomes between minority genders within the transgender community to target and track efforts to eliminate disparities and improve mental health outcomes.\nWe address these gaps in the literature by exploring selfrated mental health and depression disorder diagnosis in a multistate probability sample, allowing for a comparison of the mental health of transgender and non-transgender people, as well as between different minority genders. Based on the theoretical framework of the minority stress model and existing data, we hypothesize that the self-rated mental health of transgender people is worse than that of cisgender people. We also hypothesize that these differences will be incompletely explained by sociodemographic factors, reflecting the effects of stigma and discrimination felt by the transgender community.

A complex probability sampling technique was used to sample English and Spanish speaking United States residents at least 18 years of age. For this analysis, survey data from 2014 to 2016 was pooled. 35 The BRFSS includes modules, which states may choose to include or exclude in their annual survey. In 2014, an optional ''gender identity'' module was added. This module was included by 20-26 states and territories during each annual survey from 2014 to 2016. In participating states or territories, survey respondents were asked, ''Do you consider yourself to be transgender?'' Individuals who identified as transgender were then asked, ''Do you consider yourself to be male-to-female, female-to-male, or gender nonconforming?'' We classified individuals as transgender if they affirmed transgender identity, and will use the terminology male-to-female (MTF), female-to-male (FTM), and gender nonconforming in this article to align with the terminology for minority genders used in the original survey. Given that individuals who stated that they were not transgender were not asked whether they were cisgender, or more precisely, were not asked their sex assigned at birth and current gender identity align, we will use the language non-transgender to refer to those respondents who did not identify as transgender, rather than the term cisgender. In 2014-2015 ''sex'' (not specified as sex assigned at birth or current self-identified sex) was determined by the interviewer, with ''clarification if necessary''; in 2016, respondents were asked, ''are you male or female?'' For the purposes of analysis, respondents were categorized as having a natal female sex if they identified as non-transgender and their sex was coded as female, or if they identified as transgender and FTM, regardless of documented sex.\nFrequent mental distress was the primary outcome of interest. Frequent mental distress is defined as 14 or more days in the last month of self-rated ''not good'' mental health. Frequent mental distress data provide an assessment of mental health in a single question, with excellent specificity and reasonable sensitivity. 36 Frequent mental distress was chosen as the primary outcome of interest, given known disparities in access of transgender individuals to the health system, and risk of provider conflation of gender dysphoria with other mental health diagnoses. 4 Ever having been given a diagnosis of a depressive disorder was considered as a secondary outcome of interest (Were you ''ever told you had a depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression?'').\nCovariates of interest included: age, race, marital status, education (less than college vs. any college), employment outside the home (self-employed or employed for wages vs. all other employment statuses), poverty, whether respondents had health care insurance, whether respondents had a personal health care provider, poor self-rated physical health (14 or more days of self-rated ''not good'' physical health in the last 30 days). Participant-reported annual household income range and size were used to create an ordinal measure of percentage of the federal poverty line. Annual household income was recategorized using the midpoint for each income range and to the 80th percentile of annual family income ($112,262) for those who selected the highest income category. 37 The recorded income was divided by 2014 household size-specific weighted average poverty thresholds. 37 General self-rated health (''Would you say that in general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?'') was dichotomized as poor or fair, compared to good, very good, or excellent.\nAll analyses were performed using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) using functions appropriate for complex survey sample analysis. We restricted the analytic sample to states that asked about transgender status and individuals who answered (n = 518,986). We performed design-adjusted Chi-square tests of the association of transgender identity with frequent mental distress. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to identify independent predictors of frequent mental distress, with gender identity as the independent variable of interest, using BRFSS sampling weights.\nFor modeling, the population was further restricted to exclude strata with fewer than two transgender respondents to facilitate multivariable regression analysis (n = 407,075). Variables significant in multivariate analysis or identified as clinically relevant based on existing research were selected as candidate variables in multivariable models. 23,28,38 Specifically, employment status was dropped given concern for collinearity with poverty, education, and insurance status, while insurance status was retained in addition to poverty given mid-income gaps in Medicaid eligibility. Models were created, including transgender status as a dichotomous variable (transgender vs. non-transgender), along with natal sex female (vs. not), and separately with a nominal gender variable (non-transgender male, non-transgender female, MTF, FTM, and gender nonconforming) to explore differences between the transgender and non-transgender population as well as potential heterogeneity within gender minorities.

Transgender individuals were also less likely to be married (42.6%   2). Rates of diagnosis of a depressive disorder among each gender category were higher than rates of frequent mental distress (Table 1).\nIn multivariable logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, race, marital status, education, poverty category, insurance status, and self-rated physical health, transgender identity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.49 [CI 1.14-1.96]), and female natal sex (aOR 1.39 [CI 1.32-1.46]) remained associated with frequent mental distress (Table 3, Model 1).

In addition, our findings indicate higher rates of frequent mental distress and depressive disorder diagnosis in transgender compared to non-transgender populations, consistent with previously published data. 4,[8][9][10] These findings remained statistically significant after controlling for age, race, marital status, college attendance, poverty, health insurance status, and poor self-rated physical health.\nWe found significant sociodemographic differences between the non-transgender and transgender population, including factors associated with mental health. 23,28,38 Consistent with previous studies, we found that the transgender community was more racially diverse than the non-transgender community, with a statistically smaller proportion of white non-Hispanic individuals and a larger proportion of Hispanic individuals as well as individuals identified with races or ethnicities other than white, black, or Hispanic (Table 1). 10 As expected, based on previous findings, we found that transgender individuals were also more likely to be in poverty, have poor or fair general health, report poor physical health, and were less likely to have attended any college, have health insurance, or have a primary care provider. 10,22 In contrast to analyses of the 2014 BRFSS data alone, where no difference in the proportion of married individuals was noted between the transgender and non-transgender population, we found that the transgender population was significantly less likely to be married than the non-transgender population. 10,22 This finding is likely a reflection of increased power with increased sample size.\nOur findings of higher rates of frequent mental distress and depression disorder diagnosis among transgender compared with non-transgender populations align with existing research on mental health outcomes in transgender compared with cisgender cohorts. 4,[8][9][10] However, few studies have explored differences in mental health outcomes within gender minority populations; those that have explored have inconsistently identified gendered differences and have been conducted using convenience samples that may lack   generalizability to the broader transgender population. In a predominantly white, highly educated (87.5% with some college or more), internet-based convenience sample survey of transgender individuals, higher rates of depression among transwomen compared with transmen were reported (49.1% vs. 37.3%). 8 Similarly, Clements-Nolle et al. found a trend toward higher rates of depression among MTF compared with FTM individuals in a convenience sample. 33 However, a retrospective chart review of individuals covered by a single health plan found a higher rate of depression among FTM compared with MTF individuals. 32 Our study suggests heterogeneity in mental health outcomes among various genders represented within the transgender identity. We found higher rates of frequent mental distress among the FTM and gender nonconforming populations, compared with the MTF population (Table 1). In adjusted multivariable models, non-transgender females, FTM, and gender nonconforming individuals had increased odds of frequent mental distress compared with non-transgender males, while there was not a statistically significant difference in odds of frequent mental distress between MTFs and nontransgender males (Table 4). These findings serve as a reminder to research and clinical communities to be cautious in recognizing the gendered differences that may be overlooked when work related to gender minority groups is simplified into a comparison of transgender and cisgender people. These findings suggest nuanced heterogeneity within various genders in the transgender population, just as there are known variances in genders within the cisgender population.\nExplanation for the higher rate of frequent mental distress among FTM individuals compared to MTFs and nontransgender males, is likely multifactorial, with possible contributions from biology and socialization. In binary comparisons of the mental health of adolescents, gender differences in depression among presumed cisgender boys and girls emerge at puberty; among girls depression is associated with body dissatisfaction and pubertal body changes, but has not been consistently associated with measures of femininity. 39 Self-rated mental health among the FTM indi-viduals may, in part, reflect effects of socialization as a young girl or of natal female biology. In addition, recent research suggests that transgender men are more likely to experience enacted stigma (e.g., verbal harassment, problems getting a job) compared with transgender women, which may, in part, explain higher rates of frequent mental distress in the FTM population. 8 Gender nonbinary individuals are rarely given opportunities to identify themselves in national surveys, which often offer only binary gender responses. Thus, little is known about the sociodemographic and health outcomes of nonbinary individuals. Our findings suggest that gender nonconforming individuals are more likely to attend college than MTF or FTM individuals, but are as likely to be in poverty (Table 1). Gender nonconforming individuals were also more likely than MTF to rate their general health as poor or fair, and were additionally more likely to have frequent mental distress when compared with MTF individuals. Given the impact of gender on health, and the widespread assumption of gender binaries in health care research, provision, and institutions, we hypothesize nonbinary individuals face unique challenges and may have different health outcomes than may be anticipated based on their sex assigned at birth. Unfortunately, in the survey data analyzed here, participant sex was obtained by interviewer assumption or by querying the respondent, but without specifying sex assigned at birth; we are thus unable to comment accurately on differences by sex assigned at birth among gender nonconforming individuals. Moreover, lack of clarity regarding sex data hinders data collection regarding natal sexspecific issues such as cervical cancer screening in this population. Mental health outcomes among nonbinary individuals may, in part, reflect lack of social acceptance and public understanding of nonbinary genders expression.\nSociodemographic diversity within the transgender community is also an important consideration in exploring physical and mental health outcomes. The disproportionate impact of poverty on the transgender community raises concerns for an impact on the mental health and overall well-being of gender minority individuals. At the population level, there is FIG. 1. Predicted probability of frequent mental distress in transgender versus non-transgender individuals by percent of the poverty line, generated from multivariable model in Table 3, Model 2. Points show expected value, whiskers show confidence interval. evidence both for poor mental health leading to lower earnings and low socioeconomic status causing depression. 23 In the setting of transgender identity, poverty adds additional economic barriers to medical gender affirming care and social transitioning, recourse in the setting of discrimination and violence, and access to postsecondary education. 3 While improvement in socioeconomic status is associated with lower odds of frequent mental distress in non-transgender individuals, this trend was not observed for transgender individuals (Fig. 1). We hypothesize that this finding reflects that while all disenfranchised people face economic barriers to health, transgender individuals continue to face significant barriers to health, such as discrimination and violence, even in higher income levels.\nIn comparison to non-transgender males, all genders had higher rates of ever having had a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. More research is needed to explore gendered differences in frequent mental distress and in ever having had a depression disorder diagnosis. Our findings may suggest a conflation or co-occurrence of transgender identity with depressive disorders across genders, a gendered difference in self-described mental health that is not reflected in depressive disorder diagnostic criteria, a gendered difference in seeking or responding to treatment, or a difference in the persistence of symptoms across genders.\nStrengths of the current study include the large, multistate probability sample, which offers improved national generalizability in comparison to convenience sample surveys. Our study is also strengthened by the exploration of differences between minority genders within the umbrella of transgender identity. The lack of inclusion of a two-step sex and gender question in the demographics section (to confirm both sex assigned at birth and current gender identity) may have caused individuals who are not cisgender, but do not identify as transgender, to not be captured appropriately, inaccuracies in our assessment of natal female sex, and prohibited an analysis of the gender nonconforming individuals by sex assigned at birth. 40 While this is a relatively large sample of a minority community, sample size constraints limit certain analyses and their interpretation.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings suggest significant heterogeneity within the transgender population, including differences in mental health outcomes between minority genders. More work is needed to explore differences in mental health outcomes for minority genders across the life course, including in relationship to puberty, to aging, and to gender-affirming medical care, as well as socioenviromental factors. Understanding the protective and provoking factors driving differences in mental health outcomes is critical to informing efforts to improve the mental health of transgender individuals and to stem the high rates of suicide in this population.\nResearch on the health of transgender individuals has been limited by inaccurate and conflated measures of sex and gender and rare inclusion of nonbinary genders. Beyond the limitations this creates for analyzing health outcomes for the transgender compared with cisgender population, it hinders efforts to explore differences in outcomes between various genders within the transgender population.

"Representation of Women Physician Deans in U.S. Medical Schools", "abstract": "Background: Among U.S. medical school deans, there is a wide gender gap, most prominent at the highest levels. We aimed to discover how well women physicians were represented within the pool of women deans compared with the pool of men deans. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 149 allopathic medical schools in the United States. For each school, information was collected on deans' names, titles, genders, and degree(s). Chi-square analyses were performed to determine association between gender and dean ranks. Results: Of the 2559 deans included from 149 medical schools, 1649 (64.4%) were physicians, and of these, women physicians accounted for 634 (38.4%), a significant under-representation ( p < 0.00001). In comparison, the 626 nonphysician doctorate-holders of which women accounted for 291 (46.5%, p = 0.061) were equally represented. Of the 284 deans with bachelor's or master's degrees, women accounted for 180 (63.4%), a significant over-representation ( p < 0.00001). This difference was most profound at the lower tier (assistant) dean level. A lower tier physician dean was 1.25 times more likely to be a man than a woman, and a higher tier (dean of medical school, senior associate, vice, or associate) physician dean was 1.16 times more likely to be a man. Conclusions: Women physicians were under-represented among medical school deans compared with men. This disparity held among lower tier and higher tier deans.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T he under-representation of women in U.S. medical leadership has been well documented. Although there are signs of overall improvement in gender balance, it is not clear whether women physicians are advancing since studies often include both physicians and nonphysicians. Regarding leadership positions, it is important to understand whether advances in gender equity extend to a subset of women in medicine-women physicians.\nThere are few published gender studies on the topic of medical school deans. White et al. analyzed 534 full and interim deans (496 men, 38 women) between 1980-2006, and found that women were more likely to hold decanal positions in less research-intense medical schools. 1 Recently, Schor found that women made up 44% of decanal positions nationwide, 2 including all ranks of dean. However, this study did not investigate the proportion of women physician deans. At the highest level, the percentage of women as deans (or interim deans) of medical schools was 15. 1 Notably, Schor found that there were differences in the types of decanal roles held by women-they were represented in greater proportions in areas focused on education, mentoring, and institutional image, as opposed to general, clinical, research, and corporate decision-making roles. 2 Physician workforce gender equity in academic medicine has been slow. 3 Given that in the United States, >50% of matriculating medical students are now women 4 and there are many well-documented gaps for physicians in promotion, 5 compensation, 6 and recognition awards, 7 it is important to evaluate not only the under-representation of women in medical leadership roles but more specifically gaps in women physicians in these roles. The term ''gender'' is used throughout this report as ''sex'' is biologically determined and was not evaluated. For similar reasons, we used the terms ''women physicians'' and ''men physicians'' rather than ''female physicians'' and ''male physicians.''\nIn this study, we analyzed the overall proportion of women physicians compared with all women deans and similarly assessed men physicians compared with all men deans. The gender distribution of deans at various levels was also analyzed. We hypothesized that women deans were less likely to be physicians compared with men deans. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the gender of medical school deans in various decanal categories (e.g., beyond the primary or interim dean) in addition to investigating whether women physicians (vs. nonphysicians) are represented in lower proportions compared with a similar analysis of men.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "A total of 149 allopathic medical schools in the United States, including Puerto Rico, were included in this study. Medical schools anticipating an inaugural matriculating class in 2018 or later were excluded. The Association of American Medical Colleges was queried to obtain data on titles, genders, and professional degrees of all deans at U.S. medical schools, but this request was declined. Thus, data collection consisted of searches on medical school websites for the terms ''dean,'' ''vice dean,'' ''associate dean,'' ''assistant dean,'' and ''leadership.'' These searches were performed between December 2017 and January 2018. Individuals listed as occupying a dean position were recorded, along with their gender and degree(s). For data consistency, only individuals holding the titles of dean of a medical school, vice dean, senior associate dean, associate, assistant dean, or an interim of one of these positions were included (Fig. 1).\nIf the degree(s) were not listed on the medical school website, an internet search was conducted to identify biographical articles, clinical practice sites, or LinkedIn profiles that contained this information. We investigated any duplicate names in our database to ensure that each individual was recorded in only their current position.\nTo determine gender, priority was given to biographical articles containing pronouns, which were found online for 95% of the individuals included in the study. In the absence of these, names and photographs were used to determine an individual's gender identity, a method used in prior decanal studies. 2 Individuals without pronouns or photographs were eliminated (Fig. 1). Deans denoted as physicians held an MD or equivalent degree (e.g., DO, MBBS, MB/ChB). All information collected was publicly available. This study was classified as nonhuman subjects research by the Boston University Medical Center institutional review board, and because all data were publicly available, an exemption was not required.\nFor ease of analysis, we categorized our data into three decanal tiers.

In comparison, women are over-represented among deans with terminal degrees at the bachelor's and master's level. In contrast, women nonphysician deans with doctorates occupy similar proportions of decanal roles to men deans at the level of vice dean and below. Disparities in the advancement of women physicians have been well established. [8][9][10] The lack of representation of women physicians among deans is one of many factors that may impact the promotion of women physicians in academia. Carr et al. followed 1273 faculty members for 17 years at 24 U.S. medical schools, and found that there were gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership across the trajectory. 8 Women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity. The authors recommended that institutions examine the climate for women to ensure that their academic capital is fully realized, and that they have equal opportunities for leadership roles. Other studies have also reported that women physicians have a lower rate of promotion to full professor after adjusting for age, experience, and metrics of research productivity. 9,10 Women physicians are under-represented in other professional arenas, such as medical society awards, 11,12 grand rounds lectureships, 13 and presence on editorial boards. 14 Historically, these disparities were explained as a ''pipeline effect,'' and it was assumed by many people that as more women became physicians, they would be promoted equitably. 15 However, more than a decade ago, researchers began to refute the pipeline as a reasonable explanation for leadership disparities. 16 Progress in the advancement of women in academic medicine was inexplicably slow in spite of a large body of literature documenting disparities, 17 Helitzer et al. refuted the theory of ''critical mass.'' 3 This theory assumed that when women reached a 30%-35% threshold-critical mass-of representation among medical school faculty, the academic workforce culture would change and facilitate women's advancement. 3 Instead of focusing on critical mass, Helitzer et al. suggested identifying ''critical actors''-leaders who will actively improve the culture of academic medicine. Although these leaders may be people from across the gender spectrum and have a variety of terminal degrees, we suggest that it is important to promote transformational women physician leaders to the highest levels, and ensure that they are equitably represented.\nIn his presidential address to the American Surgical Association, Keith Lillemoe, MD, PhD noted that only one woman physician had served as president of the organization in its 137-year history. He said, ''The number of outstanding, qualified female candidates is more than adequate to fill every open surgical leadership position in America today. The problem is not the pipeline-it is the process.'' 18 Our study highlights a hidden problem that may impact the culture of academic medical leadership. The ramifications of having a larger percentage of women with bachelor's and master's degrees in decanal roles are unknown. Physicians likely have a different network of colleagues and different skill sets compared with nonphysician deans without doctorates, though both skill sets are valuable for leadership. The medical  setting is also distinct from a broader university setting, in that the learners are primarily MD and PhD candidates. Files et al. studied a microinequality specific to academic medicine, the disparity in the introduction of women speakers by the title of ''Dr.'' at departmental grand rounds. 19 Professional titles based on training, as Files et al. say, ''convey expertise and competence.'' 19 At Harvard Business School, Battilana and Casciaro described how both formal authority and informal networks influence how effective people are at their jobs. 20 Formal authority is influenced by the amount and type of education and postgraduate training an individual completes.\nThe contributions of physicians and doctorate-level leaders to academic medicine compared with leaders with bachelor's and master's degrees have not been studied, but there may be important differences in the strengths, informal networks, and skill sets of each. The equitable representation of women physicians at all levels of academic leadership within medical schools is important to consider and study further.\nMany ideas have been proposed to explain disparities, including gender stereotypes, 2,21 prioritization of family needs, 2,3,22-24 lack of adequate mentor networks, 22,25,26 a culture of bias and discrimination, 3,22,24,25 unequal access to resources, 27 lack of self-promotion, 15 and schedule inflexibility. 26 Sponsorship has been cited as a critical element in career advancement, where a boss or other coworker who is in a position of authority actively advocates for a woman (or man) to be promoted or to receive other specific opportunities. This approach has been successful in the corporate world, and has been suggested as an approach for women in medicine. 28 Some institutions have begun training programs on unconscious bias for the members of their promotions committee, as well as initiating career development programs 29 and instituting flexible career plans 30 aimed at fostering the careers of individual women. The Association of American Medical Colleges and National Institutes of Health have initiated mentorship and professional development programs for women. These programs have been found to improve retention of women faculty in academic medicine. 23 Perhaps similar programs could be initiated for those interested in attaining decanal positions or ascending among the decanal ranks.\nThis study has several limitations. While the Bonferroni method keeps Type I error constant at 0.05, it does so at the expense of inflating Type II error, 31 thus there may be additional significant differences in our study that did not meet the threshold p-value. Of note, only one statistical test in our study yielded a result between 0.05 and 0.0026.\nOur data set is reflective of the accuracy of individual medical school websites as well as online biographical information. We determined an individual's gender preference to the best of our abilities using pronouns as a primary gender marker 95% of the time. If these were not available, we used a combination of name and photograph.\nTo facilitate data analysis, we grouped the deans into three broad categories; however, it is possible that a given title may hold a different position in the decanal hierarchy in various institutions. Osteopathic medical schools were not included in this study, and the data from these programs may differ.\nPossible areas for future study include investigations of the reasons underlying the discrepancies reported in this study. Another area of potential investigation is the impact of women deans of medical schools on retention of women faculty and representation of women physicians and nonphysicians within decanal roles over time.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Women physicians occupy a significantly lower proportion of decanal roles compared with men physicians.

However, the distance U.S. abortion patients travel has not been reported since 2008, and no study has examined reasons abortion patients choose the particular facility where they obtain their abortion. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the 2014 Abortion Patient Survey and Abortion Provider Census to report abortion patients' one-way travel from their resident zip code to their abortion clinic, whether they went to the closest clinic, and reasons for facility choice. We report unadjusted and adjusted associations of patients' characteristics with travel distance and differences in average travel distance by abortion patients' reported reasons for choosing their facility. Results: In 2014, 65% of abortion patients traveled less than 25 miles one-way, 17% traveled 25-49 miles, and 18% traveled more than 50 miles. Abortion patients who were white, college-educated, U.S.-born, \u202112 weeks pregnant, and lived outside metropolitan areas were more likely to travel farther. Nearly half of abortion patients went to their nearest provider and 32% chose their facility because it was the closest.These results indicate that travel distance is an important determinant of abortion care access in the United States.

Hellerstedt upheld that increased driving distances can contribute to an undue burden on access to abortion care. In the United States, 95% of abortions were provided in specialized clinic settings in 2014, and 39% of U.S. women of reproductive age lived in a county with no such clinic. 3 In 2008, the most recent year for which there are data, 67% of U.S. abortion patients traveled less than 25 miles (one-way), and 6% traveled more than 100 miles. In adjusted analyses, abortion patients who were white and had graduated college traveled farther on average than black and Latina patients and those who had graduated high school or less, respectively. Abortion patients who did not live in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), urbanized areas of 50,000 or more population, 4 and those who obtained abortions beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to travel farther than their counterparts. 5 Changes in the distribution and type of abortion facilities may affect how far people must travel for abortion services. 6,7 Between 2008 and 2014, the number of abortion clinics in the United States declined 7%, from 851 to 788. 3 During this time, three states also implemented bans on abortions to those whose pregnancies are 22 weeks or more from the last menstrual period. Some women may have had to travel farther to obtain abortion care because of clinics closures and abortion bans. However, others may have been unable to overcome the increased distance and thus prevented from obtaining abortion care at all. 8 Several studies have found that greater distances to abortion facilities are associated with increased burden among patients, including higher associated out-of-pocket costs, 7 greater difficulty getting to the clinic, 7 negative mental health outcomes, 9 higher likelihood of emergency room-based follow-up care, 10 delayed care, 11 and decreased use of abortion services. [12][13][14] Similar burdens have been documented in Canada, which bears both cultural and infrastructural similarities to the United States. 15 In Texas, increased distance to the nearest abortion provider after clinic closures in 2013 was associated with a decrease in the abortion rate, 16 and in particular, among counties where the distance to the nearest abortion provider increased by \u2021100 miles, the number of abortions to county residents declined by 50%. 17 Another study estimated a 69% decline in the \u202116-week abortion rate to Texas residents after nonhospital \u202116 week abortions became unavailable and the average distance to the nearest provider increased by 219 miles. This estimate accounted for secular decline in the abortion rate and Texas residents who still obtained out-of-state abortion care, suggesting that many women could not overcome the additional travel distance to farther facilities after their local providers closed. 18 Abortion access is also determined by factors other than distance; individuals seeking abortion care must weigh preferences, needs, and available resources against considerations such as the procedure fee, health insurance coverage, availability and timing of appointments, type and severity of restrictive abortion laws where they live, type of procedure offered (medical or surgical), and pregnancy gestation limits. 9,19 As a result, some patients may travel farther than their nearest abortion provider if they can, although the proportion of abortion patients who travel beyond their nearest provider, how much farther they travel, and for what reasons have not been studied in a national sample of abortion patients.\nThe aims of this study were to describe the distance U.S. abortion patients traveled for abortion services in 2014, the proportion of abortion patients who went to their nearest provider, and patient characteristics and reasons patients chose the facility where they obtained their abortion associated with travel distance.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This cross-sectional, descriptive study uses the 2014 Abortion Patient Survey, which is nationally representative of nonhospital abortion patients in the United States. 20 This study obtained human subjects ethics approval from the Guttmacher Institute's federally registered Institutional Review Board. A detailed description of the dataset is published elsewhere 20 ; a synopsis is provided below.\nBetween April 2014 and June 2015, a four-page questionnaire (available in English and Spanish) was distributed to all patients who obtained an abortion at each of 87 participating facilities; each facility's data collection period lasted a 2 to 12week fielding period inversely proportional to the facility's size. During the 14-month fielding period, facilities provided 11,024 abortions and returned 8,380 patient surveys, representing a 76% response rate. Questionnaire domains included demographic information and abortion and other reproductive healthrelated experiences, including reasons the patient selected the facility at which they were obtaining an abortion. It also requested participants' resident state and zip code. Weights were constructed to account for nonresponse, rendering the data representative of all U.S. women obtaining abortions.\nWe calculated two distance measures. The first was the one-way distance from each patient's resident zip code to the abortion facility where they obtained their abortion; in other words, the distance actually traveled for abortion services. We used the ''traveltime3'' program in Stata, which accesses the Google Maps application programming interface, to calculate driving distance in miles between patients' zip codes and facility zip codes. Distances for 33 patients for whom the areas between their zip code and abortion clinic traversed undeveloped land (i.e., forests, bodies of water) were calculated using Google Maps individually since these calculations returned errors in traveltime3. Patients who obtained abortions in their resident zip code were coded as having traveled zero miles. One-way distance traveled to the abortion facility was recorded into a categorical variable indicating less than 25, 25-49, 50-100 and >100 miles; these categories were used in previously published research. 5 The second distance measure was the one-way distance to the abortion clinic nearest to each patient's zip code. Using Guttmacher Institute's 2014 database of all known abortion facilities, we found the nearest health care facility defined as a health care facility that provided at least 400 abortions in 2014, or Planned Parenthood affiliate that provided at least one abortion in 2014, by straight-line distance from each patient's zip code centroid using Maptitude. As per previous research, these metrics are meant to identify access points for abortion care that are accessible and discoverable by people seeking abortion care. 21 We then calculated the driving distance using ''traveltime3'' and subtracted it from the distance each patient actually traveled to determine the proportion of patients who went to their nearest abortion provider, and among those who did not, how much farther than their nearest provider they traveled.* Eight percent of abortion patients (n = 633) did not provide a valid zip code and were excluded from analysis. This level of missing information was similar to the overall level of nonresponse on sensitive items, and Chi-square statistics revealed that those patients for whom we lacked distance information did not differ from the full sample of patients on any characteristic (not shown). We excluded 44 patients as outliers because they traveled more than 400 miles, were vast majority \u202118 years old, obtained first trimester procedures, and lived in states with multiple abortion providers. These cases likely represent students living away from home, patients traveling for vacation, to areas where friends or family reside, or for other reasons, and therefore, do not represent the typical abortion patient in terms of travel burden. Although an additional 15 patients met these same outlier criteria, we included them in the analysis because they lived in Alaska and did not cross state lines to obtain an abortion, and therefore more likely represent the typical abortion patient in their state.\nWe hypothesized that 14 independent characteristics and two policy measures would be associated with travel. The first policy measure was whether patients lived in a state with a waiting period law; this included ''two-visit'' laws *Respondents who traveled within 1 mile of their nearest provider were coded as having traveled to their nearest provider (traveled zero miles) since Google Maps does not calculate to this level of precision (i.e. the same calculation could be more than 1 mile different on two separate tries for the same calculation). In addition, patients who traveled very small distances, such as 1 mile, beyond their nearest provider, could be traveling the same as or negligibly farther distances than their nearest provider if they lived in a geographically large zip code or on the border of their zip code.\n(requiring an in-person visit to the abortion facility followed by a waiting period of at least 24 hours before obtaining the procedure), ''24 hour'' laws, (requiring patients to wait at least 24 hours from making their appointment before obtaining an abortion without a requisite in-person visit), or no waiting period law. The second policy measure was whether minors lived in a state with parental involvement laws, including parental notification and parental consent laws. Demographic variables included age, U.S.-born or not, education level, poverty status (according to percent of federal poverty level), relationship status, parity, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was measured by first asking ''Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latina?'' and then asking respondents to choose one or more races they consider themselves to be. Responses were coded into the following categories: black, white, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, or Other. ''Other'' includes respondents who chose American Indian, Other, or marked more than one race. We coded respondents who identified as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latina as Hispanic regardless of race. Situational variables included the number of disruptive life events the abortion patient experienced over the last year, pregnancy gestational length (\u00a312 weeks, 13-15 weeks, and \u202116 weeks) and how they paid for the abortion. We also categorized patients by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), whether they lived in an MSA, and whether they crossed state lines to obtain an abortion.\nWe tabulated the percent distributions of patient characteristics overall and by category of distance traveled using Chi-square statistics to assess significant differences. We modeled all variables using ordered logistic regression model, a regression technique that assumes that the proportional relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same. In other words, the relationship between those traveling the least distance compared with all higher categories of distance is the same as relationship between the next lowest category and all higher categories. Margins were calculated to obtain predicted probabilities of each category of distance traveled for the selected characteristics while holding all covariates at their means.\nWe also report travel distance by reasons patients chose the facility where they obtained their abortion. In response to the question ''Which, if any, of the below influenced your decision to come to THIS particular facility?,'' patients could choose as many of the 11 closed-ended responses and ''Some other reason'' (which included a write-in text box) as applied to them. We present the nine most commonly reported reasons; all other reasons were reported by \u00a31% of respondents each. We compared the average distance traveled and distance to the nearest provider among those who chose each reason to the distances of those who did not choose that reason using t-tests. We conducted all analyses in Stata version 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Abortion patients traveled a mean of 34 miles one-way to the facility where they obtained their abortions, with a median of 16 miles (Table 1). Two-thirds (65%) of abortion patients traveled less than 25 miles, 17% traveled 25-49 miles, 10% traveled 50-100 miles, and 8% traveled more than 100 miles. The mean distance to the nearest provider was 22 miles, with a median of 9 miles. Nearly half of all abortion patients obtained an abortion at their nearest provider (47%), and 6% traveled \u202150 miles farther than their nearest provider.\nDemographic characteristics of U.S. abortion patients in 2014 have been published elsewhere, 20,22 but we describe several variables not previously reported; for example, 89% of abortion patients resided in an MSA (Table 2). Among abortion patients aged 17 and younger, 55% lived in state requiring parental involvement to obtain an abortion. Nearly a quarter (24%) of abortion patients lived in a state with a two-visit waiting period law.  Several characteristics were associated with travel distance in unadjusted analyses. The proportion of patients living in a state with a two-visit waiting period law were twice as likely as those who lived in a state with no waiting period to have traveled more than 100 miles one-way (10% vs. 4%); those in states with waiting period laws not requiring two visits were three times as likely (14% vs. 4%). Among abortion patients aged 17 and younger, 11% of those in a parental involvement state traveled more than 100 miles compared with 2% in states with no such law. White patients and ''other'' race/ethnicity-identified patients were most likely to travel more than 100 miles (10% and 20%, respectively); only between 5% and 6% of black, Latina/o, and Asian patients traveled more than 100 miles. There were no differences in travel distance by age, number of previous births, number of disruptive life events, or poverty level.\nThe proportion of abortion patients at \u202116 weeks of gestation who traveled more than 100 miles was twice that of those at \u00a312 weeks (14% vs. 7%). Patients who crossed state lines for their abortion were eight times more likely to travel more than 100 miles than those who did not (36% vs. 4%) Abortion patients living outside an MSA were eight times more likely to travel more than 100 miles than MSA-resident abortion patients (36% vs. 4%).\nAbortion patients from the Midwest had the smallest proportion of patients traveling less than 25 miles (50%) for an abortion and the greatest proportion traveling more than 100 miles (14%). In contrast, more than three quarters of Northeast-resident abortion patients traveled less than 25 miles, and just 2% traveled more than 100 miles.\nMost associations in the bivariate analysis were maintained after controlling for other variables with the exception of region of residence and marital status { (Table 3). Patients who lived in a state with a required waiting period (but without a two-visit requirement) had more than 1.5 times the odds of traveling each category of distance farther compared to those who lived in states with no waiting period. Black patients were half as likely to travel each category of distance farther compared with white patients, and non-MSA residents had 12 times greater odds of traveling compared to MSA residents. Compared to patients with some college education, those with less than a high school education had 30% lower odds of traveling each category of distance farther. Compared to those obtaining abortions at \u00a312 weeks of pregnancy, patients obtaining abortions at 13-15 weeks had 1.5 times greater odds of traveling each category of distance farther, and those at \u202116 weeks had 2.8 times the odds of traveling farther. Patients using private insurance to cover their abortion had 20% lower odds of traveling each category further compared to those paying out-of-pocket. Patients who crossed state lines for abortion services had five times greater odds of traveling each category of distance farther compared to those obtaining an abortion in their state of residence.\nWhen asked why they obtained an abortion at the particular facility they did, 66% of respondents chose one reason; 30% gave more than one reason, and 5% gave no reason (not shown). Among abortion patients who provided a reason, nearly one-third (32%) said they chose their particular facility because it was the closest (Table 4). There was no difference in average miles traveled between those who went to their facility because it was closest and those who did not choose this reason; however, those who chose their facility because it was closest lived farther from their nearest provider compared with those who did not choose that reason (27 vs. 20 miles, p < 0.01).\nAbortion patients reported several aspects of clinical services that influenced their decision of facility. The 13% of abortion patients who chose their facility because it could schedule them the soonest traveled an average of 41 miles whereas those who did not choose this reason traveled an average of 32 miles ( p < 0.01), although there was no difference in distance to the nearest abortion facility between these groups.\nSimilarly, the 2% of abortion patients who were too far along in pregnancy to go to other providers traveled an average of 72 miles compared to an average of 33 miles traveled by those who did not choose this reason ( p < 0.01). Notably, when restricting the comparison to only those patients who obtained abortions at <16 weeks, those who were too far along still traveled farther on average-68 miles compared with 33 among those who did not choose this reason (p < 0.01) (not shown).\nThe 15% of patients who chose their clinic because it offered medication abortion lived on average closer to their nearest clinic (20 vs. 23 miles, p < 0.001) and traveled a shorter average distance (28 vs. 35 miles, p < 0.01) than those who did not. Similarly, those who chose their clinic because it  ", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "This study provides the first update of the distance U.S. abortion patients actually traveled one-way to the facility where they obtained care since the baseline was established in 2008. Nearly two-thirds of abortion patients (65%) traveled less than 25 miles for services in 2014, a proportion similar to the 2008 estimate of 67%, 5 despite some changes in the abortion service landscape and the national abortion patient profile since that time. Still, more than 17% of those obtaining an abortion in 2014-some 155,000 peopletraveled 50 miles or more for abortion care. We also show that the provider being the closest was a main reason abortion patients chose their facility and that nearly half of all abortion patients traveled to their nearest provider, indicating that distance is an important determinant of abortion access. Some groups of abortion patients were more likely to travel farther in 2014, in particular, more than 100 miles, compared to their counterparts. White patients, collegeeducated, and U.S.-born patients were more likely to travel farther for an abortion, which may reflect that these groups have more material, informational, and social resources to be able to travel, while those without the resources to travel the same distances are not represented in this sample if they were unable to overcome those obstacles. Farther travel among patients at higher gestational lengths likely reflects that abortion services at the second trimester are less commonly available and those patients therefore must travel beyond their nearest provider to obtain care. Notably, 36% of patients residing in non-MSA regions traveled more than 100 miles for abortion services, the largest proportion of any group, reflecting a considerable travel burden where services are not geographically accessible. 21 We also found that abortion patients who lived in states with two-visit requirements and adolescents who lived in parental notification states traveled farther. While these policies in and of themselves do not affect distance to a clinic, states with these restrictions may also be more likely to enforce restrictions that lead to clinic closures or prevent providers from offering abortion care. For example, in 2010 every state with a two-visit law also enforced at least two other major abortion restrictions. 23 If so, this finding is concerning given that emerging research has shown that multiple restrictions compound the burden of obtaining abortion care, particularly for those who already have limited resources to overcome them. 7,9 This is the first U.S. study to assess the proportion of abortion patients who traveled beyond their nearest provider, how much farther they traveled, and the reasons they chose the clinic they did. Most abortion patients (81%) went to their nearest provider or within 15 miles of their nearest provider, and nearly one-third said they chose their clinic because it was the closest. While distance was the most common reason abortion patients chose their facility, this was just one factor they weighed. There was no one majority reason for abortion patients' choice of facility and more than a third of respondents reported two or more reasons. Our results suggest that some individuals travel farther to get the care that is best for them. Both abortion patients who reported they chose their facility because it provided the soonest appointment and those who reported they were too far along in pregnancy for other providers traveled substantially farther for care compared to those who did not give these reasons, despite no difference in distance to the nearest provider between the groups.\nIt is important to note that we describe crude associations between distance and reasons for clinic choice, and some associations likely are not due to distance, per se. For example, it is possible that patients who lived in urban areas, and therefore closer to providers, were able to prioritize reasons for clinic choice that did not relate to distance.\nA limitation of this study is that data came from individuals who obtained abortions; therefore, those who were unable to present at an abortion facility-because of distance or other barriers, such as gestational limits-are not included. The Turnaway Study, which documented the experiences of people unable to obtain an abortion because of clinic gestational limits, found that a primary reason for delays is time spent gathering funds for procedure and travel costs, and that some 4,000 such people per year may be denied wanted abortion care. 8 Another limitation is that this nationally representative study cannot detect changes in distance traveled at the state or region level where clinic closures may have left some areas with fewer or no providers. For example, more than half of Texas abortion facilities closed after a restrictive abortion law, House Bill 2, was introduced in 2013 and this led to the distance to the nearest abortion facility to increase from 15 to 35 miles among 2014 Texas abortion patients. 7 Finally, our survey excluded patients obtaining abortions in hospitals, where an estimated 4% of abortions were provided in 2014. 3 If hospital abortion patients traveled closer or farther than nonhospital abortion patients, our distance estimates could be biased. Emergent models of health care delivery could reduce the travel burden among rural individuals in particular. Pharmacy provision of medication abortion could reduce travel distance for abortion patients; however, the Food and Drug Administration's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for one of the drugs used in early medication abortion, mifepristone, prohibits dispensing it by pharmacy prescription. Current evidence regarding the safety of mifepristone indicates that the REMS is not necessary. 24 Similarly, telemedicine is used to deliver a range of reproductive health services 25 and is safe and effective for the provision of medication abortion. [26][27][28] Currently, 17 U.S. states ban telemedicine for abortion care specifically, despite evidence that it is safe, effective, and highly accepted by abortion patients. 29 Distance is a relative measure of one cost of obtaining an abortion. The burden travel places upon obtaining medical care depends on an individuals' context and resources, including access to private and public transportation, childcare, and paid sick time. Most individuals seeking abortion services in the United States are low-income, 20 and a nearly a third of patients said they chose their clinic because it was closest, suggesting that farther distances may be a salient barrier to timely and appropriate abortion care for many abortion patients.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled 9-month clinical trial, Heart Health 4 Moms (HH4M), among 151 U.S. women with preeclampsia within 5 years. Sample size was planned to detect differences of 0.5 standard deviation units in primary outcomes between study arms. Preeclampsia history was validated by medical records; women with chronic hypertension were excluded. The intervention included online educational modules, a community forum, and communication with a lifestyle coach. The control group received internet links to CVD risk reduction information. Primary outcomes were self-efficacy to eat a healthy diet and increase physical activity; change in physical in/activity; adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; and knowledge of and personal control over CVD risk. Secondary outcomes were weight and blood pressure. Results: In the intervention arm, 84% of participants accessed at least one online educational module; 89% completed at least three scheduled calls with the coach. At 9 months, intervention participants reported significantly greater knowledge of CVD risk factors (corrected p = 0.01), increased self-efficacy for healthy eating ( p = 0.03), and less physical inactivity than controls ( p = 0.0006). The groups did not differ in sense of personal control of CVD risk factors, adherence to the DASH diet, self-efficacy for physical activity, or reported physical activity. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between groups. Conclusions: The HH4M program improved CVD risk knowledge, self-efficacy to achieve a healthy diet, and reduced physical inactivity among women with recent preeclampsia.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I n their lifetime, 4%-8% of American mothers will have at least one pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder defined by new-onset hypertension in pregnancy with proteinuria or systemic manifestations. [1][2][3][4] Women with prior preeclampsia have four times the risk of developing chronic hypertension, and have double the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events in the decades after pregnancy. 5 Since 2011, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended that clinicians consider history of preeclampsia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and that obstetricians refer women with a history of preeclampsia to primary care physicians or cardiologists for monitoring and control of CVD risk factors. 6 Women with a history of preeclampsia have greater body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and higher levels of glucose, insulin, diabetes, and C-reactive protein, and they tend to develop these risk factors earlier than women with normotensive pregnancies. 7,8 However, many clinicians remain unaware of the implications of preeclampsia for chronic disease, and do not counsel lifestyle modifications that are proven to reduce CVD risk-diet, physical activity, weight management-to women with prior preeclampsia. 9 To understand the patient experience with primary care providers (including internists, obstetricians, and midwives) and their preferences for programs to reduce cardiovascular risk, we previously conducted focus groups with women from across the United States who had preeclampsia within the past 5 years. Patients said that they were motivated to improve their diet during pregnancy and wanted to continue a healthy lifestyle after pregnancy. Many women experienced preeclampsia as a ''wake up call,'' their first major health event. These findings support the notion that the postpartum period may be a ''window of opportunity'' for behavior change. 10 However, for women with young families, the lack of time to travel and cost of childcare required to participate in face-to-face programs provide major barriers to participation. 11,12 Internet-based health programs offer the potential to reach patients at home. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for web-based technology to improve care of chronic diseases, including diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and hypertension, 13 in the general population and for women with a history of gestational diabetes. 14 Based on the patient-provided recommendations from our focus groups and the potential for the internet to reach the population of women with recent preeclampsia, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of an internet-based lifestyle intervention, Heart Health 4 Moms (HH4M). Our primary aims were to test the extent to which the 9-month intervention would improve self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to make behavior change) 15 to reduce cardiovascular risk through healthy eating and physical activity; increase adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; increase physical activity; reduce physical inactivity; and improve patient knowledge of CVD risk after preeclampsia as well as sense of personal control over that risk.

Women were excluded if they were currently pregnant or had: diabetes, history of cardiovascular or kidney disease, gastric bypass or bowel surgery resulting in malabsorption, active medical problems affecting diet or blood pressure (including eating disorders, drug or alcohol addiction), or medications affecting weight or blood pressure. Women whose baby from the preeclamptic pregnancy had died or was not living at home at the time of enrollment were not included, as the intervention focused on lifestyle change incorporating infants and young children in the home. Inclusion criteria were evaluated through an online recruitment questionnaire, phone screen with a research assistant, medical record abstraction, and review of wirelessly transmitted weight and blood pressure readings. Women who became pregnant during follow-up were asked to discontinue the intervention and complete their final assessment at that point.\nParticipants signed a medical record release form that allowed study staff to obtain prenatal records, labor and delivery records, delivery discharge summary, and postpartum notes. Two investigators (E.W.S., G.S.) independently reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnosis of preeclampsia, using criteria from the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy: new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation (SBP >140 mm Hg and/or DBP >90 mm Hg, measured at least twice, 4 hours apart) with positive proteinuria (>300mg by 24-hour urine collection, urine protein:creatinine ratio >0.3, or positive urine dipstick \u20211+). 16 Elevated blood pressures during labor were not counted. Women with proteinuria and only one elevated blood pressure who had a clinician diagnosis of preeclampsia documented in the record were considered to have had preeclampsia. This definition was used to provide consistency in inclusion criteria throughout the years in which participants' preeclampsia was diagnosed. Women who were eligible following medical record review were mailed an electronic scale (iHealth \u00d2 Lite Wireless Scale, model HS4; iHealth Lab Inc., Mountain View, CA) and a blood pressure monitor (iHealth \u00d2 Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor BP5) to verify weight and blood pressure eligibility. Eligible women reviewed the consent form with a research assistant before signing and returning the form to the study team. Participants were then emailed a link to a questionnaire regarding demographics and baseline study measures.

Participants also received personalized lifestyle coaching from a registered dietitian trained in patientcentered counseling to help them set and meet positive lifestyle goals. Coaching was provided through six scheduled calls and three scheduled emails, with interim ad hoc communication as initiated by participants. Participants also had access to an online community forum where they could communicate with each other and the lifestyle coach, as well as a ''toolbox'' of additional resources, including meal plans, recipes, and videos demonstrating exercises that could be done with an infant.

For these measurements, participants were asked to weigh themselves twice in the morning wearing light clothes and to sit at rest for 5 minutes before taking four blood pressure readings, each 2 minutes apart. The average of the measurements was used in analysis.\nSelf-efficacy. To assess the primary aim of improving patients' self-efficacy toward achieving and maintaining a healthy diet and level of physical activity, we adapted the validated Sallis Eating Habits Confidence Survey and Exercise Confidence Survey scales. 19 Dietary change. To measure adherence to the DASH diet, we used the validated DASH Online Questionnaire, 20 a food frequency questionnaire, and adapted it by incorporating items from the validated Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire 21 to include more foods consumed by Hispanic populations. The questionnaire prompts recall of daily servings of foods and beverages consumed in the past 30 days. We adapted a measure of DASH diet adherence 22 to calculate a DASH score based on daily intake of eight components (fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, lean meats and poultry, and sweets). Quintile rankings were summed across components to obtain a summary DASH score for each participant that ranged from 8 to 40.\nPhysical activity and inactivity. To measure physical activity and inactivity, we adapted the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire, 23 a validated questionnaire for women that includes activities relevant to caring for young children. Our measure ascertained type, duration, and frequency of recreational activity and childcare activity. It also measured inactivity (sedentary behavior), such as reading, using a computer, and watching TV. The time spent in each activity is multiplied by its intensity (metabolic equivalent of task value) to yield the average weekly energy expenditure related to that activity.\nKnowledge of and control over CVD risk. We assessed participants' sense that they felt informed about CVD risk based on the question, ''How informed are you about hypertension and heart disease in women who have had preeclampsia?'' (not at all; moderately; well; very well informed). This is modeled on a CVD knowledge question used in an AHA survey. 24 To assess women's sense of personal control over their health, we adapted Kim and Walker's survey on perception of chronic diabetes risk among women with a history of gestational diabetes, 25 using factor analysis (with varimax rotation) to reduce seven items from the Kim scales to a single factor we named ''Personal Control over Cardiovascular Disease Risk.'' The resulting measure had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.73.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Overview. We followed the intention-to-treat principle and included all randomized participants. Primary outcomes were analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRMs), a special form of the general mixed effects regression model for longitudinal data. Specifically, treatment-by-time interaction contrasts provide direct estimates and statistical tests of the difference between intervention groups in mean change from baseline to 3-and 9-month endpoints. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the within-subject errors or correlation among the repeated measures on the same subject without making assumptions about within-subject variability. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To account for multiplicity due to the analysis of seven primary outcomes, the p-values for the difference in change between the study groups were adjusted using Hochberg's step-up testing procedure for these outcomes at 9 months. 26 For comparison with the literature, we also calculated effect size (ES) of the TRIAL TO REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK AFTER PREECLAMPSIA intervention as Cohen's d. The p-values derived from mixed effects model account for baseline values of the outcome, while effect size estimates do not; for this reason, we present only p-values from the mixed effects model to assess the role of chance.\nMissing data. Missing data ranged from 0% to 9% for primary outcomes, with the exception of the 9-month DASH Food Frequency Questionnaire for which 19% were missing. The MMRM models incorporate partially observed data on subjects; based on a ''missing at random'' assumption, the likelihood-based MMRMs provide valid inferences on intervention effects with incomplete data.\nSample size. Based on previous literature, we calculated that a sample size of 150, evenly split between arms, would yield at least 80% statistical power for two-sided hypothesis tests at a = 0.05 to detect -0.5 standard deviation (SD) unit differences between study arms in the continuously measured outcomes, such as the self-efficacy scales. One woman was censored shortly after randomization when she moved outside the United States and consequently lost internet connection necessary to complete the outcome assessments. Because we were still recruiting patients at the time she dropped out, we enrolled an additional patient to the intervention arm to compensate for the loss of statistical power.\nPatient-centered approach. A patient-centered approach was employed throughout the study. 27 Preeclampsia survivors affiliated with the Preeclampsia Foundation were involved in the design of all intervention content, website layouts, review and interpretation of results, and writing of the article (E.T.).", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Institutional approval", "text": "The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Partners Healthcare and all participants provided written informed consent.

We excluded 1,342 women: the majority (n = 871; 65%) did not meet study inclusion criteria, while others either declined to participate (n = 43, 3%), were lost to follow-up during the recruitment process (n = 167, 12%), had unattainable medical records (n = 1), or were still in the recruitment process when it closed because we reached our target enrollment (n = 260, 19%).\nBaseline characteristics of the 151 HH4M study participants are summarized in Table 1. On average, participants were 31.1 years of age, predominantly white non-Hispanic (n = 124, 82%) with a college degree (n = 106, 70%), overweight or obese (n = 95, 63%), and 1.3 years removed from their index preeclamptic pregnancy. Participants were most commonly recruited through the Preeclampsia Foundation (n = 69, 46%) or Facebook (n = 61, 40%) and lived in 41 states (Fig. 2). Average blood pressures were largely normal; only three women had SBP \u2021120 mm Hg or DBP \u202180 mm Hg. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the control and intervention arms.\nDuring the study, 69% of controls accessed the control website and all but one intervention participant (99%) accessed the intervention website ( p < 0.00001 for difference between arms). Eighty-four percent of intervention group participants accessed at least one educational module on the website. Eighty-nine percent of intervention group participants completed at least three of the six scheduled calls with the lifestyle coach.\nTen women became pregnant during the study and discontinued the intervention (three before the 3-month assessment; seven between the 3-and 9-month assessments). Another nine women did not complete the final assessment (one lost internet access before the 3-month assessment and eight were lost to follow-up between 3 and 9 months). Retention rates at the end of the 9-month intervention were 93% in the control group and 91% in the intervention group.\nAt baseline, none of the outcome measures differed significantly between groups. Table 2 presents the primary study results, comparing the difference in change in primary endpoints between control and intervention arms from baseline to 9 months. At 9 months, the difference between control and intervention arm participants' change in their self-efficacy to eat a healthy diet was statistically significant ( p = 0.005, Effect Size = 0.5, Hochberg corrected p = 0.03). Intervention arm participants had an average healthy eating self-efficacy score of 4.5 (0.6 SD) compared with a score of 4.2 (0.7) in control arm participants; the longitudinally adjusted difference in change over time was 0.2 units higher in the intervention participants than in control participants. There was no difference in change in physical activity self-efficacy between study arms at 9 months ( p = 0.20, ES = 0.4, corrected p = 0.60).\nChange in physical activity levels did not differ between study arms. However, physical inactivity (time spent watching television, reading, or on the computer) decreased more in the intervention group than in the control group over time ( p < 0.0001, ES = -0.5, corrected p = 0.0006). At 9 months of follow-up, intervention arm participants decreased their physical inactivity by an average of 7.8 hours per week more than had control arm participants. DASH diet scores remained relatively unchanged in both arms at 9 months.\nThe degree to which participants felt informed about the risk of hypertension and CVD in women with a history of preeclampsia increased in both groups over follow-up: from 2.0 (0.9) at baseline to 2.5 (0.9) at 9 months in the control participants and from 1.9 (0.8) to 2.7 (0.8) among intervention participants. The increase in knowledge was significantly higher among intervention arm participants ( p = 0.002, ES = 0.2, corrected p = 0.01). Sense of personal control over CVD risk did not differ between arms once corrected for multiple testing ( p = 0.03, ES = 0.0, corrected p = 0.12).\nSecondary outcomes were not impacted by the 9-month intervention. Average weight decreased by 0.7 kg in the control and 0.8 kg in the intervention arm, with no significant difference between arms ( p = 0.80). Mean SBP increased by 2.4 in controls and 0.2 mm Hg in the intervention arm; mean DBP increased by 1.2 in the control arm and 0.6 mm Hg in the intervention arm. These differences were not statistically significant ( p = 0.89 for SBP and 0.16 for DBP). she could not complete 3-or 9-month assessments. **Participants who became pregnant during follow-up discontinued the intervention and completed their final assessments (i.e., final questionnaire and final weight and blood pressure measurements) while pregnant. Women were asked to complete the final questionnaire relating back to the time just before they became pregnant. Women who became pregnant before the 3 or between the 3-and 9-month assessment contribute to the 3-and 9-month assessment totals, respectively, presented here. After completing those assessments, pregnant participants were censored from further follow-up.

Women in the intervention group reported large decreases in physical inactivity compared with the control group. There were no differences observed in other primary outcomes: self-efficacy for physical activity, adherence to the DASH diet, personal control over CVD risk, or self-reported physical activity. The AHA recommended in 2011 that clinicians consider a history of preeclampsia as a CVD risk factor, and physicians implement Class I Lifestyle Recommendations for women with a history of preeclampsia, including: (1) smoking cessation; (2) DASH-like diet; (3) regular physical activity; and (4) weight management. 6 While websites can be found regarding these lifestyle recommendations, no integrated programs have been designed specifically for the needs of women with a history of preeclampsia with an infant or young child at home. Our work has shown that this population faces specific barriers, 11,12 some of which may be overcome with a web-based program that eliminates travel and provides a community of women with similar experiences. Web-based programs may be particularly effective in postpartum populations. 14 A primary aim of HH4M was to improve self-efficacy of participants to improve their diet and physical activity. Selfefficacy is defined by Bandura as an individual's judgment of his/her capabilities to perform skills to attain a certain outcome. 15 Self-efficacy for new behaviors has been shown repeatedly to predict the attainment and maintenance of new behaviors as well as reattainment if relapse occurs. 18 An increase in self-efficacy positively impacts management of a wide spectrum of chronic diseases. 28 The changes in self-efficacy achieved in the present study are comparable or greater than those reported for health behavior change in other populations. The effect size (Cohen's d) of the change in self-efficacy for healthy eating that we achieved (0.5) was twice that achieved in an online intervention to increase healthy eating in college students (0.2). 29 Similarly, the effect size of the change in self-efficacy for physical activity at 9 months (0.4), while not statistically significant, was large relative to the effect size (0.16) reported by a meta-analysis of 27 interventions aimed at improving self-efficacy for physical activity, which included studies conducted via face-to-face and phone counseling sessions; email feedback; and behavior change classes and discussion groups. 30 As we observed a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy for physical activity at 3 months (effect size = 0.2), more work needs to be done to determine what factors led to this loss of self-efficacy for physical activity by 9 months.\nIn 2004, the AHA surveyed American women including the question, ''How informed are you about heart disease in women?'' 24 Responses ranged from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very well) and the mean score was 3.1. When we asked participants ''How informed are you about hypertension and heart disease in women who have had preeclampsia?'' at baseline, scores were 2.0 (control) and 1.9 (intervention) (Table 2). This suggests that women may feel less informed about CVD risk after preeclampsia than about CVD risk in general. By the end of the study, these scores had risen to 2.5 (control) and 2.7 (intervention), with intervention participants reporting a statistically significantly greater increase in knowledge about CVD risk than the control group.\nWomen in the intervention arm had significantly lower physical inactivity at both 3 and 9 months. Over 9 months, the FIG. 2. Geographic distribution of HH4M participants across the United States. The above map of HH4M participants was created through http://batchgeo.com (BatchGeo LLC). intervention group's physical inactivity fell by 27%, compared with 7% in the control group. The effect size (-0.5) is slightly higher than the effect size (-0.4) from a metaanalysis of six controlled trials of combined physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions, 31 suggesting that new mothers are able to reduce inactivity at least as much as other population groups.\nWe did not see concomitant increases in physical activity in the intervention arm. Self-report questionnaires, such as the one we used, can be insensitive to change in lightintensity physical activities, which may explain the discrepancy between the large drop in inactivity and the lack of a corresponding increase in activity. 32 An objective measure of physical activity, such as accelerometer, may improve measurement in future studies.\nWe saw no improvement in the DASH diet score despite improvements in self-efficacy for healthy eating. Some of our dietary counseling departed from the original DASH diet, to reflect updated standards of healthy eating. For example, the Lifestyle Coach counseled against excessive fruit juice consumption, and advised patients to switch healthy fats for unhealthy fats (e.g., replace trans fats or saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats). The online food frequency questionnaire we utilized may not have been as sensitive to diet change as food records or 24-hour recall, which have more participant burden.\nThe HH4M intervention did not have an impact on the secondary outcomes of weight loss or fall in blood pressure. The main emphasis of the intervention was healthy eating rather that weight reduction. However, as 60% of the population had a BMI \u202125 kg/m 2 , future iterations may benefit from an emphasis on weight loss for women with overweight or obesity. All study participants except three had baseline normal blood pressure (<120 mm Hg SBP and <80 mm Hg DBP). As per protocol, we excluded women who developed chronic hypertension between pregnancy and study recruitment. As a result, women who progressed from elevated blood pressures to chronic hypertension within 5 years of pregnancy (our recruitment window) may have been missed by our study. However, as 58% of participants were less than a year since pregnancy, this is unlikely to be a large reason we observed, on average, normal blood pressures. Given the normal blood pressure profile of the cohort, no fall in blood pressure would be expected from the DASH diet. 33 However, the DASH diet may be effective in lowering blood pressure in women with a history of preeclampsia with higher blood pressures.  In the HH4M intervention arm, 84% of participants accessed at least one online educational module and 89% completed at least three scheduled calls with the coach. Two successful lifestyle intervention programs used remote education and counseling to reduce postpartum weight retention in women with recent gestational diabetes. The Balance after Baby intervention 14 recruited women from the Boston area and provided web-based educational modules and lifestyle counseling delivered via telephone and/or email; 50% of participants self-reported completion of 9 per 12 modules and 50% completed 7 per 12 lifestyle coach contacts. The Gestational Diabetes' Effects on Moms program recruited women from an integrated health care delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California Perinatal Center) to offer a printed lifestyle guidebook and telephone-based lifestyle counseling; 50% of participants completed one or more telephone sessions with the coach. 34 Although not directly comparable-HH4M participants were recruited via the internet and received neither in-person clinic or study contact-the degree of HH4M participant engagement with HH4M's resources falls within the range of these studies. In the future, engagement with HH4M may be increased by the use of an application (app) for easy access or by integrating HH4M within a clinical care system.\nOne of the study's strengths was that it recruited women from 41 states. A limitation of the study is that participants were predominantly white and educated beyond high school. Most women found out about HH4M because they were proactive enough to seek out information about preeclampsia from the Preeclampsia Foundation website or Facebook. As a result, it is likely that the women in our study had greater selfefficacy and a healthier lifestyle at baseline than might be expected in a population that did not self-refer; this may explain why our participants had lower weight and blood pressure than suggested by studies following women after preeclampsia. 35,36 A more diverse population of women, such as those referred to HH4M by a clinician, might benefit even more from HH4M's health empowerment, information, and coaching. It is important to also note that the control group received more information than most women receive as ''usual care,'' in which many clinicians are unaware of, or do not communicate, the increased risk of CVD to mothers with a history of preeclampsia, nor provide counseling to reduce that risk. 9,11,12 The enhancement of the control arm might lead to an underestimation of the potential impact of implementing HH4M in actual care settings.\nThe HH4M is, to our knowledge, the first trial of an intervention to reduce CVD risk in women with a history of preeclampsia. With patient input, we created an educational resource that is easy for new mothers to access, designed specifically to address their history of preeclampsia and its future health implications, and tailored to their changing lifestyle as new mothers. Taking into account feedback from participants, the next iteration of HH4M will include a mobile app that will enhance or add features that participants found especially valuable. Targeted health apps may be an effective way to reach groups that identify with shared health history and concerns.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This trial demonstrates that women with recent preeclampsia will actively engage for many months with a web-based program to improve their long-term cardiovascular health.

This time corresponds with a significant stage in adolescents and young women's academic lives at both school and in higher education. Dysmenorrhea may cause absenteeism from class or result in reduced classroom concentration and performance. Owing to cultural and economic differences, any impact may vary by country. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in young women and explores any impact it has on their academic performance and other school-related activities. Materials and Methods: A search in Medline, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was carried out in June 2018. Results: Thirty-eight studies including 21,573 young women were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-three studies were from low-, lower middle-, or upper middle-income countries, and 15 studies were from high-income countries.

The majority of this literature is from low-and middle-income countries, where menstrual rates and the subsequent impact may be significantly different due to cultural taboos around menstruation and lack of support structures at school. This lack of support includes not being able to access facilities to change sanitary products without humiliation or embarassment. 10 Cultural and social factors are also likely to influence the prevalence and reporting of dysmenorrhea. 11 For instance, there is variance in the prevalence of dysmenorrhea reported in surveys between different cultural groups, even when geographical locations are similar. 12,13 It is currently unclear whether the differences in prevalence rates are due to biological or cultural factors; however, it is possible that the difference may be due, at least in part, to the presence of a public ''culture of silence'' around menstrual issues in some traditional cultures, demonstrated by women under-reporting primary dysmenorrhea in surveys, but showing similar rates across cultures in physicians' consultations. 11 The availability of new data from these countries may give more insight into the impact of menstruation worldwide. Previous studies have reported that among school-age adolescents and young women across a wide spectrum of social and cultural groups, dysmenorrhea causes educational absences, [13][14][15][16][17][18] as well as reducing young women's capacities to concentrate, participate, and apply test-taking skills, thereby adversely impacting on overall grades. 16 It is often suggested that the severity of dysmenorrhea reduces with age, 19 so women at university may experience less negative impact than those at school; however, data on this comparison are currently lacking.\nOwing to the potential impact that dysmenorrhea and the associated symptoms have on young women's academic performance at a critical stage in their academic lives, 17 an accurate understanding of the prevalence worldwide and how this affects young women in different countries are vital to identify the potential impact on young women's future prospects.\nThe aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the overall rate of dysmenorrhea in young women globally and to explore the impact of dysmenorrhea on attendance and classroom performance at school, university, or other higher educational institutes.

The LMIC subgroup included countries such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and India, where menstrual taboos are more prevalent [58][59][60] and, therefore, reporting rates on menstruation and related issues is expected to be lower due to stigma, shame, or misinformation. However, despite these expected differences in reporting, there was no difference in overall prevalence rates between HIC and LMIC. This suggests that strategies to assist young women in managing dysmenorrhea are as important in HIC as in LMIC.\nMost studies did not provide the definition they used for dysmenorrhea, and this is likely to, at least in part, explain the varying rates of dysmenorrhea between surveys. 14,61 A common theme regardless of geographic areas or cultures 16,62 is that most young women think period pain is a normal part of becoming a woman. 63 Additionally many young women were unable to identify the symptoms of dysmenorrhea. 28 Therefore, given the normalization of pain by young women, surveys that did not provide a definition of what constitutes dysmenorrhea (e.g., pain in the lower abdomen just before or during menstrual bleeding) may have resulted in an underestimate of the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in this meta-analysis. This is due to potential FIG. 3. Prevalence of secondary symptoms of dysmenorrheal; bloating, breast tenderness, emotional changes, and fatigue.\nIMPACT OF DYSMENORRHEA ON YOUNG WOMEN 1167 misunderstandings of how much pain is ''normal'' and, therefore, not worth reporting. The severity of menstrual pain was not consistently reported, with only three articles reporting dysmenorrhea scores via a VAS or NRS, with the remainder using ''mild, moderate, severe'' or some variation thereof. This classification system is not unusual as clinicians tend to use a scale of mild, moderate, or severe depending on how daily living is impacted, 64 and there are prespecified scales using this criterion. 65 However, the definition of pain scores that were classified into these three groups was not consistently applied and this prevented meaningful comparisons between studies. Reporting of secondary symptoms was more consistent, and very common, with almost half (48.3%) of young women reporting secondary symptoms. Future studies should endeavor to use a standard self-report scale such as a VAS or NRS for pain to allow comparison between populations.\nThe impact of menstrual symptoms on education was significant, with around one in five young women (20%) being absent and 40% reporting that classroom performance (such as concentration levels or test-taking abilities) had been negatively affected. This illustrates that girls and young women may be significantly disadvantaged in their studies by the impact of dysmenorrhea. Hillen et al. succinctly sum up the possible impact of these academic restrictions on young women, stating that ''School attendance and ability to concentrate on studies in Grades 11 and 12 are vital, as achievement in these high school years has significant longterm consequences for an individual.'' 17 Our subgroup analysis suggests that this negative impact starts at school and continues relatively unchanged when young women progress to university/tertiary education. Previous systematic reviews on dysmenorrhea have suggested that as women age, the prevalence of dysmenorrhea decreases, 15,66 Latthe et al. found dysmenorrhea prevalence decreased with age, but in their review the subgroup analysis was age >30 years compared with age <30 years. 15 Our findings do not support any significant reduction in prevalence with increasing age in this younger population, where the majority of women were <25 years. It is also important to note that the severity of dysmenorrhea does not appear to reduce significantly over time, even after age 25 years, 67 and a significant proportion of women with severe dysmenorrhea may go on to develop more persistent pelvic pain symptoms. 68 These findings also have implications for teachers, curriculum, and pedagogy. Teachers, particularly health educators, need to have knowledge about dysmenorrhea to be able to educate young women about the condition and provide appropriate suggestions for material and emotional support. Although apparent in the syllabus, teachers may or may not address the topic adequately or, in some instances, at all. As Duffy et al. found, teachers, particularly in primary school education, demonstrate little confidence in teaching about ''sensitive'' topics, including menstruation. 69 Dysmenorrhea is, therefore, likely to be omitted from classrooms, disadvantaging the young women who experience the condition and reinforcing its invisibility in learning contexts. Thus, awareness needs to be raised in teacher education courses and professional learning provided for current teachers. Greater explicitness is required within school curriculum documentation to increase awareness and ensure the topic is adequately addressed. In addition, enhancing teacher awareness generally may have implications for pedagogy; that is, teachers need to provide young women who have missed lessons or who have poorly absorbed information due to the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, opportunities for additional pedagogical support. Even simple accommodations such as allowing more time during tests or extensions on the submission dates of tasks may be useful and contribute to a more equitable learning environment.\nOther activities either directly school-related (such as sports) or social activities were also commonly affected in around a third of young women. Although there was no significant difference between absenteeism in LMIC and HIC, the trend toward greater absenteeism in LMIC found in the data may reflect the possibility that women in LMIC could be missing school not necessarily due to pain alone, but rather due to lack of sanitary products needed for menstrual management. 10 Once again, schools could provide support through on-going and targeted programs to provide sanitary products and information on effective pain management options such as ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 9,70 and, where appropriate, NSAIDs could be dispensed in line with school policy and parental consent. This is especially important for disadvantaged young people to ensure that they have the means to manage their period, and in doing so, continue to attend school and avoid absenteeism on this basis.\nThere are a number of strengths in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched for articles across a range of databases and used dual data extraction via a prespecified data extraction form to ensure rigorous data collection. Decisions on how to determine a country's status used the four tier World Bank system 23 rather than the more simplified ensure even better relevance to girls' needs.

We examined whether similar disparities existed among keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lecturers in a broad range of medical specialty conferences from 2013 to 2017. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 27 U.S. medical specialty conferences for which data were available on plenary speakers, keynote speakers, and/or invited lecturers. For each speaker, gender and degree(s) were determined. Fisher's exact test was performed to compare proportions of women among speakers to Association of American Medical Colleges' (AAMC) physician workforce data on gender distribution. Results: In aggregate, we identified 246 women among 984 speakers, significantly lower than expected when compared with 2015 AAMC data (25.0% vs. 34.0%; p < 0.00001). Compared with AAMC data reported in 2013, 2015, and 2017, women were significantly underrepresented in 2013 ( p = 0.0064) and 2015 ( p = 0.00004). In 2017, the proportion of women among invited speakers trended lower than AAMC active women physicians but did not reach significance ( p = 0.309). Analysis of individual conference data stratified by year indicated that, while the representation of women among all speakers improved between 2015 and 2017, the representation of women among keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lectureships was variable (including zero levels some years during the study period) and remained lower than expected as compared with workforce data for specific medical specialties. Conclusions: Evaluating for and improving disparities is recommended to ensure gender equity among invited speakers across all medical specialty conferences.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "G ender-related differences exist in medicine, particularly at the highest levels of leadership and academic rank. 1,2 In a 2015 report, Carr et al. described the lack of parity as well as compensation disparities for women in academic medicine. 3 In a follow-up 2018 report, Carr et al. found that gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership persisted across the career trajectories of faculty, and women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity. 4 Moreover, despite a seemingly adequate critical mass (e.g., pipeline), women in academic medicine are not advancing at the expected rate. 1 In specialties where women outnumber men, disparities continue to exist, in areas such as authorship, 5 recognition awards, 6 and medical specialty society leadership. 7 Speaking opportunities are an important part of an academic's career and are nearly always included in the formal criteria for promotion from instructor to professor levels. Lectures also provide visibility and enhance people's reputations in ways that, while challenging to measure, are undeniably crucial. Disparities have been found to exist not only in the proportion of women featured as grand rounds speakers, but in the rate at which they were introduced by their formal title (i.e., Doctor). 8,9 Medical societies are designed to support their members' professional careers and provide many speaking opportunities. Silver et al. explained the role that societies have in academic promotion and career advancement and highlighted gender disparities in recognition awards, 6,10,11 particularly for those that are associated with lectureships. 11 Few studies have focused on gender disparities on the podium at medical conferences [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] ; however, there is robust ongoing conversation about this issue on social media and on independent websites, 19 with images that show examples of all-male panels (called ''manels'') and presentation of data that highlight the exclusion of women as speakers, including keynote or plenary speakers. This latter category is particularly prestigious and provides individuals with considerable visibility, similar to colloquium lectures in academia. Nittrouer et al. found that women were underrepresented as speakers at prestigious universities across six disciplines when compared with men. 20 Some scientific fields, such as microbiology and virology, have been active in identifying and addressing gender-related disparities among speakers. [21][22][23][24] In this study, we hypothesized that women in general-and more specifically women physicians-were underrepresented among keynote and plenary speakers and invited lecturers at a broad range of medical specialty conferences. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore genderrelated differences among speakers across multiple major medical societies at annual conferences.", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "Gender representation among speakers associated with plenary lectures, keynote lectures and invited lectureships was evaluated over a 5-year period (2013-2017) in a crosssectional study of U.S. medical societies associated with the 39 specialties reported by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 2016 as having the largest number of active physicians. 25 Two medical specialties from the 2016 Physician Specialty Data Report were excluded at the start of the study: neonatal/perinatal medicine and internal medicine/pediatrics. Physicians practicing in these two specialties generally belong to societies that were already determined to be included in the study (e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics).\nFor each specialty listed, one major medical society was identified. The largest and/or most influential society in each field was chosen. Emails were sent to each society requesting information about annual conference plenary and keynote speakers. Of the 39 societies, 17 returned lists of speakers and four sent conference programs or subsets of programs. However, 18 societies did not provide data following this initial request. Of these 18, 13 had programmatic data available online for review. For each society from whom a response was not received, information about the annual conference plenary and keynote-type lecture was collected from society websites, news and press releases, and online searches. Information was not available for five societies. These societies were therefore excluded from analysis: College of American Pathologists (Anatomic/Clinical Pathology), American College of Emergency Physicians (Emergency Medicine), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism), American Society of Plastic Surgeons (Plastic Surgery), and Society for Vascular Surgery (Vascular Surgery).\nThereafter, another six societies were excluded from analysis for failing to meet a minimum threshold of five data points: American College of Gastroenterology (Gastroenterology), American Geriatrics Society (Geriatric Medicine), American Society of Hematology (Hematology and Oncology), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (Interventional Cardiology), American Society of Neuroradiology (Neuroradiology), and American Urologic Association (Urology).\nWe defined a plenary or keynote as either a session given this designation or a session that all attendees could attend without potential conflict with any concurrent session. Invited lectureships were also included if they were not associated with a recognition award, the Presidential Address, or a targeted minority group (e.g., the Olga M. Jonasson lecture at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress). Presentations with a single speaker and multiple authors listed in the program were also excluded as these were typically representative of a submitted abstract rather than an invited session.\nThe study period was defined as January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. All data were collected and verified by two researchers. Each society who did not send data initially (n = 18) was contacted by email twice requesting verification of the information. Another two societies who sent copies of meeting programs that contained eligible data were contacted for data verification. Verification of information gathered online was obtained from 5 of 13 societies. During the verification process, one society recommended changes to the list-despite speakers who met our study's criteria as plenary speakers, the American Academy of Ophthalmology declined having any keynote or plenary speakers at their annual meeting.\nThe list of medical specialties and gender-related physician workforce data (physicians in active practice) were obtained from the publicly available 2014, 2016, and 2018 AAMC workforce data books sourced from the American Medical Association (AMA) physician Masterfile reporting data from 2013, 2015, and 2017, respectively. [25][26][27] During analysis, data were compared with the AAMC data from the respective year, except when 2013-2017 data were analyzed in aggregate. During aggregate analysis, 2015 AAMC data were used for comparison because 2015 was the midpoint of the study period.\nName and terminal degree(s) were collected for each speaker, and physician status was defined as an MD, MBBS, or DO degree.

Assessing gender-related differences between our conference data in aggregate compared with 2015 AAMC data (midpoint of the study period), women were significantly underrepresented ( p < 0.00001). AAMC data on the proportion of women physicians nationwide was available for 2013, 2015, and 2017. [25][26][27] Comparing this to our data from these respective years revealed significant underrepresentation of women in 2013 and 2015 ( p = 0.0064 and 0.00004, respectively). In 2017, the overall percentage of women rose to 31.9%, still lower than the percentage of practicing women physicians (35.2%), but not statistically underrepresented ( p = 0.309). When separated by terminal degree, women accounted for 22.4% of physician speakers (n = 180 of 802) compared with 36.3% of nonphysician speakers (n = 66 of 182), a significantly lower proportion of women physicians compared with nonphysicians ( p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2). Women physicians were similarly underrepresented ( p < 0.00001) compared with 2015 AAMC data.\nSeparating aggregate data by conference, 10 of the 27 (37.0%) medical specialty conferences had women invited speakers equal to or in excess of the proportion of women actively practicing in the specialty in 2015 (Table 1), although none of the conferences had a statistically significant overrepresentation in aggregate over the five study years. However, 17 of the 27 (63.0%) medical specialty conferences had fewer women speakers than active physicians in each specialty. Specifically, four conferences had a statistically significant underrepresentation of women keynote and plenary speakers and invited lecturers compared with 2015 AAMC specialty data by gender: American Society of Anesthesiologists Annual Meeting, American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, American Academy of Pe-diatrics National Conference, and American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting.\nThe remaining 13 conferences also had percentages of women speakers lower than the proportion of women physicians in the specialty, although these differences did not reach significance.

Analysis revealed variable inclusion of women among speakers by year, with at least 1 year during the last 5 years of each conference featuring zero women among keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lecturers (Fig. 4A, B). Interestingly, within the four medical specialty conferences with the greatest overrepresentation of women speakers when compared with AAMC workforce data (American Association for Thoracic Surgery Annual Meeting, American Society for Radiation Oncology Annual Meeting, American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Annual Meeting), three societies also had years with zero women invited speakers (Fig. 5A-D).", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 5}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "Herein, we explored gender-related differences among keynote and plenary speakers and invited lecturers across 27 U.S. physician medical society annual conferences. Women made up more than 50% of medical students, 28 44% of assistant professors, 35% of associate professors, 22% of full professors, 14% of permanent clinical department chairs, and 16% of medical school deans as of 2015. 29 A promotional gap for women physicians exists even after controlling for productivity metrics and years of experience. 30,31 Despite some signs of improvement in specific specialties, 32 women are broadly underrepresented in senior leadership roles, a disparity that has been found to be independent of numbers of publications. 4 Key metrics for promotion include invited conference presentations, grand rounds and visiting professor    educational rather than technical sessions. 12 Similarly, another study analyzed all speakers at eight emergency medicine conferences and found a similar gender breakdown to AAMC data. 15 Mehta et al. evaluated all speakers at five international critical care medicine conferences over 7 years and found that women were underrepresented, but that two of the five societies had improved proportions of women over time, and that the disparity was greater among physicians compared with nonphysicians. 13 A recent study found that women were underrepresented as single podium speakers at the American Society of Anesthesiology Annual Meeting from 2011 to 2016. 16 Data from the American Society for Surgery of the Hand Annual Meeting was analyzed from 2010 to 2016 and the authors found that all women presenters (combination of speakers, moderators, and poster presenters) were represented similarly to the percentage of United Statesbased women society members, although somewhat lower than the proportion of United States-based women attending the meeting. 17 In addition, at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology Annual Meeting, women were underrepresented as conference speakers (all sessions) if they were below the rank of full professor. 18 Comparing the proportions of women as keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lecturers to their representation FIG. 3. Representation of women among plenary, keynote, and invited lectureship speakers at included medical specialty society conferences during 2013-2017, stratified by specialty society. Because 2015 was the midpoint of the study period, the benchmarks used for statistical comparison (black bars) are the percentages of women among active physicians as reported by the AAMC in 2015. Results are sorted by relative representation of women among included speakers, from least to greatest. *Statistical significance. among active physicians in practice across a broad range of medical specialties, we found a significant underrepresentation of women overall in 2013 and 2015. In contrast, a larger proportion of women were among speakers in 2017, and this number was not significantly lower than expected based on AAMC workforce data. These data indicate an apparent overall shift toward equity in this metric, and with intentional action to recruit women and underrepresented individuals to speak, and/or hold committee and leadership positions, a timely point of equity is within reach.\nAnalysis of individual conference data stratified by year indicated that, while the representation of women in aggregate may have improved, underrepresentation of women among keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lectureships may still be much lower than expected from workforce data within specific organizations. Moreover, both the number of and proportion of women among invited conference speakers was highly variable between conferences as well as from year to year within conferences, with some years during the study interval with zero women among keynote speakers, plenary speakers, and invited lecturers.\nThese gender-related differences are likely multifactorial in their origins. Women are underrepresented as medical specialty society award recipients, 6,10,11 grand rounds speakers, 8 journal editorial board members, 35,36 in the numbers and impact of their publications, [37][38][39] and in National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grant funding.

Our study is limited to 5 years of archival data for major conferences of U.S. medical societies. Although the annual meetings included in this study are pri-marily clinical, subsets of speakers are invited from the research arena or from a different specialty.\nAn additional limitation of this study is data accuracy. To mitigate this limitation, we requested plenary, keynote, and invited lectureship speaker information from societies directly, and when we did not receive a response, we provided societies the data we collected for verification. Information about terminal degrees was often, but not always, present on lists received from societies and conference brochures.

Strategies used by societies whose plenary speakers reflect the composition of the specialty should be codified and shared as best practices. Moghaddam and Gur describe the steps they undertook to correct the gender disparity in plenary and competitively chosen speakers within panels and study groups at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Annual Meeting, namely increasing the number of women on the scientific program committee and mentoring women, underrepresented minorities, and early career scientists and clinicians in the call for proposals. 14 The NIH published a policy in 2003 that ''organizers of scientific meetings should make a concerted effort to achieve appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in science, in all NIH sponsored and/or supported scientific meetings.'' 47 Regardless of funding sources, it is the responsibility of all medical specialty societies and their conference conveners to evaluate and eradicate gender inequities with regard to highprofile invited conference speakers, society and conference leadership, and affiliated journal editorial boards, when these are within their domain, including the development of speaker diversity policies and reporting on outcomes.

We describe the growing evidence of subtle disparities, or micro-inequities, that cause women to be less visible and marginalized. Over time, early career women transition to mid-career with an accumulation of these micro-inequities. Women have more difficulty in building their academic portfolios and curriculum vitae-core components of academic promotion. They comprise greater than 50% of the health care workforce; yet, they are underrepresented in top leadership positions. For example, only 22% of full professors, 18% of department chairs, and 17% of medical school deans are women. Macro-inequities, which are observable and measurable, are also well documented. For example, women receive less compensation than men for the same job.

Since diversity affords strength, innovation, and increased productivity to organizations, the evidence suggests that gender diverse teams may be more successful. It is thus beneficial for organizations to have women present and leading. 1,2 Diversity can mean many different things, including the impact that race, ethnicity, background, and other factors play in creating work environments. For this article, we focus on gender equity and women in the mid-career. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the compounding effect and importance that intersectionality plays for mid-career women.\nHighly qualified women can be disregarded, ignored, and fall out of academic consideration as they mature from the training and early career to mid-career stages. The phenom-enon of invisibility that occurs at the academic mid-career has been described, and we build upon this premise. Our primary goal is to describe what happens, and secondarily, we offer potential solutions.\nThe invisibility of some mid-career women Women comprise greater than 50% of the health care workforce; yet, they are underrepresented in top leadership positions. For example, only 22% of full professors, 18% of department chairs, and 17% of medical school deans are women 3 Moreover, women are less likely than men to hold the rank of Associate or Full Professor, even after adjusting for factors that may be associated with academic advancement, such as age, years since residency, publications, grants, clinical trials, medical school ranking, and total Medicare payments. 4,5 A recent study found that no women held presidential leadership positions among 10 major medical specialty societies in the last decade. 6 Even among specialties with a high number of women entering the field (e.g., Pediatrics and Obstetrics-Gynecology), women are proportionally underrepresented as chairs and vice chairs. 7,8 In 2007, Carnes and Bigby published a provocative editorial ''Jennifer fever in academic medicine.'' 9 The authors described a phenomenon that more than a decade later is relevant to the mid-career invisibility of many women. Trainee and early career stage women, or ''Jennifers,'' receive professional attention and a professional development focus by their more senior male colleagues and superiors. However, attitudes shift and as they advance to mid-career: the intentional attention and support wane and these women become invisible. The authors describe a pattern of mythologizing and ''justified distancing'' of women in the midcareer as they become more of a threat. Seven years later, Kaatz and Carnes published an editorial building on the ''Jennifer fever'' concept and illustrated an invisibility pattern as women progress through career stages. 10 The authors explain that superiors pay attention to women at the early stage of career, when they are young, less accomplished, and less threatening. However, as they gain experience and accomplishments, women are often dismissed and marginalized based on gender stereotypes.

Early career women may leave academic medicine for a myriad of reasons, and compared with men, they leave at lower academic ranks. 11 Narratives of physician self-reported reasons highlight a lack of later career stage role models, difficulty in obtaining research funding, work-life balance challenges, and an institutional culture, which favors men. 12 Academic productivity may be influenced by family and/ or work-life choices, which some women make in their early careers. Yet, the literature shows that this does not adequately account for gaps in mid-career representation. Instead, there are systemic forms of bias, which prevent women from achieving what would be anticipated based on their education, training, and academic accomplishments. Implicit bias, for example, is unconscious and is a set of commonly held beliefs about a certain group. An illustration of implicit bias is determining that women are nurturing and communal and therefore not good leaders. Organizational bias is more difficult to identify as it is woven into the organization's culture. Therefore, the organizational leaders and strategic team have integrated this bias such that decisions are not based on merit. An illustration of organizational bias is a perpetual pattern of appointing men to department chair positions despite a pool of equally qualified women. Relatedly, stereotype threat is a phenomenon whereby members of a certain group characterized by negative stereotypes perform below their actual abilities. The negative emotional impact of negative stereotypes may cause stress, anxiety, or disappointment, thus leading to underperformance and underachievement, or stereotype threat. For example, women in a sexist environment perform more poorly than in an environment not felt to be sexist and threatening. 13 The consequences of implicit and organizational biases accumulate over time. Thus, disparities in early career build, and by mid-career, women in academic medicine are often systematically disadvantaged. Too often the women, not the organizational systems that work against them, are blamed for this.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Inequities", "text": "In 1970, Chester Pierce, MD, coined the term microaggression to describe race-and ethnicity-based subtle snubs, slights, and insults. Often nonverbal, microaggressions target a marginalized group, and the cumulative effect of such experiences can cause harm. An example of a microaggression would be a woman physician introducing herself as Dr. XX yet being called by her first name ''X'' rather than by her professional title Dr. XX. In 1973, Mary Rowe, PhD, coined the term micro-inequities, which are less likely hostile or aggressive, but rather stem from unconscious bias. 14 In workplace cultures where microinequities are frequent, people become accustomed to them and do not see a need to address them. Micro-inequities and microaggressions are additive, burdensome, and they contribute to some women leaving at the mid-career stage. While micro-inequities are subtler and more difficult to measure, the macro-level gender inequities are not. Women lag behind men in countless areas: leadership positions, first authorship on publications, research funding, evaluations, awards, promotions, and salary. [15][16][17][18][19][20] Barriers to promotion and advancement may include inequities in speaking opportunities, lectureships, and award recognition, as these are line items on an academic curriculum vitae.\nMid-career is arguably when women most need robust letters of recommendation. They need speaking opportunities, with introductions that position them as subject matter experts. They need amplification of their work in medical society newsletters that go to thousands of colleagues, who may then think of them for future research collaborations, speaking opportunities, or nominate them for awards. Women are underrepresented as speakers at national conferences and academic grand rounds. 21,22 They are less likely than men to receive achievement awards and are less likely to be nominated. 18,19 Recommendation letters are shorter in length for women than for men and use less powerful language to describe women's professional accomplishments compared with those for men 23 ; women receive fewer formal introductions on the speaker podium 24 and are left out of medical society newsletters. 25 When women are not the lead authors on publications, are not introduced professionally or respectfully, and are equitably included on editorial boards, they slowly become invisible.\nSalary and promotion disparities are considered macroinequities; however, they are likely supported by many years of cumulative microinequities. Fair compensation is among the most important of the macro-inequities, and women physicians earn less than their male counterparts with persistent differentials noted even after adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, race, ethnicity, medical specialty, years in practice, patient care hours, and procedures performed. 16,26 Even when compensation appears to be comparable for people at the same level, women are often disadvantaged because they are not promoted equitably. For example, a woman who is an assistant professor for 10 years will receive less compensation than a man who is an assistant professor for 5 years and then is promoted to associate professor, and receives a greater compensation for 5 years.\nThere are gender disparities on many medical journal editorial boards, particularly at the highest levels. In general, women are underrepresented on medical journal editorial boards. And in a survey of 60 major medical journals, 16% of editors in chief and 18% of board members overall are women. 27 The underrepresentation of highly qualified women on editorial boards, including the position of editor-inchief, is itself a macro-inequity, and it may affect the ability of women to publish articles, obtain grants, and achieve promotions. [27][28][29][30] A final example of a gender-specific macro-inequity is the allocation of taxpayer dollars by government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Women receive merely 25% of the NIH grants and 21% of total funding. The NIH grants awarded to women are *80% of the grant funding amount awarded to men. 31,32 Such inequities lead to a lack of visibility of women in the most prestigious areas of academic medicine.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Pregnancy and motherhood", "text": "Pregnancy-and motherhood-related discrimination could occur at any career stage; yet, the immediate or downstream consequences are mostly likely apparent for a woman in her mid-career. If the structure and time clock for achieving progress in academia is not flexible enough to accommodate the competing domestic demands of families, then it is a woman's career trajectory, which most likely is negatively affected. 15 Time spent on domestic labor competes with time spent conducting research, and research is arguably an activity critical to academic promotion and success. 33 Disproportionately, having children negatively affects women's academic careers. 34 And, the evidence suggests that this type of gender-based discrimination remains common in medicine. 35 Women, who are mothers, report being subjected to higher standards as physicians as a test of commitment and competence. They report being passed over for leadership positions. They are left out of administrative decisions due to pregnancy or maternity leave, and they receive lower salaries than colleagues with similar levels of experience and productivity. Colleagues make disrespectful and disparaging comments. For example, they describe maternity leave as a ''vacation.'' Women physicians describe rules and expectations not expected of male colleagues, such as limited work leave options, and the need to find childcare to accommodate work hours. They describe a lack of alternative work schedules to support domestic responsibilities, and the pressure to complete administrative tasks after hours. 33 Maternal discrimination and its ultimate effects on women in the midcareer stage contribute to invisibility in a few ways. Women, who are mothers, may decide to leave their positions or to step out of academic medicine because they feel that they are not supported or respected. At the same time, organizations and their bosses make them invisible by not creating an inclusive and accommodating culture.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sexual harassment", "text": "Sexual harassment plays an important, increasingly appreciated, and measurable role in the actions and decisions of academic women physicians.

The report describes a culture, whereby sexual harassment and gender bias in health care have been normalized, and the true incidence and prevalence are probably higher than reported for a variety of reasons (e.g., underreporting by those affected). 36 Over time, sexual harassment and microaggressions build up and cause negative professional and psychological outcomes.

In other words, United Kingdom-based institutional leaders are held responsible to improve the status of women in their respective organizations, and the responsibility is not placed upon the women. 37 Traditionally, academic medicine has taken the bottom-up approach to gender equity, with much of the expectation of proof being placed upon women. The Charter intends to recognize and encourage a commitment to advancing the careers of women in STEMM by institutions of higher education and research. Since 2011, support from some United Kingdom funding bodies is tied to the level of Athena SWAN award held. 37 In their systemic review, Laver et al. similarly advocate for gender equity solutions that come from the top. 38 These are more effective, than those, which place responsibility on women to do the work themselves.

Mentorship is coaching and developing a relationship with an individual with the goal of professional growth. For these relationships, the mentor is presumed to have more experience and expertise than the mentee. Some studies report the positive effects of peer mentoring, specifically for skills and self-esteem building. 38 In contrast, sponsorship is the utilization of power and influence to advocate for an individual. There may not be a personal or ongoing relationship between the sponsor and the person being sponsored. However, the literature suggests that mentorship does not necessarily translate to promotions for women. 41,42 so sponsors are arguably the more important relationship. Sponsors have the position and power to advocate for advancement. Thus men, who occupy the majority of dean, chair, journal editor-in-chief, professor, and other leadership positions, have the ability to sponsor mid-career academic women, affect career advancement and elevate women to executive leadership positions.

Moreover, this admission highlighted an important issue-the NIH has had a longstanding policy focused on the inclusion of women on panels and other speaking opportunities.

We examined the prevalence and impact of sexual harassment using the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire, the standard for measurement of sexual harassment, but which has not been previously applied within academic medicine. Materials and Methods: A 20-minute online survey was administered to all faculty who had been working at University of Michigan Medical School for at least 1 year (n = 2723). We assessed sexual harassment within the past year from insiders (i.e., from staff, students, and faculty) and from patients and patients' families. We also evaluated mental health, job satisfaction, sense of safety at work, and turnover intentions. Results: In the final sample (n = 705; which included 25.9% of the originally targeted population), most respondents, 82.5% of women and 65.1% of men, reported at least one incident of sexual harassment from insiders in the past year; 64.4% of women and 44.1% of men reported harassment from patients and patients' families. The most frequently experienced dimension of sexual harassment for women and men was sexist gender harassment. Increased experiences of harassment were independently associated with lower mental health, job satisfaction, and sense of safety at work, as well as increased turnover intentions, with no significant interactions by gender.

[1][2][3][4] A recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) found that female medical students were 220% more likely than students from non-science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to have faced sexual harassment from faculty or staff. That report, after extensive review of the social scientific and legal literature, defined sexual harassment as consisting of three components: gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion. It further noted that many features of the medical profession, including its historical male dominance, strong hierarchies, and culture that often tolerates mistreatment, are ones that increase the risk of sexual harassment in the workplace more generally. 2 Limited empirical evidence exists regarding the rates or impact of sexual harassment within academic medicine specifically. Some studies have focused on physiciansin-training 5,6 and the few foundational studies seeking to evaluate prevalence in faculty samples have suggested that the rates of sexual harassment are substantial. [7][8][9][10][11] For instance, a recent study found that 30% of women clinicianresearchers reported sexual harassment from colleagues or superiors during their careers. 10 In addition, there is a small body of research pointing to patients and patients' families as another source of sexual harassment in medicine. 12,13 While these studies are valuable, many rely on outdated, incomplete, or subjective conceptualizations of sexual harassment. 14 Therefore, it has been difficult to accurately assess the rates of sexual harassment within academic medicine today. Organizational psychologists have developed extensively validated, behaviorally based survey instruments that capture all three dimensions of sexual harassment (gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion). [15][16][17] Research using such measures is urgently needed to gain an accurate and complete picture of sexual harassment in the medical profession.\nTherefore, we sought to systematically examine the prevalence of recent sexual harassment among a large sample of faculty currently practicing in an academic medical center, using scientifically validated measures. Furthermore, we expand the scant existing body of literature on sexual harassment of medical faculty by considering multiple sources of harassment (i.e., from institutional insiders-including staff, students, and faculty, and from patients and patients' families) and links between sexual harassment and physician mental health, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and sense of safety at work.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Materials and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study sample and survey administration", "text": "After formal designation as exempt from ongoing institutional review board oversight, in June 2018 we invited via email all faculty at the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) who had been working at the organization for at least 1 year to complete a 20-minute online survey about ''experiences with civility and respect in our institution.''

Pilot testing with academic medical faculty at other institutions was used to evaluate the final instrument before administration.\nSexual harassment. We measured experiences of sexual harassment using 20 items adapted from the Sexual Experi-ences Questionnaire (SEQ). 19,20 This behaviorally based instrument assesses three different types of sexual harassment: gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion. Participants were instructed-and reminded multiple times throughout-to only respond about ''UNWANTED behaviors SINCE JUNE 2017.'' Gender harassment items assessed ''verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility to, objectification of, exclusion of, or second-class status about members of one gender''. 2(p.14) Unwanted sexual attention items assessed unwanted sexual advances, including unwanted touches or attempts to establish a sexual relationship despite discouragement. Sexual coercion items assessed attempts to coerce compliance with sexual demands by making job-related threats or promising job-related benefits.\nSEQ-insider. We first measured participants' experiences of sexual harassment via unwanted behaviors from UMMS staff, students, and faculty (''institutional insiders''), both on and off campus. To do this, participants responded to all 20 items of the SEQ to indicate how often (0 = never, 1 = once or twice, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = many times) they experienced the ''UNWANTED behaviors SINCE JUNE 2017.'' Two of the 20 items were dropped because 100% of the sample indicated never experiencing those behaviors [''Exposed or sent pictures of their genitals to you'' (unwanted sexual attention) and ''Offered you something you wanted at work in exchange for doing something sexual'' (sexual coercion)]. Therefore, the final scale contained 18 items which were reliable for our sample (a = 0.79), and were averaged such that higher scores indicated more sexual harassment (M = 0.20, standard deviation [SD] = 0.24). SEQ-patient. We also measured participants' experience of sexual harassment in their interactions with patients and patients' families (patients/families). In the interest of time, participants who indicated that they worked with patients were given eight items of the SEQ, and indicated on the same scale how often they experienced these ''UNWANTED behaviors'' from patients and patients' families ''SINCE JUNE 2017.'' One of the eight items was dropped because 100% of the sample indicated never experiencing that behavior from patients or their families [''Made you worry you might be treated badly if you did not do something sexual'' (sexual coercion]. Therefore, the final scale included seven items, which were reliable for our sample (a = 0.74), and were averaged such that higher scores indicated more sexual harassment (M = 0.24, SD = 0.34) (Table 2).\nMental health. The Mental Health Index-5 is a widely used, well-validated screening instrument containing items from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. 21,22 Participants indicated on a five-point scale (1 = never, 5 = always) the extent to which they agreed with five statements about symptoms of depression (e.g., ''felt downhearted and blue'') and anxiety (''been a very nervous person''). Items were scored and averaged such that higher values indicated better mental health.\nJob satisfaction. We measured job satisfaction using three items from the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (C. Cammann, M. Fichman, D. Jenkins, J. Klesh, unpublished data). 23 Participants indicated on a five- point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) the extent to which they agreed with five statements about their job. An example item is ''All in all, I am satisfied with my job.'' Items were scored and averaged such that higher values indicate more job satisfaction (M = 4.05, SD = 0.80; a = 0.88).\nSense of safety at work. We assessed participants' subjective sense of safety on the job with one item, adapted from Clancy et al. ''I feel safe at Michigan Medicine.'' 24 Participants responded on a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree; M = 4.28, SD = 0.87).\nTurnover intentions. We measured participants' intentions to quit their job using four items. We drew the first item from the Turnover Intentions subscale of Balfour and Weschler's questionnaire on workplace commitment: ''I often think about quitting this job'' (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). 25 We developed three additional items designed to assess turnover intentions in the unique context of academic medicine (e.g., ''How often have you thought about changing your area of specialty?''; 1 = never, 5 = always).

Our sample modestly overrepresented women (48.3%, n = 336; compared to 43.2%, n = 1,177; p = 0.014) and faculty in the care of women, children, or families subspecialties (25.2%, n = 175; compared to 15.8%, n = 430; p < 0.001), and underrepresented research faculty (9.2% n = 64; compared to 13.2% n = 359; p = 0.021).

The most frequently experienced form of sexual harassment was gender harassment. Among women, 82.2% reported gender harassment from institutional insiders, and 64.0% reported gender harassment from patients/families. Among men, 64.9% reported gender harassment from institutional insiders, and 44.1% reported gender harassment from patients/families. The least frequently experienced dimension was sexual coercion: 2 women and 1 man reported coercion from institutional insiders and 0 reported it from patients/ families. Due to these low rates, we did not conduct further analyses on sexual coercion. Figure 1 depicts all observed rates.\nTable 2 depicts all behaviors assessed. Although we repeatedly instructed participants to only respond about ''UNWANTED behaviors,'' it is possible that some participants' responses included times when they perceived the behavior as humorous or enjoyable (i.e., ''displayed or distributed sexually explicit stories, pictures, or pornography,'' ''told sexual stories or dirty jokes,'' and ''tried to get you into a conversation about sex''). Thus, we recomputed the incidence rate of gender harassment without these three items and found similar results for gender harassment by institutional insiders among women (79.8%) and a still substantial rate among men (50.9%). We also recomputed the overall incidence rate for sexual harassment by institutional insiders removing these three items, and the incidence rate was again largely unchanged for women (80.4%) and remained substantial among men (51.7%). Thus, even by conservative estimates, more than half of the men and women in our study had experienced some form of sexual harassment from institutional insiders within the past year. All subsequent analyses used the full gender harassment measure, including these three items.\nAs shown in Figure 1, women had 2.50 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75-3.57, p < 0.001) times greater odds of experiencing gender harassment from institutional insiders and 2.38 (95% CI: 1.51-3.75, p < 0.001) times the odds of experiencing unwanted sexual attention from insiders than men. Women also had 2.26 (95% CI: 1.59-3.21, p < 0.001) times the odds of experiencing gender harassment from patients/families and 2.15 (95% CI: 0.95-4.83, p = 0.045) times the odds of experiencing unwanted sexual attention from patients/families than men.\nRates of gender harassment from patients/families also varied significantly across departments ( p = 0.038). Specifically, as depicted in Figure 2, examination of the adjusted residuals suggests that this effect is largely driven by disproportionately high rates of gender harassment from patients/families in internal medicine (adjusted residual = 2.6), and disproportionately low rates in surgery (adjusted residual = -2.3).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "FIG. 1.", "text": "Sexual harassment of faculty from insiders and patient and patients' families by faculty gender.

Across models, the interaction of participant gender with insider and patient/family sexual harassment was not significant, indicating that the strength of the association between experiencing sexual harassment and negative outcomes was similar for both women and men. In addition, seniority at UMMS predicted increased job satisfaction and decreased turnover intentions in the models with insider sexual harassment as well as patient/family sexual harassment; seniority also predicted better mental health in the model with insider sexual harassment.

These findings suggest that the actual prevalence of sexual harassment among faculty at this academic medical center is higher than estimated in earlier studies, and affects the majority of women as well as men. The overall rates of sexual harassment observed in this study are higher in comparison not only to most prior studies in medicine but also to studies in other fields using similar measures. 27 However, these higher estimates, particularly for men are similar to those found in a recently published report on rates of sexual harassment against physicians in Germany. 28 Consistent with studies in other work settings, the most prevalent form of harassment was gender harassment. 29 In particular, women frequently reported being mistreated, slighted or ignored on the basis of their sex, by institutional insiders. Although lacking the sexually predatory aspect of unwanted sexual attention or sexual coercion, social science has firmly established that gender harassment of this sort can have as detrimental an impact on well-being. 30 Moreover, nearly one in five women reported experiences of unwanted sexual attention from insiders, demonstrating that in the aftermath of #MeToo, this form of harassment is still present in academic medical contexts. Together, these rates of sexual harassment have major implications for the recruitment and retention of women in academic medicine-a field that is traditionally male-dominated.\nAlthough women respondents were significantly more likely to report gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention than men, the finding that most men had also experienced at least one form of sexual harassment in the prior year is noteworthy, challenging the common notion that sexual harassment only rarely affects men. Within gender harassment, men frequently reported being told sexual stories or dirty jokes that were unwanted. Three of the gender harassment items from the SEQ include behaviors that some might argue could be humorous or enjoyable (i.e., ''displayed or distributed sexually explicit stories, pictures, or pornography,'' ''told sexual stories or dirty jokes,'' and ''tried to get you into a conversation about sex''). However, we repeatedly instructed participants that they were only to respond about unwanted behaviors, and we observed substantial rates of gender harassment, regardless of whether such behaviors were included.

Indeed, men frequently reported being told sexual stories or dirty jokes that were unwanted, and we believe this suggests not that the SEQ overestimates harassment but rather that sexual banter, which some may assume is not bothersome to men, can be unwelcome regardless of the sex of the individual who experiences the behavior. Our findings in general, including those for men, may be due to increased sensitivity to all forms of sexual harassment following #MeToo. However, it is important to note that even if sensitivity to unwanted comments and behaviors has increased, the negative associations between these unwanted experiences and mental health and career outcomes remain strong.\nSpecifically, our results demonstrate that more frequent experiences of sexual harassment are associated with decreased mental health for both men and women. Research has demonstrated that the regular job demands associated with being a medical faculty member can undermine mental health, and it is possible that working in a climate that permits sexual harassment exacerbates this effect regardless of one's gender. 31 Furthermore, research has established a clear link between mental and physical health, and poorer FIG. 2.

SEQ is the validated Sexual Experiences Questionnaire that was modified for use to measure sexual harassment in the current study. mental health may have negative consequences on faculty's overall well-being. 32 Importantly our results demonstrate that sexual harassment has deleterious effects on career outcomes, including decreased job satisfaction, sense of safety, and increased turnover intentions. Turnover of medical professionals has large fiscal costs to health care organizations, including paying the direct (e.g., interviewing, recruitment, administrative, training) and indirect (e.g., time) costs of hiring replacements. 33 In addition, decreased job satisfaction among physicians is related to increased absenteeism and job burnout, and even riskier prescribing profiles, which could put patients at risk. 34 Furthermore, sexual harassment has been associated with performance declines in other professions, and future research should examine how sexual harassment experiences are associated with costly performance outcomes in medicine, with the possible risk of jeopardizing patient safety or quality of care. 35 We did not detect substantial differences in the prevalence of harassment by specialty, except for the observation of disproportionately high rates of harassment from patients in internal medicine, and disproportionately low rates from patients in surgery. Explanations for these findings may include differences in the duration, location, or urgency of interactions with patients in internal medicine versus surgical contexts. Further research is warranted that focuses on the nature of harassment in specific subsettings.\nTaken together, the high rates of sexual harassment observed in the current study point to larger systemic issues of sexism and sexual degradation within this academic context. When this harassment becomes severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of employment, it can potentially violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment lawsuits pose both a financial and reputational burden on institutions. It is imperative for academic administrators to create respectful environments and implement strong antiharassment policies and programs.\nThe current study yields new information about the associations between the full range of sexual harassment within a large cohort of physicians and other medical faculty and their well-being; however, our data are limited to one institution and one point in time, and in any observational study correlations may not be causal. Other organizations need to systematically investigate sexual harassment to understand the true extent and impact of sexual harassment in academic medicine. Selection bias due to nonresponse is always possible in a survey study, and while our study respondents were not substantially dissimilar to the overall population targeted, our sample did modestly overrepresent faculty who were white, women, and from women, children, or families' subspecialties. Even if rates were much lower among nonrespondents, the overall incidence of harassment in the underlying population would remain high enough to merit intervention, given the extremely high rates among those who did respond.\nIt is possible that this institution is an outlier; however, it is, on the whole, not remarkably different from many other large academic medical schools and teaching hospitals, so we anticipate that the rates of harassment in other institutions will mirror those we found. In the current study, we followed the best practices of behavioral science by asking only about behaviorally specific sexual harassment experiences from the recent past (i.e., past year). It would be helpful to examine the rates of sexual harassment within one context over time. Researchers should also test how the implementation of different policies impacts the rates of sexual harassment over the long-term, to inform continuing improvement in this setting.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This study demonstrates remarkably high rates of sexual harassment in a sample of current academic medical faculty and convincingly demonstrates an impact of harassmentincluding gender harassment-on faculty well-being.

Women represent a large portion of the talent pool in academia, and receive >50% of all PhDs, but this has not yet translated into sustained representation in faculty and leadership positions. Research indicates that women encounter numerous ''chutes'' that remove them from academia or provide setbacks to promotion at all stages of their careers. These include the perception that women are less competent and their outputs of lesser quality, implicit bias in teaching evaluations and grant funding decisions, and lower citation rates. This review aims to (1) synthesize the ''chutes'' that impede the careers of women faculty, and (2) provide feasible recommendations, or ''ladders'' for addressing these issues at all career levels.

[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] This disparity is even greater among under-represented racial/ethnic groups such as black and Hispanic women who comprise \u00a35% of tenured faculty in the United States. 3 These statistics only scratch the surface of data documenting the higher rates at which women leave academia (i.e., the ''leaky pipeline'' [13][14][15] ) and are prevented from rising in rank 13,16 relative to men. 3 While women leaving academia represent significant economic loss from years of investment in training, the cost of women not being promoted to highlevel positions may be equally significant. Gender diversity among leadership has been positively correlated with profits, productivity, and creativity, 17,18 thus earnings and prestige of academic institutions are likely compromised by the continued under-representation of women in high-level positions. More holistically, gender inequity in academic leadership results in educators not representative of our current and future society, 19 undermining the ability of academic institutions to create the inclusive learning environments and diversity in educational programming necessary to empower all students. 20 Transforming academia into an environment where gender equity is valued and achieved is essential to enhance its financial viability and ensure its societal relevance in the 21st century.\nResearch is accumulating on myriad inequities that influence careers of academic women.

Thus, evidence-based policies that can increase the percentage of women recruited and selected for academic positions 14 include the following:\nEquity advisors: Respected senior faculty committed to equity should be appointed as equity advisors and given protected time to improve and monitor equity efforts. Equity advisors can be directly involved in hiring, advancement, pay equity, cultural issues, and award nominations. They can also review job listings and interview questions for biased language, provide workshops to support faculty and trainees, and report to leadership on practices that help or hinder the equity mission. 27 Job advertisements: State prominently that candidates from diverse sex, racial/ethnic backgrounds, creed, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, marital status, national origin, political opinions or affiliations will be interviewed, using strong language to emphasize institutional commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

For example, gender-neutral policies to grant tenure extensions after childbirth or adoption led to a 19% rise in the probability that a male economist would earn tenure at his first job, while women's chances of gaining tenure fell by 22%. 59 Given that before the arrival of tenure extension, <30% of all faculty in economics gained tenure at their first job, the magnitude of this decline for women is especially alarming. 59 The broader issue herein is that an employment policy that is gender neutral on paper may not be gender neutral in practice. In the case of tenure extension, women receive this parental benefit typically coinciding with the challenges of pregnancy, childbirth, recovery, and breastfeeding, while men do not directly experience these physical aspects, but receive the same or similar benefits at some institutions.

Stanford's Clayman Institute for Gender Research asked academics with an academic partner which career was primary. Of the men, 50% said theirs, 45% said both, and 5% said the partner's 57 ; of the women, only 20% said theirs, 59% said both, and 21% said the partner's.

Essentially, society places a higher burden on women for childcare and domestic labor, and then punishes them in the workplace for bearing that burden.

Women face a gauntlet of chutes out of academia and advancement, which institutions must systematically address through policy changes. This call to action provides specific steps and resources (Table 1) for promoting an academic culture of respect and equal opportunity for all and for cultivating the inclusive learning environments necessary to empower students as future leaders. 20 The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against applicants or employees based on a variety of factors, including one's sex (including pregnancy status, gender identity, and sexual orientation), race/ethnicity, and age, and apply to all types of work situations, including hiring, firing, promotions, harassment, training, wages, and benefits. Thus, there is a regulatory obligation for enacting policies and practices that do not perpetuate sexism and discrimination. Recommendations gleaned from our review to meet these obligations are concrete and actionable. Moreover, the data we present can be used to appeal to state legislators, whose influence over funding allocations can significantly impact an institution's ability to implement some of the recommended changes. More research is needed, however, to identify methods for change when resistance is encountered.\nLimitations of this review include a focus on heteronormative binary gender norms primarily within the United States. As noted earlier, people of color and LBGTQ+ individuals experience similar barriers, in even more pronounced ways, and deserve additional discussion. 99 This is a critical issue as non-Hispanic white women and women of color, and those from other marginalized groups, may be influenced differently by the same policies or actions. Thus, we recommend that institutions investigate the effects of new policies, not only by sex but also by race/ethnicity and other relevant subgroups. We also recognize other barriers to success in academia not addressed here, including but not limited to, reproductive health challenges and sexual harassment. As the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently noted, sexual harassment of women in academia can lead to women leaving these fields. 100 The report also states that ''there is no evidence to suggest that current policies, procedures, and approaches have resulted in significant reduction in sexual harassment,'' and significant changes need to be made. 100 In addition, the focus of this review was on the faculty level, thus the majority of the data presented are from the postdoctoral level and above. Components of educational training from primary school, undergraduate and graduate school likely also contribute to the leaky pipeline but were outside of the scope of this review.\nDespite ample data on barriers to success women face in academia, data supporting evidence-based solutions are limited beyond that proposed elsewhere. 24 Many solutions require research to evaluate effectiveness and possible unintended consequences, thus we recommend data collection before, during, and after implementation of recommendations.

Soon thereafter, the NIH issued a request for information from the scientific community and consulted with various stakeholders. The feedback received was considered during development of policy requiring the consideration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in NIH-funded research on vertebrate animals and humans, which went into effect for applications due on or after January 25, 2016. We identified NIH programs related to SABV and reviewed SABV-relevant scientific literature. We find that the application of SABV throughout the research process can serve as a guiding principle to improve the value of biomedical science. The NIH is engaged in ongoing efforts to develop resources to help investigators consider SABV in their research. We also provide an update on lessons learned, highlight ways that different disciplines consider SABV, and describe the opportunities for scientific discovery that applying SABV offers. We call on NIH's various stakeholders to redouble their efforts to integrate SABV throughout the biomedical research enterprise. Sex-and gender-aware investigations are critical to the conduct of rigorous and transparent science and the advancement of personalized medicine. This kind of research achieves its greatest potential when sex and gender considerations are integrated into the biomedical research enterprise in an end-to-end manner, from basic and preclinical investigations, through translational and clinical research, to improved health care delivery.", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "T he mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. As the single largest funder of biomedical research, NIH has a unique responsibility to continually examine and improve its effectiveness. By ''turning discovery into health,'' NIH fulfills its promissory note to the taxpayers who fund biomedical research. Making the most of this investment depends on a well-functioning research enterprise that continually earns the trust of scientists and laypeople alike.\nWe agree with colleagues who said, ''Science isn't science if it isn't reproducible.'' 1 NIH continues to focus on improving rigor and transparency to enhance scientific reproducibility through policy 2,3 and changes in business practices (e.g., the grant review process). NIH emphasizes that-like randomization, blinding, and other basic principlesappropriate accounting for the potential influence of sex on outcomes in preclinical research is a crucial component of rigorous experimental design. 4 The pervasive effects of sex on biological functioningand the need to consider sex for research to be reproducible and relevant for all people-warranted a separate NIH policy. Beginning January 2016, NIH has expected all applicants proposing to carry out studies in vertebrate animals and humans: (1) to factor sex as a biological variable (SABV) into research designs, analyses, and reporting or (2) to provide strong justification for single-sex investigations. 5 Additional NIH guidance describes how SABV can be considered in the various stages of research. 6 Applying SABV in biomedical research is the first step toward individualized medicine because sex profoundly influences health and disease across bodily systems and medical disciplines. [7][8][9][10] Therefore, accounting for the potential influence of sex in research design, data analyses, and reporting (e.g., disaggregating results by sex) is crucial to rigorous and transparent science. Owing to the historical focus on male research animals and cells and the ongoing underreporting of sex in preclinical research, however, science still needs to better identify the health-relevant differences between males and females across each level of biological complexity [11][12][13][14][15][16] -building a more complete and solid foundation of knowledge that makes clinical and translational studies more relevant to all people.\nSABV: Where Are We Now?\nThe SABV Policy complements and extends NIH's longstanding requirement, as per the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act, for the appropriate participation of women and underrepresented minorities in clinical studies. More than two decades after its enactment, we see that the NIH inclusion policy has been generally effective. Roughly half or more of the research participants in NIH-funded clinical studies are now women. 17,18 Nevertheless, there is ample scope for improving the extent to which scientists integrate sex (a biological variable defined genetically) and gender (a person's self-identity as expressed by choices and influenced by social, cultural, and psychological factors) into the design, analyses, and reporting of clinical research. [19][20][21] Geller et al. reviewed NIH-funded randomized controlled trial reports published in 14 leading U.S. medical journals in 2015. They found that fewer than a third of the reports analyzed data by sex, included sex in their statistical analyses, or provided an explanation for not doing so. 22 The combined proportion of studies reporting sex-based analyses or explaining why such analyses were not done was no greater than the proportions of such studies published in 2004 or 2009. 23,24 Another group of researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence recently carried out a much broader analysis of clinical studies, which were funded by NIH and other public and private entities around the world. 25 That group found significant overall underrepresentation of female participation in clinical research of diseases relative to the prevalence of those diseases among females, even in the most recent time period examined (2014-2018). The investigators observed substantial female underrepresentation for 7 of 11 disease categories, with no evidence of reduction in ''enrollment sex bias'' over time for digestive diseases, hepatitis, and chronic kidney diseases. 25 In alignment with the 21st Century Cures Act, a recent amendment 26 to NIH's inclusion policy 27 requires applicable Phase III clinical trials to report results of valid analyses by sex/gender, race, and ethnicity in Clinicaltrials.gov. In general, applicable clinical trials are those that investigate therapeutics, biologics, and devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 26 Such reporting is essential to improving health care and supporting scientists as they generate research questions, observe outcomes, and analyze data. The amended inclusion policy went into effect for all new competing grants and cooperative agreements awarded on or after December 13, 2017. The full impact of the amended policy on the reporting of research findings will not be seen until enough time has passed for the completion of large-scale clinical trials that began enrolling participants in the 2 years since the new policy went into effect.\nAlso, in alignment with the 21st Century Cures Act, the NIH implemented the Inclusion Across the Lifespan (IAL) Policy, 28 which expands the Inclusion of Children in Clinical Research Policy 29 such that it now includes individuals of all ages. The IAL Policy also requires that the age of enrollment of each participant in clinical research be collected and reported. This policy went into effect for all grant applications with due dates on or after January 25, 2019, as well as all solicitations for Research and Development contracts issued on or after that date. 28 The NIH is also enhancing the transparency and accountability with which it monitors the inclusion of participants in clinical research by sex/gender, race, and ethnicity. In response to the Government Accountability Office's recommendations, 30 and as part of 21st Century Cures Act implementation, NIH recently began providing its inclusion data on sex/gender, race, and ethnicity in a format that is disaggregated by Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) categories. The inclusion data may be viewed and downloaded on the new NIH RCDC Inclusion Statistics Report webpage. 31 The ability to analyze NIH investments more granularly is helping to ensure that women are appropriately involved in clinical research in each research, condition, and disease category, including categories of particular concern historically (e.g., clinical trials in certain areas of cardiology, 32 among others).", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "NIH Efforts on Multiple Fronts", "text": "The consideration of both sexes of animals and cells in preclinical research had generally not advanced at the same pace as the inclusion of women in clinical studies. In this context, NIH promulgated its SABV Policy as part of the fabric of advancing rigorous research and achieving optimal stewardship of taxpayer investments.\nA little over 5 years ago, NIH first announced intentions to address insufficient consideration of SABV, described the rationale for policy development, and outlined steps of a multidimensional approach to implementation. 33 Soon thereafter, the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) began soliciting feedback on the concept from NIH stakeholders and the broader scientific community, beginning with a request for information on the consideration of SABV, released in September 2014. 34 The same month, ORWH established the Trans-NIH SABV Working Group, which was then co-chaired by the Director of ORWH and the Director of the NIH Office of Extramural Research and composed of senior staff of the NIH Institutes and Center (ICs) who are nominated by their respective IC directors. The Trans-NIH SABV Working Group was formed to support and inform development and implementation of the SABV Policy.\nMoreover, in October 2014, ORWH convened a Methods and Techniques workshop that brought together key stakeholders to discuss methods, experimental design considerations, and statistical approaches to include male and female animals, cells, and tissues in preclinical research, analyze sex influences on outcomes, and consider gender as an additional influence on health and disease. One outcome of that SABV PROGRESS REPORT 859\nworkshop was an article published by Miller et al., which includes case studies demonstrating exemplar strategies for applying SABV to preclinical investigations. 35 Based on all the feedback received from NIH stakeholders and the broader scientific community through the aforementioned activities, ORWH has taken action on several fronts to advance the consideration of sex and gender in biomedical research. For example, ORWH and the FDA have jointly supported the training of scientists across the biomedical research continuum with a series of online courses and resources on the biological basis of sex-and gender-related differences and their influences on health and disease. These courses have had good uptake and positive impact on a large number of participants. 36 The newest educational resource from ORWH and FDA's Office of Women's Health is called Bench-to-Bedside: Integrating Sex and Gender to Improve Human Health, 37 which is scheduled for release in 2020. This course contains modules that incorporate the application of SABV to various clinical topic areas, such as immunology, cardiovascular medicine, and pulmonology. The goal of this interprofessional educational course is for learners, including clinician researchers from various disciplines, to gain an understanding of the influences of sex and gender on health and disease that they can apply when conducting research and interpreting and applying evidence for clinical practice.\nIn addition, ORWH and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences have collaborated on the SABV Primer 37 to highlight the importance of considering SABV in preclinical research as well as across the entire biomedical research spectrum. The SABV Primer consists of four interactive modules titled: SABV and the Health of Women and Men; SABV and Experimental Design; SABV and Analyses; and SABV and Research Reporting. Also scheduled for release in 2020, this resource will help biomedical researchers, including academics and students, with the incorporation of SABV into the design of research studies, the preparation of NIH grant applications, and the education of the next generation of investigators.\nRecognizing that a catalyst was needed to stimulate research considering sex and gender influences, ORWH launched the Sex/Gender Administrative Supplement program in 2013. Under this program, investigators with ongoing NIHfunded grants could apply for an Administrative Supplement to explore sex and gender influences within the scientific scope of their original award.\nIn 2014, the Common Fund, which is part of the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and supports some of the most innovative and integrative biomedical research funded by NIH, also adopted the Sex/Gender Administrative Supplement paradigm. Subsequently, ORWH and the Common Fund collaborated to convene the Sex As a Biological Variable Workshop in October 2017, at which NIH grantees from a variety of disciplines shared the approaches they had used to consider SABV in 16  To enhance implementation of the SABV Policy, NIH has also made changes to its forms and processes and updated its guidance to applicants and peer reviewers. 38 There is no onesize-fits-all approach to evaluating science for SABV integration. NIH peer review guidance encourages assessment in the context of current knowledge of sex and gender influences in a given proposal's field of study, as well as in light of available methods and other relevant considerations.\nA survey of NIH standing study section and special emphasis panel members, conducted independently by concerned members of the scientific community, found that a majority (54% and 58% in 2016 and 2017, respectively) thought the SABV Policy would improve rigor and reproducibility. 39 Respondents also thought that the proportion of grants appropriately addressing the SABV Policy had increased over time. Although a majority of respondents (55% and 61%, respectively) indicated that the consideration of SABV was consistently factored into the reviewers' scoring of applicants' ''approaches,'' open-ended comments revealed a variety of views on this aspect of the grant review process. 39 Further study is warranted to evaluate the uptake of the SABV Policy, which could help guide efforts to further enhance policy implementation.\nThe integration of SABV into biomedical research cannot rely solely on NIH policy, but also depends on a critical group of stakeholders-editors of biomedical journals, who are key gatekeepers of scientific knowledge. Editors of science journals have traditionally overlooked the consideration of sex and gender in selecting articles. Yet, one international standard-the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines-promotes systematic reporting of sex and gender across biomedical research disciplines and helps authors and editors determine whether articles have appropriately considered these variables. 40 Several journals have adopted SAGER guidelines or similar guidelines 41,42 for reporting the sex of research animals and of cells cultured from animals in scientific publications. 15,43 Some journals have been more proactive on the consideration of SABV by encouraging submissions that include meaningful statistical comparisons between sexes 44 860 ARNEGARD ET AL.\nor requiring sex to be included in experimental design and analyses, whenever doing so is relevant to the scientific question being addressed. 45 Despite these laudable steps by certain journals, more work remains to be done by the science publishing industry, in general, to set higher expectations for the consideration of sex and gender in the conduct and reporting of biomedical research.\nApplication of SABV to the Science ORWH created and chairs the NIH Scientific Interest Group (SIG) on Sex and Gender in Health and Disease (SGHD). This SIG aims to expand the understanding of NIH intramural scientists as well as researchers in the extramural scientific community about the range of ways that SABV applies across scientific disciplines. The SGHD SIG promotes the dissemination of research on sex and gender influences in health and disease, and it fosters potential interdisciplinary collaborations on these topics by bringing together interested scientists.\nNIH ICs have also undertaken initiatives to underscore the importance of sex-and gender-based research and disseminate the results of such research. In July 2017, for example, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) convened a 2-day workshop, titled Sex and the Kidneys: Sex Differences in Renal Disease. The workshop highlighted NIDDK's application of SABV to renal research. In addition, the workshop afforded the research community an opportunity to come together to share information about the role of sex in renal disease risk and etiology, the action of sex steroids on renal tissues, and the role of sex chromosomes in renal disease pathophysiology.\nNIH ICs take a flexible approach to integrating sex and gender into biomedical research based on their disciplines' unique considerations and research methodologies, as well as the health conditions within their purviews. The Director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism coauthored a review article on ways that addiction researchers can consider and investigate sex differences in preclinical animal models-offering a standard for the identification of such models and the transparent reporting of their limitations. 46 The National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program examines various potential medications for their ability to extend lifespan and delay disease in male and female mice. Advances arising from this program illustrate how integrating SABV into preclinical research apprises investigators about the applicability of results across sexes and the existence of potential sex influences on research outcomes. Results informed in this manner comprise a valuable preclinical foundation of knowledge for the design and conduct of clinical investigations that are critical to bolstering the development of effective medications and confirming their safety for everyone. For example, researchers have found that 17-a estradiol and the antidiabetic drug, acarbose, each extend lifespan and improve glucose tolerance in male mice, but not female mice, and that alterations in the relevant metabolic pathways occurred in opposite directions in males and females, an effect that is influenced by gonadal hormones. 47 Trans-NIH research initiatives are also capitalizing on the power of SABV. In the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), which is a major source of funding for the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), researchers who applied SABV to analyses of knockout mouse strains, with a single gene deletion each, have opened new opportunities to improve the precision of animal models. One group of IMPC researchers found that 10% of all categorical traits and 57% of all continuously distributed traits in wildtype mice were significantly influenced by sex. 9 These sex influences were found to be distributed across a wide spectrum of traits and research fields. Of the traits with a significant genotype effect, 13% and 18% of categorical and continuous phenotypes, respectively, were classified as sexually dimorphic. 9 Focusing on metabolic phenotypes in over 2000 knockout mouse strains, another group of IMPC researchers found that there are pronounced sex differences in many genes and pathways associated with metabolic traits. 48 The researchers also found that some genes from different metabolic pathways cause comparable metabolic phenotypes in females and males. 48 Through its Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, NIH has invested in the establishment of a data resource and tissue bank to build knowledge about the relationships between genetic variants and gene expression among different tissues and in different groups of people (e.g., males vs. females). The GTEx project is advancing our understanding of gene regulation mechanisms and how perturbations in gene expression relate to human diseases, which is foundational information for personalized medicine.\nUsing GTEx data, one group of researchers quantified large numbers of genes with sex-differential expression in tissues common to males and females, with the highest numbers of such genes found in breast mammary gland, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, skin, brain anterior cingulate cortex, and heart left ventricle. 8 Another group of GTEx researchers found that most autosomal genes with tissuespecific sex differences (TSSDs) showed discordant directions of sex differences across tissues, whereas genes with TSSDs on the X chromosome were more often concordant in terms of the direction of sex differences across tissues (i.e., consistently higher expression in one sex across many tissues). 49 NIH is trying to accelerate the integration of SABV into standard scientific practice as part of its efforts to achieve optimal stewardship of taxpayer investments throughout the research enterprise. Incorporating SABV into a research program or discipline pays dividends by advancing our understanding of how sex affects biology, health, and disease, as well as by spurring opportunities for improved medical practice.\nResearch from the SCOR/E program illustrates how applying SABV can result in new discoveries that are highly relevant to human health. A previously funded Center identified how maternal stress during pregnancy disrupts the placenta-transmitting adverse maternal experiences and environments to offspring and altering fetal brain development in a sex-dependent manner-and how this contributes to males' vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders. 50,51 The investigators have used insights from basic research that applied SABV to develop a phenotypically relevant mouse model that researchers can use to study male sensitivity to insults in utero as well as female neurodevelopmental resilience, 52 with the promise of achieving a better understanding SABV PROGRESS REPORT of the origins of sex biases in the prevalence and presentation of psychiatric disorders.", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SABV: A Guiding Principle for Addressing Biomedical Research Challenges", "text": "Using SABV as a guiding principle throughout the research continuum can help address key issues affecting the biomedical research enterprise, including (1) the need to identify animal models that better reflect human diseases 46,53,54 ; (2) concerns about the increased risk of adverse events or reduced treatment effectiveness in women 55,56 ; and\n(3) the importance of developing diagnostic tests and criteria that are sex and gender aware, 57,58 among other issues. Addressing these challenges offers opportunities to improve biomedical research and lays the foundation for high-quality and safe medical care for everyone.\nAs we see it, clinical and translational research do not have a solid foundation unless SABV is applied seamlessly across all phases of research, including basic and preclinical studies. NIH's vision is for each stage of research to inform the subsequent ones about the influences of sex and gender, thereby improving scientific rigor, transparency, and return on taxpayer investments.\nIn working with animal models, for example, researchers studying the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes have applied SABV to reveal multiple, crucial discoveries about sex differences in this condition. This work has described the role of testosterone in diabetes and metabolic health 59 and identified estrogen as a protective factor in type 2 diabetes. 60,61 Furthermore, the higher risk of adverse drug events among women can be considered in the context of females' historical underrepresentation in clinical research. Of the 10 medications withdrawn from the U.S. market between 1997 and 2000, eight posed greater health risks for women than men. 62 An analysis of materials submitted to the FDA in support of marketing applications for 36 drug approvals for cardiovascular disease (CVD) between 2005 and 2015 found that the mean proportion of women enrolled in these trials was 46%, but the overall range was wide (22%-81%). 63 Women were appropriately represented in clinical trials for some CVDs (e.g., atrial fibrillation and hypertension), but not others (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, and acute coronary syndrome). 63 Integrating SABV into basic and preclinical research to identify potential differences in drug safety is far more efficient than discovering them during clinical trials or in postmarketing surveillance. Investments in preclinical research that consider SABV may also help avoid differential effectiveness outcomes-for example, poorer treatment outcomes among women for disulfiram, an FDA-approved medication for alcohol abuse that has been tested as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine abuse. 64 How Do We Get There?\nA year ago, the NIH released Advancing Science for the Health of Women: The 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research. 65 The strategic plan incorporates the missions of the ICs with ORWH's mission to chart a course toward NIH's vision: Imagine a world in which the biomedical research enterprise thoroughly integrates sex and gender influences; every woman receives evidence-based disease prevention and treatment tailored to her own needs, circumstances, and goals; and women in science careers reach their full potential. 65 To complement its other efforts to incorporate SABV into the biomedical research enterprise, NIH recently released a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) titled The Intersection of Sex and Gender Influences on Health and Disease for research project grant (R01) applications. 66 This FOA is NIH's first investigator-initiated R01 on the influence and intersection of SGHD. The FOA encourages research across many scientific disciplines. Proposed investigations must include both sex-and gender-related variables and also address at least one of the five objectives from Strategic Goal 1 of the 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research, which is to advance rigorous research that is relevant to the health of women. The first year's applications were just received. Future application due dates are November 25, 2020, and November 26, 2021.\nThe integration of sex and gender considerations throughout the research enterprise and the health care advancements fueled by that enterprise require broad involvement in and end-to-end stewardship of this endeavor. We call on all NIH ICs and the NIH's partners to advance application of SABV to all areas of science, as appropriate, by adding sessions at meetings, through focused attention in FOAs as scientifically relevant, and in training the next generation of researchers. Individuals who lead other funding organizations and oversee the governance of research and clinical enterprises, those who head up regulatory agencies, and editors of peerreviewed journals also should incorporate the consideration of SABV into their organizations' roles in the biomedical research enterprise.\nScientists themselves-whether working in academia, medicine, industry, or scientific associations and societieshave an important responsibility to champion the integration of SABV throughout biomedical research. Patients also have a role to play in asking their health care providers how well diagnostic tests and treatments work in people like themselves, thereby driving the demand for sex-and gender-based medicine. Only by making systematic attention to sex and gender part of business as usual can we advance the NIH mission of turning discovery into health for both women and men.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Funding Information", "text": "No funding has been received for this article.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Science isn't science if it isn't reproducible", "journal": "Am J Pathol", "year": "2015", "authors": "K A Roth; A E Cox"}, {"title": "NOT-OD-15-103: Enhancing Reproducibility through Rigor and Transparency", "journal": "National Institutes of Health", "year": "2015-01-10", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Implementing Rigor and Transparency in NIH & AHRQ Research Grant Applications", "journal": "National Institutes of Health", "year": "2015-01-10", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Policy: NIH plans to enhance reproducibility", "journal": "Nature", "year": "2014", "authors": "F S Collins; L A Tabak"}, {"title": "NOT-OD-15-102: Consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable in NIH-funded Research", "journal": "National Institutes of Health", "year": "2015-01-10", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable in NIH-funded Research (additional guidance for NOT-OD-15-102)", "journal": "", "year": "2015-01-10", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Sex differences in physiology", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "2016", "authors": "G N Neigh; M M Mitzelfelt"}, {"title": "The landscape of sexdifferential transcriptome and its consequent selection in human adults", "journal": "BMC Biol", "year": "2017", "authors": "M Gershoni; S Pietrokovski"}, {"title": "Prevalence of sexual dimorphism in mammalian phenotypic traits", "journal": "Nat Commun", "year": "2017", "authors": "N A Karp; J Mason; A L Beaudet"}, {"title": "Population-wide analysis of differences in disease progression patterns in men and women", "journal": "Nat Commun", "year": "2019", "authors": "D Westergaard; P Moseley; Hemmingsen S\u00f8rup; F K Baldi; P Brunak; S "}, {"title": "Sex bias in neuroscience and biomedical research", "journal": "Neurosci Biobehav Rev", "year": "2011", "authors": "A K Beery; I Zucker"}, {"title": "Reporting of sex as a variable in cardiovascular studies using cultured cells", "journal": "Biol Sex Differ", "year": "2011", "authors": "K E Taylor; C Vallejo-Giraldo; N S Schaible; R Zakeri; V M Miller"}, {"title": "Do you know the sex of your cells?", "journal": "Am J Physiol Cell Physiol", "year": "2014", "authors": "K Shah; C E Mccormack; N A Bradbury"}, {"title": "Sex bias exists in basic science and translational surgical research", "journal": "Surgery", "year": "2014", "authors": "D Y Yoon; N A Mansukhani; V C Stubbs; I B Helenowski; T K Woodruff; M R Kibbe"}, {"title": "Sex reporting in preclinical microbiological and immunological research", "journal": "MBio", "year": "2017", "authors": "T Potluri; K Engle; A L Fink; L G Vom Steeg; S L Klein"}, {"title": "Problems and progress regarding sex bias and omission in neuroscience research", "journal": "", "year": "2017", "authors": "T R Will; S B Proa\u00f1o; A M Thomas"}, {"title": "", "journal": "National Institutes of Health Advisory Committee on Research on Women's Health.

As governments react with swift and severe measures in their ongoing fight to control the pandemic's spread, it is important to understand how these actions may disproportionately increase the risks for women both directly and indirectly with regard to sex and gender.\nPregnant women are often among the most vulnerable groups during public health emergencies. In some cases, pregnant women face increased biological susceptibility to adverse health outcomes, as in the case of some respiratory infections. With other emergent coronaviruses, such as those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), pregnant women who became infected were found to be more likely than nonpregnant women to experience severe complications. 2 It is still too early to tell whether this will be the case with COVID-19.\nIn the ongoing pandemic, other factors may have a ripple effect that put women at increased risk even if the disease itself does not. As made clear during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the consequences of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks on uninfected pregnant women can be dire. Routine prenatal care appointments, if not interrupted or discontinued, may put women at increased risk of exposure to the virus. Overwhelmed hospitals struggling to function with staff and supply shortages may not be able to provide the high quality of care that all pregnant women and their newborns deserve, let alone respond to emergency obstetric complications. Furthermore, there is also a risk that lifesaving treatments or vaccines will be denied to pregnant women over concern for fetal safety or a lack of data. 3,4 The fear of infection, concern for the well-being of friends and loved ones, uncertainty, disruption, and social isolation that have become part and parcel of daily life for many around the world will undoubtedly have profound effects on mental health on the population at large, but being pregnant during a global pandemic is likely to be even more frightening for many women. Although containment strategies, such as those that require women to deliver without a companion present, including partners and doulas, that have already been put into place in some cities in the United States, 5 or those that separate newborns from their mothers immediately after birth if the mother is infected with COVID-19 6 may be clinically important to reduce transmission, they may also have profound short-and long-term mental health implications for women. Among women who have young children, previous research in Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam found that women who experience family-related stressful life events, such as illness or death within the household and financial uncertainty, are more likely to experience episodes of severe mental distress. 7 With the ongoing need to social distance, family and community networks may struggle and pregnant and postpartum women may feel even more vulnerable and isolated over a lack of social support.\nThe adverse effects of the pandemic in relation to women's reproductive health are not limited to pregnancy or motherhood. As movement restrictions are put into place, supply chains are disrupted, and businesses are shuttered, some women may be at increased risk of unintended pregnancy should it become difficult to obtain their regular contraceptive method or emergency contraceptives, if needed. Furthermore, some states within the United States have begun to impose restrictions on certain medical procedures that they deem to be elective, including abortion, suggesting they must be delayed until after the pandemic is over. 8 Spikes in domestic violence during times of crisis are another area of grave concern for women's health, and as governments continue to put into place more extreme measures to enforce social distancing, for some women, more time at home may mean more time spent with an abusive partner. Fewer social interactions may also mean less accountability for perpetrators and fewer opportunities for others to intervene.\nGender-related factors may also increase the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women globally. Women constitute a disproportionately high percentage of caregivers in both the formal and informal sectors. 9 A large proportion of frontline health care professionals (nurses, community health workers, health technicians, etc.) is women who face a higher risk of infection, morbidity, and death as a result of their profession. 9 At the same time, women more frequently serve as the primary caregivers within a household, which may further increase their risk of exposure. In the United States, 65% of unpaid family caregivers are estimated to be women and 80% of them care for someone aged 50 years or older. 10 Outside of their caregiving role, women are overrepresented in the informal employment sector. In low-and middle-income countries, two-thirds of women who work do so as part of the informal economy with limited access to health care for themselves and their families. 9 Containment and mitigation policies that limit women's ability to perform their duties without offering effective alternatives, such as closing of daycare facilities for their children or not providing paid sick leave, may result in unnecessary exposure to disease and increased family vulnerability.\nIt is urgent that we adopt a gender lens to study the pandemic and its effects, including the policies and actions that are put into place at the global, country, and local levels. This may be especially important in disadvantaged populations and resource-poor communities, where women are especially vulnerable. The public health community must ensure that existing health and social services meant to support women in the face of their unique needs do not disappear in lieu of the all-encompassing focus on stopping the pandemic. Furthermore, we argue that special attention needs to be paid to ensure that informal caregivers are supported, informed, and protected. To avoid making existing gender disparities larger as a result of the pandemic, a special body at the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is urgently needed to track sex disaggregated data and analyze policies related to COVID-19 using a gender lens.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Funding Information", "text": "No funding was received for this article.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Sex difference and smoking predisposition in patients with COVID-19", "journal": "Lancet Respir Med", "year": "2020", "authors": "H Cai"}, {"title": "2019-nCoV epidemic: What about pregnancies?", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "2020", "authors": "G Favre; L Pomar; D Musso; D Baud"}, {"title": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: What obstetricians need to know", "journal": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "year": "2020", "authors": "S A Rasmussen; J C Smulian; J A Lednicky; T S Wen; D J Jamieson"}, {"title": "Available at: https:// www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/novel-corona virus-covid-19-special-considerations-for-pregnant-women/ ?utm_source=Global+Health+NOW+Main+List Accessed", "journal": "", "year": "2020-03-17", "authors": "G Weigel"}, {"title": "Laboring alone: Some hospitals bar partners because of virus fears.

The objective was to assess associations of gender and parental status with self-reported academic productivity before (i.e., mid-January to mid-March 2020) and during the pandemic (i.e., mid-March to mid-May 2020). Materials and Methods: STEMM faculty in the United States (N = 284, 67.6% women, 57.0% with children younger than the age of 18 years living at home) completed a survey about the number of hours worked and the frequency of academic productivity activities. Results: There was no significant difference in the hours worked per week by gender (men, M [standard deviation, SD] = 45.8 [16.7], women = 43.1 [16.3]). Faculty with 0-5-year-old children reported significantly fewer work hours (33.7 [13.9]) compared to all other groups (No children = 49.2 [14.9], 6-11 years old = 48.3 [13.9], and 12-17 years old = 49.5 [13.9], p < 0.0001). Women's self-reported first/corresponding author's and coauthor's article submissions decreased significantly between the two time periods; men's productivity metrics did not change. Faculty with 0-5year-old children completed significantly fewer peer review assignments, attended fewer funding panel meetings, and submitted fewer first authors' articles during the pandemic compared to the previous period. Those with children aged 6 years or older at home or without children at home reported significant increases or stable productivity. Conclusions: Overall, significant disparities were observed in academic productivity by gender and child age during the pandemic and if confirmed by further research, should be considered by academic institutions and funding agencies when making decisions regarding funding and hiring as well as promotion and tenure.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A s of June 2020, the novel coronavirus-2019  has infected over 2 million individuals in the United States, with over 110,000 associated deaths. 1 Due to ''stay-athome'' orders from 43 states, a majority of faculty in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) were required to work from home. Given that 90% of working Americans have at least one child during their working years, 2 many STEMM faculty are without child care due to the closing of school and child care facilities and distancing from babysitters, neighbors, and extended family who might otherwise be sources of support.\nEven before the pandemic, household work and care work were not equally distributed by gender, with married women spending almost twice as much time on domestic and child care responsibilities compared to men. 3 Even among highachieving STEMM faculty, women carry a disproportionate load of household and child care duties. 4 With school and child care closures, many STEMM faculty are required to manage their laboratories (including transitioning research using remote methodologies), transfer courses to online platforms, and continue academic productivity, while simultaneously caring for and homeschooling their children. Productivity in academia is often characterized by submitting grants and articles, key currencies for success in academia, as well as other activities that build national prestige, such as peer review and serving on funding panels, which are essential for promotion and tenure. Without child care available, it could become challenging for STEMM faculty to continue typical levels of academic productivity. 5 This may have consequences for retention of STEMM faculty, as children have been identified as one reason people leave the STEMM fields. One study documented that 43% of women and 23% of men left full-time STEMM employment after having their first child, rates that are significantly higher than in faculty without children. 6 COVID-19 and the ramifications of school/child care closures have the potential to magnify gender differences in home and child care.\nGender inequities have already long been observed in STEMM fields, [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] but may be particularly acute during the COVID-19 pandemic. A virtual ethnographic study in Italian working mothers in COVID-19 lockdown suggests that women are performing the majority of household and care duties. 11 Pandemic-related productivity differences by gender are slowly emerging, with women submitting fewer preprints compared to men 12,13 and appearing to constitute a lower proportion of first authors of medical research on COVID itself than expected. 14 Taken together, the existing gender inequities in STEMM and challenges resulting from lack of child care options during COVID-19 may compound and directly impact academic productivity, with long-term ramifications in retention, promotion, and tenure of women and parents following the pandemic. Research characterizing the effects of COVID-19 on measures of academic productivity by gender and child age is necessary to highlight potential unintended consequences of ''stay-at-home'' orders and inform institutional policies and procedures following COVID-19, which could support gender equity and equity associated with other demographic characteristics (e.g., race) and expand efforts to retain a diverse workforce. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the relationships between gender and child age on self-reported academic productivity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We designed the survey after reviewing the relevant literature and tenure and promotion metrics from universities and colleges in the United States to identify cited indices of productivity and academic success. Respondents were recruited using snowball sampling through emails to likely eligible individuals both within and outside of the authors' institutions, postings to department and university listservs, and social media postings on the personal Facebook and Twitter pages of the authors as well as Facebook groups for faculty. The study was determined to be exempt by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center's Institutional Review Board, and respondents provided informed consent.\nThe survey assessed demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race, ethnicity, age, marital status, and age of youngest child living at home) and the nature of current faculty position (i.e., tenure status, rank, full-time/part-time status, and field of study). In addition, faculty reported the number of hours they had worked in the mid-March to mid-May period (i.e., the first 2 months of the ''stay-at-home'' orders). Furthermore, we inquired about the number of times they had done the following tasks during the prepandemic period of mid-January to mid-March 2020 (i.e., the 2 months before ''stay-at-home'' orders) and during the pandemic period of mid-March to mid-May 2020: (i) serve as a peer reviewer on a journal article; (ii) serve on a review panel for funding; (iii) submit a new article as first/corresponding author (not counting resubmitting the same article to a different journal); (iv) submit a new article as senior author (i.e., indicated as second or last author depending on the field); (v) submit a new article as coauthor (not in the first or senior author position); and (vi) submit or resubmit a research grant. Finally, among faculty with children younger than 18 years of age at home, we assessed primary form of child care utilized (i.e., provided by a child care center, relative, partner, babysitter, or self-provided child care) for the period from mid-March to mid-May; respondents answered the question, ''What has been your main form of child care in the past two months?'' We also assessed the proportion of child care (measured as a percent of time; 0%-100%) that the respondents were providing themselves; respondents answered the question, ''In the past two months, what proportion of the child care have you been providing?''\nWe examined overall productivity changes between the prepandemic period and pandemic period and compared respondents in productivity metrics by gender and by the age category of their youngest child living at home (younger than 18 years of age). We categorized the age of the youngest child into three categories, each spanning 6 years: (0-5 years old [i.e., ''preschool'' children], 6-11 years old [primary school aged children], and 12-17 years old [middle/junior or high school-aged children]).

Almost 6 out of 10 faculty had children younger than the age of 18 years at home. Reported changes in productivity before and during the first 2 months of the pandemic reflect that women may be submitting significantly fewer first/corresponding and coauthor's articles, but no other differences by gender were observed. Significant decreases in various productivity metrics were reported for individuals with children younger than the age of 6 years at home; meanwhile, those with children of 6 years or older at home or without children younger than the age of 18 years at home reported significant increases or stable productivity. Thus, women reported a significant decrease in one aspect of productivity (i.e., article submissions) during the pandemic, whereas having very young children may be a salient risk for decreased productivity across multiple domains during the pandemic.\nOverall, faculty reported working an average of 44 hours per week during the ''stay-at-home'' orders. Faculty without children and those whose youngest child was aged 6 years or older reported working nearly 50 hours per week. Typical work hours for full-time faculty have previously been reported at almost 54 hours per week, 15 suggesting that all faculty may have been working slightly less than normal during the first 2 months of the pandemic. This may be due, in part, to faculty previously reporting spending *25% of their time attending conferences, workshops, and receptions, traveling, and attending meetings, 16 all activities which may   have been decreased during the pandemic. Faculty may also have been distracted by pandemic-related news, increased self-care needs without usual sources of personal assistance available, or other challenges to concentration in this unusually stressful context. We observed no differences in hours worked by gender, but we found a difference by the age of the youngest child: parents with very young children (ages 0-5) at home reported working nearly 15 fewer hours per week compared to their counterparts without children at home or those whose youngest child was at least school-aged, consistent with other recent research. 17 These findings may reflect the heightened needs of young children for constant physical supervision and attention, which can be substantial even when shared with a coparent, as was the experience reported by most of our participants.\nThe decrease in working hours among parents with very young children may explain the decreased reported productivity among this group (i.e., a statistically significant decrease in first/corresponding author's publications, peer review of articles, and a decrease in funding panel meetings attended). Parents with very young children also reported a decrease in senior-and coauthor's articles submitted and grants submitted relative to prepandemic productivity, but these results were not statistically significant. It is possible that the reduction in working hours resulted in a reduction in publishing because these activities may be perceived as optional (particularly among those who are tenured) or not timesensitive, unlike other faculty activities such as transitioning course instruction to remote technologies.\nGiven that prime reproductive years generally overlap with the early career stage of scientific careers, 4 STEMM faculty with very young children are more likely to be early stage investigators without tenure and more vulnerable to attrition from the academic pipeline. Consistent with work before COVID-19 3,4,8 and emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, 11 women in our study reported providing significantly more of the child care than men. Thus, the impact of child care responsibilities with very young children may fall disproportionately on early-career women. This highlights the need for special consideration of parents with very young children, particularly women, in job applications, grant funding, and consideration in tenure and promotion. While the National Institutes of Health have approved no-cost extensions of currently funded grants for up to 1 year and additional time to submit grant applications to account for lost time due to the pandemic, 18 the current study findings highlight the need to identify other policies and procedures that academic institutions could implement to further support early career investigators with young children with reduced productivity resulting from COVID-19. 19,20 Our data also indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may be exacerbating preexisting gender inequities in STEMM fields. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Despite a slight observed increase in first-and coauthored articles by women in recent decades, last (senior) authorship and citation of publications remain consistently lower for women, 21 with publications being perceived to be of lesser quality with women as first or senior authors compared with men. 22 In the current study, women indicated a statistically significant drop in first-and coauthor's article submissions, consistent with early estimates of COVID-19 demonstrating a downward trend among women compared to men in article submissions. [12][13][14] Publications are essential for job applications, tenure, and promotion, as well as demonstrating competence as a researcher in grant applications. Publications may be particularly important for women, since one study found that women who were applying for a postdoctoral research fellowship needed more than twice as many publications to receive the same competence score as men who applied. 23 Furthermore, a core aspect of review on federal grants is an evaluation of the investigator, who must demonstrate publishing articles in prominent journals; one study found that gender disparities in funding are attributable to less favorable assessments of women as principal investigators, not of the quality of their proposed research. 24 Women are also less likely to get their grant renewed, 25 potentially due, in part, to gender bias observed in National Institutes of Health reviews. 26 These factors put women at a significant disadvantage in achieving academic success compared with their male counterparts. Although we were unable to assess gender by age of the youngest child interactions, it is possible that reductions in productivity were compounded for women with very young children, given previous data on child care responsibilities falling primarily on faculty women pre-COVID19 4 and during COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy. 11 Strengths of this study included surveying faculty during COVID-19 ''stay-at-home'' orders and a diverse participant pool in terms of gender, age of children at home, tenure status, and rank. Limitations include insufficient sample to conduct analyses by race and ethnicity, which are likely important factors, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Black, Native American, and Hispanic populations 27 as well as inequities specific to Black, Native American, and Hispanic faculty. 28,29 Since the sample was primarily white, female, and faculty in the Health Sciences, it will be important to replicate these findings in a sample that is more diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, and area of study. In addition, the data are limited by the self-report of productivity measures and the crosssectional nature of our study, which precludes the ability to analyze temporal relationships. We are unable to calculate a formal survey response rate, and there may be some selection bias related to the recruitment approach, especially since the respondents' demographic characteristics, including gender, do not reflect the overall population of STEMM faculty; however, we did not introduce bias by articulating our hypotheses when inviting faculty. A larger study would be necessary to confirm these findings, to disentangle the relationship between gender and having young children at home, and to evaluate interactions between child age and gender in greater depth; nevertheless, the findings of the present study are compelling in that they suggest that not only are parents of young children reporting diminished productivity but also women are reporting greater proportions of child care provision compared with men, suggesting that the adverse impact of the pandemic may affect women with young children even more than men.", "n_publication_ref": 32, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "The majority of STEMM faculty in this diverse sample from the United States reported maintaining similar working hours to that of their prepandemic state, with the notable exception of parents of very young children (ages 0-5), who ACADEMIC PRODUCTIVITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC reported working *15 hours less per week than counterparts without children at home or whose youngest child was aged 6 years or older.

Unfortunately, the term has lost meaning within systems of care because of misuse and lack of context. As many disparate health outcomes remain, including higher risk of maternal mortality among Black women, a deeper understanding of the SDOH-and what forces underlie their distribution-is needed.

In the United States, unacceptably high maternal mortality persists, and our dismal ranking relative to other developed nations 1 is further marred by vast social inequities in the burden of loss. Black women, in particular, experience maternal morbidity and mortality ratios several times higher than other groups. 2 Efforts to understand this inequity have focused on individual behaviors and socioeconomic conditions, typically adopting narratives of personal responsibility and blame.\nMeanwhile, the search for biological markers of susceptibility in socially defined groups continues to perpetuate the misconception that race is a risk factor for adverse maternal health outcomes. These misguided approaches have failed to identify and remediate the fundamental causes of maternal mortality and maternal health inequities.\nMore than a decade ago, the World Health Organization launched its commission on the social determinants of health (SDOH) to foster a global movement to address the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. 3 Since that time, a large body of research continues to demonstrate the role of SDOH as significant drivers of population health inequities. Unfortunately, however, the term has lost meaning within systems of care because of misuse and lack of context, and large social gradients in health and clinical outcomes persist.\nTaking social factors into account is essential to improving both primary and secondary prevention and the treatment of acute and chronic illness because social contexts affect the delivery and outcomes of health care. How health care systems can integrate social care (i.e., services that address healthrelated social risk factors and social needs) into clinical practice and what types of infrastructure are needed to facilitate such activities are major areas in development.\nA recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 4 identified five essential activities for the integration of social needs into health care: (1) awareness, (2) adjustment, (3) assistance, (4) alignment, and ( 5) advocacy. Given the siloing of SDOH from clinical determinants, the NASEM report provides important guidance about how to address social needs in the context of health care service provision. First, awareness indicates the need for screening for SDOH, and adjustment indicates the need to tailor services to resolve the negative determinants and support the positive. Next, assistance and alignment mean both strengthening social supports and redesigning health services to meet the needs of the public. Finally, advocacy includes making use of local, state, and federal governments to support public health efforts in addressing SDOH consistent with clinical care within the context of the communities where the care is provided.\nThis approach is useful not only for understanding SDOH, but also in moving even farther upstream toward identifying the structural determinants of health: cultural norms, policies, institutions, and practices that define the distribution (or maldistribution) of SDOH. These structures and systems date back to the founding of this nation and its economy on principles of racial, class, and gender hierarchy. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] They shape the distribution of power and resources across the population, engendering health inequities along racial, class, and gender lines and intersections.\nThe purpose of this review is to describe the current state of maternal health in the United States, using Black maternal health as an exemplar to understand the path toward eradication of health inequities. We highlight emergent theoretical frameworks for broader explorations of SDOH and include the terms ''structural determinants of health'' and ''root causes of inequities'' as we assess the current understanding of this topic. We conclude by emphasizing existing policy and practice solutions to promote maternal health and advance maternal health equity.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Theoretical Considerations Specific to the U.S. Context", "text": "When considering maternal health, application of the reproductive justice framework-a framework created by women of color-provides us with some guidance for acknowledging and addressing structural determinants of health inequities. 12 Reproductive justice refers to the human right to personal bodily autonomy not to have a child, to have a child, and to raise a child in a safe and sustainable community. This framework calls for program and policy recommendations that dismantle a belief in a hierarchy of human value. 11,13 It shifts accountability from individuals to systems by acknowledging that the context of people's lives determines their health and that blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is therefore inappropriate. 14 Individuals are unlikely to be able to control directly many of the upstream determinants of health: governance, policy, and cultural or societal norms and values that shape who has access to health-promoting resources and opportunities and who does not. Beginning from this vantage point allows an understanding of why social determinants are born from structural determinants and cannot be addressed separately. In other words, no matter how empowered, knowledgeable, or willing someone is to change their behavior, they may not be able to do so because of structural determinants of health inequities.\nRecent efforts to identify root causes of maternal health inequity have highlighted how a focus on individuals and their experienced risk factors-clinical, behavioral, and even social determinants-reflect actions of the individual rather than the historical, systemic, structural, and political forces that created them. Developed by Roach in 2016, the Restoring Our Own Through Transformation (ROOTT) theoretical framework elucidates the web of causation between structural and SDOH and wellness (Fig. 1). 15 This framework identifies the social determinants of Black maternal health-education, income, neighborhood characteristics, housing, access to care, safety, and food stability-and how their availability to Black families has been dictated by the very structure of American society from the time of slavery.\nStructural racism and institutional policies and practices-Jim Crow, the GI Bill, ''redlining'' (home mortgage denial on the basis of race and government-backed disinvestment in non-White neighborhoods), mass incarceration-are historically based features of an overtly oppressive U.S. society that have endured and adapted over time and continue to shape contemporary access to health-promoting resources and opportunities necessary for optimal Black maternal and infant health outcomes.

Second, many Americans live in structured environments that produce a higher prevalence of certain unhealthy behaviors than in other developed countries (consumption of more calories per capita, higher rates of prescription and illicit drug misuse, more traffic accidents involving alcohol). Third, relative to other developed countries, the United States lags in educational attainment, and vast income inequality has resulted in a concentration of resources among a small segment of the population, with adverse implications for population health and health inequities, including maternal and infant mortality. 21,22 Fourth, Americans live in a built environment that does not encourage physical", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DETERMINANTS OF MATERNAL HEALTH INEQUITIES", "text": "activity and live in more racially segregated communities (largely a result of redlining). 23 Overlaying these features with the upward trend in maternal mortality and morbidity, 2 one may infer that diverse pregnant women may have encountered barriers to wellwoman care, which may lead them to delay getting care when they need it the most. The shortage of primary care providers (e.g., nurse midwives, obstetricians, nurses) puts diverse women at risk for the delay or omission of two essential activities during the perinatal period: seeking care at an early stage in pregnancy and building trust with providers. This risk is amplified for women who have preexisting conditions when they become pregnant or who develop comorbidities during the perinatal period. This combination of multilevel factors increases the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and reflects more fundamental causes and disinvestments, such as (1) public health departments that no longer provide direct medical care 24,25 ; (2) the shortage of obstetricians, nurse midwives, and well-women nurses in low-income communities that are predominantly racially and ethnically diverse 26 ; and (3) data collection efforts that vary across county and states lines. 24,25 ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Overview of Existing Policies and Practices to Address Structural and Social Determinants of Maternal Health", "text": "Addressing the deeply rooted causes of maternal health inequities will require multiple and sustained interventions at every level.

In addition, a systematic review of the empiric literature on the impact of parental and medical leave policies on socioeconomic and health outcomes in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries concluded that (1) reforms that have increased the duration of job-protected paid parental leave have improved women's economic outcomes; (2) access to paid parental leave around the period of childbirth appears to reduce rates of infant mortality, with breastfeeding representing one possible mechanism; and (3) more generous paid leave entitlement in countries that offer unpaid or short duration of paid leave could help families strike a balance between the competing demands of earning income and focusing on personal and family well-being. 29 ", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Health insurance coverage and scope", "text": "Ensuring access to affordable and comprehensive health care across a woman's life course is critically important to assuring optimal maternal health outcomes if and when she chooses to reproduce. Substantial new research shows significant improvements in access to health coverage for women of childbearing age achieved through the adoption of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions for expanded Medicaid eligibility to adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. 31 A review of emergent research found that states that expanded Medicaid eligibility improved the health of women of childbearing age by increasing access to preventive care; reducing adverse health outcomes before, during, and after pregnancies; and reducing incidence of maternal mortality. 31 Moreover, expansion states experienced significant reductions in Black-White disparities in adverse birth outcomes shortly after the policy went into effect 32 and a 50% reduction in infant mortality, with the greatest declines among Black/African American infants. 33 To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted Medicaid expansion under the ACA and offer lowincome women the opportunity to continue their pregnancyrelated Medicaid coverage after the 60-day postpartum period. 34 In the 14 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, women must requalify for Medicaid postpartum to stay in the program. However, many women in these states become uninsured after pregnancy-related coverage ends 60 days postpartum because their income is too high to qualify for Medicaid, even though their infants are eligible for their first year of life. Given the impact and large role of Medicaid in maternal health outcomes, financing coverage for the full year after Medicaid birth may help address the gaps that women suffer in nonexpanded states.\nToo often, women struggle in systems of care that are not designed to accommodate their needs through the fourth trimester-the 12 weeks following childbirth, during which women recover from birth and transition to nurture and care for their infants and themselves. 35 Since most maternal mortality occurs in the postpartum period, 36 it is imperative that women and their supports have the education to recognize and the ability to act on concerning or emergency symptoms following discharge to home. 28 Extending Medicaid through at least 12 months would ensure continuous access to services. Currently, fourth trimester care coverage is limited to a single visit for women who delivered vaginally and two visits for those who had a cesarean birth.\nSuch approaches as bundling care for mother and child for the first 3 months postpartum and extending parental Medicaid coverage may support integrated care for mothers and infants to address their holistic needs. This could include such resources as doulas, community health workers, and midwives to ensure comprehensive support. In most states where Black women give birth, they do not have access to nurse midwives who are well integrated into the perinatal health care system. 26,37 Moreover, to date only two states (Minnesota and Oregon) provide doula services as part of their Medicaid coverage 38 ; a third (California) has proposed a 14-county pilot program. 39 Respectful, culturally appropriate care Although health insurance coverage is an important component of ensuring access to care, health policy experts suggest that health disparities have persisted even when there have been modest improvements in access to health care. 25 Coupled with access is the necessity to deliver high-quality maternity care that acknowledges and respects the cultural experiences and contexts in which women live. ''Centering at the margins'' is an elevated approach to patient-centered care that requires providers to engage with the experience of disenfranchised groups and to acknowledge the role of society and history in influencing both their own understanding of their patient and their patient's understanding of them. 40 Infusing a focus on structural determinants of health and health inequities into medical education and clinical training (structural competency) may facilitate cross-cultural understanding of individual patients and shift the way providers recognize the social and economic forces that produce health outcomes. 41 Finally, national organizations, such as the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, are advancing perinatal health equity by promoting the uptake of ethical guidelines for perinatal care for Black women. 42 ", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Invest in communities", "text": "Stepping outside of the acute care setting, it is essential to increase investments in comprehensive community-oriented primary care for diverse women of reproductive age in a variety of settings (e.g., midwifery maternity centers, nurse practitioner practices, maternal and child clinics, and outpatient clinics of hospitals). Also important are tax incentives that build public infrastructure for diverse women of reproductive age and align with the values of taxpayers, including the provision of affordable and quality health care to all Americans. 34 This innovative strategy may include tax credits to colocate maternity services and pediatrics clinics within a primary care setting so women may seek medical care for their chronic condition at the same time they are getting their prenatal care.\nAt the state level, income/wealth inequality may be reduced by supporting higher living wages and asset-generating opportunities to buttress young, low-income families, as well as passing progressive tax systems to fund robust public education, sick leave, family leave, and child care systems. Upholding assurance and availability of comprehensive reproductive health care services for all women at both state and federal levels is important for reversing the upward trend in mortality and broadening of inequities. A recent study of state-level factors linked to maternal mortality found that both fiscal and legislative restrictions on access to family planning and reproductive health services contributed to increased incidence. 43 At the national level, a maternity health tracking system that sets national standards for data collection and the development of a unified person-centric electronic health record may help to identify areas of improvement for underperforming maternity care providers in a variety of health care settings.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Identifying the root causes of maternal mortality, remediating factors that may be contributing to its increasing incidence, and eliminating the disproportionate burden of loss among families of color is an imperative for this nation's future. The immense economic costs of maternal morbidity and mortality may justify action among those unmoved by population health promotion and equity alone. Data suggest the economic burden of maternal morbidity and mortality is billions of dollars each year. 44 Beyond the 700-900 women who suffer from pregnancy complications that result in death, an additional 60,000 women 45 suffer pregnancy-related complications that are near fatal. In particular, the cost of caring for women with preeclampsia is more than $1 billion alone, 46 and the prevailing total annual cost of maternity care exceeds $60 billion. 47 As the scientific community continues to identify the structural determinants of maternal health inequities and recommend policies to address them, improvements in equitable access to the SDOH and reduction of health inequities are likely to follow. This move to advance upstream structural solutions is critical for families to thrive. By defining the root causes of health inequities, we can move the focus of intervention away from individual blame and misguided theories of the biological basis of race and ethnicity. The shared understanding of how inequities in outcomes based upon race, class, and gender are created by policy and practice is pivotal to ending these inequities. It is an economic, social, and moral imperative that we center the experience of the communities that are the most impacted when we look for solutions, because they hold the answers to improving delivery of respectful care and ensuring reproductive health and well-being for all.
