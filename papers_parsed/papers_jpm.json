[4][5][6][7][8] Unrelieved cancer pain has serious consequences on physical, social, and spiritual func-tioning of patients. In patients with moderate or severe pain, interference with sleep, daily life activities, enjoyment of life, work ability, and social interactions have been reported. 1,6,9 Pain clinical management guidelines such as those proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Agency for Health Care Policy and Research are simple and pragmatic. 10,11 Guidelines for optimal pain control include routine assessment of pain characteristics and intensity, analgesic treatment based on the regular intake of agonist opioids combined with additional doses for the relief of breakthrough pain. When these guidelines are followed, observational studies have consistently shown that adequate pain relief can be obtained in 70% to 97% of patients with advanced cancer. [12][13][14][15][16] However, inadequate pain treatment is still the reality in almost half of patients with advanced cancer followed in various centers in the United States and France. 3,17 Objectives were to review studies on educational interventions that have been conducted to improve pain control in patients with advanced cancer, and to describe their findings with respect to participants' attitudes and knowledge, pain management, quality of life, and pain levels.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "The literature published in English was searched to identify studies on educational interventions designed to improve cancer pain control in adult patients. Computer searches were made in MEDLINE (Subject) from January 1962, in Psy-chLIT (Words Anywhere) from January 1974, and in CINAHL \u00ae (Title and Subject) from January 1982, extending to August 1999. The following search strategy was used. In the first step, four separate searches were conducted for the following key words or group of key words: (1) pain;\n(2) cancer, neoplasms or oncology; (3) intervention or program; and (4) educat (education), document (documentation), measure (measurement), inform (information), or assess (assessment). The results of these four separate searches were combined using \"and\" (thus, 1 and 2 and 3 and 4). This search strategy was retained because we did not want to exclude potentially relevant studies based exclusively on study designs (e.g., quasi-experimental, randomized trials), or outcomes (e.g., pain levels, quality of life). The search strategy was not restricted to randomized controlled trials because such studies are scarce in the field of palliative care research.\nConsidering the diversity of research methods, interventions, and outcomes assessed, a systematic review was preferred to a formal quantita-tive meta-analysis. Interventions targeting health professionals and those targeting patients were presented separately in descriptive tables. Each study was systematically reviewed by using the same structured framework consisting of the following: Intervention Setting, Study Methods, Process Assessment, and Pain Outcome Assessment (Attitudes and Knowledge, Pain Management, Pain Relief/Quality of Life). The review process was as follows. In the first step, one of us (J.L.) applied the structured framework to every study under review, and prepared a working version of the two tables. In the second step, the main author (P.A.) followed the same procedure, compared his version to the original one, and prepared a revised version of each table, which were then revised by other coauthors (E.M. and M.D.). Occasional disagreement on content were discussed and resolved by consensus.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "With this search strategy, computerized listings from MEDLINE, PsychLIT, and CINAHL \u00ae contained respectively 383, 26, and 85 articles, respectively.

Half of these articles were further excluded for various reasons, the main ones being noncancer pain interventions (n 5 8), simple narrative reports on pain control interventions (n 5 7), absence of process or outcome assessment (n 5 6), or exclusive focus on pain measurement, patient satisfaction, or prescribing practice (n 5 5). Of the 33 studies retained for the final analysis, six were randomized controlled trials.

[18][19][20][21] In 7 studies, the intervention consisted of implementing role model training programs of varying content and duration. 19,[22][23][24][25][26][27] These programs were aimed at helping physicians, nurses, or pharmacists, either on individual or team basis, to become leaders in the dissemination of cancer   pain control principles. All these studies found that role model training was effective as health professionals became actively involved in implementing targetted cancer pain control activities in their own care setting. For example, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists participating in the 1day education conference of the Wisconsin Cancer Pain Initiative had initiated numerous cancer pain projects according to the results of a survey several months later. 22 However, only 1 of these studies evaluated the impact of professionals' role model training on patients' pain management and relief. 19 In the trial by Elliot et al. 19 , 3 of 6 Minnesota communities randomly selected received an intervention consisting of a 2-day minifellowship training for opinion leader clinicians and various community outreach programs over a 15-month period. Although attitude and knowledge scores of physicians and nurses improved slightly in the three intervention communities, there was no significant improvement in patients' pain as measured by the Pain Management Index.\nFive studies have been conducted to assess the impact of a wide range of educational interventions specifically designed for nurses, from a 90minute program to an extensive 40-hour course. [28][29][30][31][32] All these studies reported an improvement in knowledge and attitudes of nurses concerning cancer pain after the educational intervention. Two studies assessed the impact of educational interventions conducted exclusively among physicians. 33,34 In a group of 99 Australian general practitioners, an educational intervention based on case vignettes was effective in improving pain management knowledge up to 6 months after the intervention. 34 In a group of 32 first-year and senior residents rotating in an oncology unit, the percentage of correct answers to a questionnaire on cancer pain management increased from 58% to 83% immediately after a series of three 30minute lectures on opioid analgesics and cancer pain management. 33 However, the percentage of correct answers had already dropped one month after the lecture series. None of these studies assessed the impact on patients' pain levels.\nIn six studies, the intervention primarily consisted of introducing cancer pain assessment tools in clinical settings. 18,20,[35][36][37][38] These studies provided inconsistent results with respect to pain management and relief. In two studies, providing oncology nurses with a pain assessment tool and a pain management flow sheet resulted in pa-tients having lower mean pain intensity scores 2 and 3 days after the baseline assessment. 36,37 The cause of the decrease in pain intensity remains undetermined because the frequency of changes in analgesic medication or administration of pain breakthrough doses was not reported. In contrast, the introduction of a detailed admission pain profile to be used by the nursing staff of an oncology unit in an American community teaching hospital was ineffective in influencing subsequent pain management interventions. 35 The lack of effect of this nursing intervention was reported to be related to the inconsistent use of the admission pain history form or the daily pain management records and to insufficient support for the staff during the pilot project. Similarly, in the study by Camp-Sorrell et al., 38 a 45-minute education class for oncology nurses was found to be unsuccessful in improving written documentation of pain intensity in medical records. In another study, the simple display of patients' pain intensity ratings at the bedside in the hospital room was shown to be ineffective in modifying the physicians' analgesic prescription pattern or in improving pain relief. 18 Making the oncologist aware of the patients' estimate of average and worst pain and satisfaction with pain relief in ambulatory oncology clinics was also found ineffective in improving prescribed pain regimens or pain management in the context of a randomized trial. 20 Except for the study by Bagley et al., 35 no process assessment that could have helped to understand why these interventions were ineffective was made.\nWe identified five studies on comprehensive pain intervention programs designed to simultaneously improve several aspects of cancer pain assessment and management. 21,[39][40][41][42] In a Canadian oncology unit, a program that included the systematic use of pain management tools and the clarification of responsibilities between nurses and physicians was reported to be effective in improving indicators of adequate pain care with opioid prescription and parenteral administration. 39 A comprehensive Pain Management Program that included numerous educational activities as well as the adoption of specific objectives to improve pain management based on the American Pain Society quality assurance standards was implemented in a large cancer center in New York. 41 One year after program onset, improvement was reported in patients' satisfaction with pain control and in nursing pain management ac-tivities, but average pain intensity among patients had not decreased. In another study, a program to improve pain management strategies of home care nurses by systematic education, and incorporation of pain management as a focus of intervention was reported to be effective in decreasing the frequency of hospital readmissions for uncontrolled pain in a clinical cancer center of western United States. 40 Two studies also demonstrated that it is possible to increase compliance with recognized standards of cancer pain management practice in hospital settings. Compliance with the six core guidelines on cancer pain control of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was improved in 7 acute care Utah hospitals according to a review of 10 cancer patient records in each hospital made 1 year after program implementation. 42 More recently, providing oncologists with algorithms designed to optimize cancer pain management succeeded in increasing adherence to best practice guidelines for the use of opioids and adjuvant analgesics. 21 Only 7 of the 25 studies presented in Table 1 included an assessment of patient's pain relief as an outcome variable. [18][19][20][21]36,37,41 A very slight improvement in various pain relief indicators was reported in all but 2 of these 7 studies. 18,41 ", "n_publication_ref": 55, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Interventions directed at patients and their family caregivers", "text": "We identified seven studies in which educational interventions targeted patients with advanced cancer, and one study focusing on family caregivers. Only two of these eight studies were randomized controlled trials. 43,44 These educational interventions varied greatly in type, content and duration. For example, in the study by Rimer et al., 45 the intervention was limited to a brief 15-minute counselling session by an oncology nurse. In contrast, in the Ferrell et al. 46 study, intervention consisted of a series of three educational home visits by a nurse who delivered audiocassette tapes, and a log book on drug use.\nImprovement in cancer patients' or family caregivers' knowledge about or attitude towards cancer pain relative to the baseline measurement was reported in the six studies where it was assessed. 43,[45][46][47][48][49] For example, in patients with prostate cancer, providing information on prostate cancer and management of cancer pain with a teleconference program was found to in-crease the percentage of correct answers to questions on cancer pain management. 49 In a pilot study among 18 outpatients with lung cancer, a coaching intervention to help patients systematically communicate the sensory components of their pain was found effective in reducing the discrepancy between patient self-report of pain and pain data (location, intensity, quality, and temporal trends) recorded by oncology nurses. 50 However, the potential impact of this reduced discrepancy on subsequent pain management and relief was not assessed. In another study, a Pain Education Program that was administered jointly to family caregivers and patients during three home visits by nurses resulted in improvement in family caregivers' attitudes and knowledge about cancer pain 1 week after the last home visit. 48 Improvement with respect to pain relief was also reported in the five studies where it was assessed. [43][44][45][46][47] For example, in the randomized study conducted by de Wit et al., 43 a Pain Education Program consisting in verbal instructions, the provision of written and audio cassette documentation delivered by nurses and tailored to the needs of the individual patient and a daily pain diary was found effective in decreasing present and average pain intensity 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the intervention. 43 Interestingly, a brief 15minute nurse counseling session provided to outpatients of a comprehensive cancer center in the United States appeared as effective as the other more comprehensive interventions presented in Table 2. 45 The authors suggested that the beneficial impact of the brief nursing counselling session might be explained by better compliance with the schedule and dosage of prescribed analgesics, as patients were less likely to report stopping their analgesics when they felt better, and less worried about tolerance and addiction to analgesics. In another small scale study among 53 elderly cancer patients, those who received a short video presentation on pain management reported less pain intensity over a 2-week period than those who did not. 44 Half of the eight studies presented in Table 2 included an assessment of patients' pain relief. [43][44][45][46] Improvement in pain relief occurred in all four studies but one, which tested the delivery of a short video presentation to elderly cancer patients. 44 Worthy of mention is the fact that an intervention consisting of a single, brief, nurse counseling session that included the delivery of", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS IN CANCER PAIN CONTROL", "text": "a pain diary 43,45 seemed as effective on pain relief as a series of three educational home visits. 46 ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Considering the importance of finding more effective ways to improve cancer pain control, this review reveals how neglected this topic is in the research community. Relatively few studies have been conducted so far, and their overall quality is quite variable. The most common studies identified in this review were observational studies based on simple pretest and posttest designs without appropriate control groups. A few are very schematic evaluation studies based on retrospective surveys of medical records. 35,38,39,4 2,50 Other important methodological limitations were also present. Although all studies were aimed at improving cancer pain control, only one-third of the 33 studies included some formal assessment of the ultimate outcome, patients' pain levels. Study interventions were also usually conducted on a relatively small number of subjects. The lack of a comparison group often hindered a strict assessment of intervention efficacy. Moreover, we have identified only six randomized controlled trials, some of which in relatively small study populations. 18,21,44 The limitations of observational medical intervention trials relative to randomized controlled designs have been well reviewed elsewhere. 51,52 Consequently, using only this systematic review to define what constitutes evidence-based cancer pain control interventions is obviously out of reach.\nNonetheless, these studies provide important information on an array of cancer pain control interventions designed to target primarily health care providers or cancer patients. Studies on pain control interventions directed at health care professionals have shown that: (1) role model training may be effective in making health care professionals strong advocates of cancer pain control in their own care setting 19,22-27 ; (2) educational interventions of various formats may be effective in improving health care professionals' knowledge of and attitudes toward cancer pain [28][29][30][31][32] ; (3) comprehensive pain intervention programs implemented in health care organizations may result in some improvement in pain management, especially with respect to the systematic documentation and monitoring of pain. 21,[39][40][41][42] However, in the two studies where impact on pain lev-els was assessed, no improvement, 41 or only a marginal improvement 21 was reported; (4) interventions promoting the systematic use of pain assessment tools by oncology nurses were followed by a slight decrease in patients' pain levels 36,37 ;\n(5) the simple display of patients' pain ratings at bedside or on outclinic records had only a slight impact on the pattern of opioid prescription and no impact on pain outcomes. 18,20 Studies on pain control interventions directed at patients have shown that educational interventions provided by nurses may be effective in improving patients' attitudes and knowledge about cancer pain management [45][46][47][48][49] ; and educational interventions centered on the importance of pain intensity monitoring using a daily pain diary seemed effective in decreasing pain levels. 43,45 In and of itself, this review does not lead to clearcut recommendations for designing optimal cancer pain control interventions that would result in a clinically significant decrease in patients' pain levels. Such recommendations can be found elsewhere. Five key quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of acute pain and cancer pain have been proposed in 1995 by the American Pain Society (53). These are: (1) recognize and treat pain promptly; (2) make information about analgesics readily available; (3) promise patients attentive analgesic care; (4) define explicit policies for use of advanced analgesic technologies; and (5) examine the process and outcome of pain management. Recognizing that education alone is inadequate to change physicians' practice, other suggestions for action include making pain \"visible,\" and giving practitioners tools for change. 54,55 In addition, principles for improving physician cancer pain education have been proposed based on a new paradigm of adult learning and physician behavior theory. 56 Two studies included in this review suggest that a promising avenue for improving cancer pain control in ambulatory settings may rely on a brief, nursing intervention targetting patients, and possibly family caregivers, in combination with the use of a daily pain diary. 43,45 These observations indirectly support the view that the undertreatment of cancer pain results not from the lack of compassion of individual clinicians, but from some kind of deficiency in the health care delivery system for cancer patients. 57 What is currently missing may be explicit mechanisms in health care delivery for ensuring prompt and timely treatment readjustments in the presence of uncontrolled pain: \"If pain is out of control, there should be a daily change in the medication until the pain is controlled.\" 58 We suggest that further progress may occur in current pain care delivery for non-hospitalized cancer patients through: (1) incorporating a systematic and valid method of documenting daily fluctuation in pain levels, using simple measures of the type recently developed, tested and validated in outpatients settings, 59,60 and (2) ensuring that diary-documented uncontrolled pain is rapidly brought to the attention of health professionals for clinical reassessment and dose adjustment, especially outside normal working hours.\nFurther research is imperative to assess how effective new strategies are in improving cancer pain control, especially in ambulatory care settings. Although difficult and costly to undertake, the highest priority should be given to the conduct of multicenter randomized controlled trials for a convincing reason. Results from a well-conducted randomized controlled trial providing a reliably unbiased estimate of intervention effect would be more likely to influence positively the pattern of cancer pain practice in the medical community. 61 In situations where randomized controlled designs cannot be used, observational studies might be an acceptable alternative. 62,63 Although the difficulty of designing and conducting trials of interventions to change professional practice is unavoidable, a recently proposed analytic framework may be useful to help choosing the best design options in a given clinical context. 64 ", "n_publication_ref": 44, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Pain in ambulatory patients with lung or colon cancer.

Yet only a minority of the dying use hospice services and a cancer diagnosis is predominant among users. 2 The differential use of hospice by cancer patients is explained by the predictable disease trajectory these patients experience in the last months of life. 3 Persons dying of cancer often lose weight and have precipitous functional decline which act as harbingers of death. The U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit was created based largely on a cancer death trajectory. Current debate has focused on how this benefit can appropriately be extended to include persons dying of other disease with potentially, quite different dying trajectories [4][5][6][7] Central to this debate is whether the dying trajectories of noncancer ill-nesses fit the expected trajectory covered by the Medicare Hospice Benefit.\nThe claim that health care ought to be organized around dying trajectories is not new. In 1968, Glaser and Strauss 8 recommended that the observed differences in dying trajectories inform the organization of health care delivery. However, the trajectory of the dying process is not based on objective on various factors from objective physiological parameters to the kinds of treatments received 9 and the psychological will to live. 10 However, despite the universal eventuality of death, little research has been done to characterize various dying trajectories, and in particular how these trajectories differ by leading causes of death.\nUsing qualitative research methods, Glaser and Strauss 8 described the trajectories common for sudden unexpected deaths as well as the lingering trajectories, which are often experienced in chronic illnesses. They noted that there were critical junctures that signify important turning points. 8 Few studies have quantitatively characterized the dying trajectory. 3,11 ,1 2 Morris and colleagues 3 found that cancer patients enrolled in hospice had a precipitous functional decline in the last 1-2 months of life. However, because patients enrolled in hospice and declined further active treatment for their disease, this trajectory may not be generaliza ble. Two studies have found a downward trajectory in the last year of life for small, geographically defined populations. Lawton and colleagues 1 2 asked bereaved family members to recall the quality of life 12 months, 3 months, and 1 month prior to death for older adults dying in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Brock and colleagues 13 performed a similar study in one Connecticut county that examined the quality of life and function at 12 months, 1 month, and the day prior to death. Each of these studies found that function and quality of life declined over the last year of life.\nTo date, no study has compared dying trajectories of decedents of the leading causes of death in the United States. Although researchers have reported the proportion of individual reporting difficulty functioning in the last year of life, 14,15 our research effort focuses on determining national estimates of rates of functional decline, for both cancer and other leading noncancer causes of death, using data from the 1993 U.S. National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS).", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Since the 1960s, the National Center for Health", "text": "Statistics has conducted representative studies of all deaths in the United States based on in-depth interviews with bereaved next of kin listed on death certificates.

The response rate was 83%.\nThe survey obtained data on nearly 1,000 items focused in 23 domains. Information regarding the onset of difficulty performing activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, eating, transferring the ability to rise from a chair or get out of bed, and using the toilet), and mobility (lifting 10 pounds, climbing stairs, walking one-quarter mile, and getting around the inside of the house) was obtained.

A composite score for evaluating the difficulties the decedent had with ADL was constructed by counting the number of items where the proxy reported difficulty (from 0-5, with 5 indicated difficulty in all ADL items examined). For each disease, we graphed the proportion of decedents who no longer functioned independently for every month prior to death. The rate of ADL impairments was adjusted for differences in age among the five causes of death.\nTo examine whether there were different patterns of decline in the five disease categories, we used a one-way analysis of variance. To examine the impact of functional decline on site of death and hospice referral, we examined the association of functional decline in the last 5 months with hospice involvement and site of death (defined as dying at home or not). This was examined using a Mantel-Hanzel test for linear trend.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "Table 1 presents the demographic data for persons who died of cancer and the leading noncancer causes of death, i.e., congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebral vascular accident (CVA), and diabetes mellitus (DM). These 3,614 deaths represent 914,335 of the 2,215,440 deaths in the United States in 1993. Demographic differences were seen among these diseases, with cancer and DM affecting a slightly younger population. Women were more likely to die of DM, CHF, or CVA. African Americans were more likely to die of DM. A spouse was more likely to be the respondent for persons who died from cancer, while children were the respondents in 34.4% to 38.1% for the four other causes of death. Cancer decedents were more likely to die at home. More than one in three (35.8%) died at home, while nearly two thirds of persons with CVA, COPD, and DM died in an acute care hospital. More persons with CHF and CVA were likely to die in a nursing home (31.2 and 27.4, respectively). Overall, 17.5% of all decedents used hospice care, although cancer decedents are most likely to have hospice involvement.\nFigure 1 depicts the rate of functional decline during the last 12 months of life after adjustment for age of the decedent. The X axis goes from 12 months prior to death on the left to the day before death on the extreme right. One year prior to death, persons dying from cancer were less functionally impaired than were other decedents at a similar point in time. Only 20% of the persons dying from cancer had any ADL impairments one year prior to death, whereas more than 40% of noncancer causes of death were already ADL impaired. The mean number of ADL impairments 12 months prior to death in noncancer causes of death varied between 1.3 and 1.6. All five diseases exhibited a functional decline that was relatively flat until the last 5 months of life. At that time, persons dying from cancer went from a mean of 1.0 to 3.0 ADL impairments, while those dying of noncancer causes increased their mean ADL impairment from 1.6 to 2.3. For each ADL and mobility items, the number of days with difficulty functioning was statistically significant (i.e., p , 0.001) for cancer compared to noncancer decedents as test by one-way analysis of variance.\nFigure 2 depicts the percentage of persons who were limited in mobility to the point that they could not transfer out of bed or chair for 12 months preceding death. Only 13.9% of cancer patients had difficulty getting out of bed or a chair 1 year prior to death. This increased from 22.2% to 63.0% in the last 5 months of life. People with noncancer diseases had higher rates of functional impairment 1 year prior to death (approximately 35% had difficulty getting out of bed or a chair), but they experienced a gradual increase in the levels of functional impairment than did cancer decedents (approximately 50% had difficulty getting out of bed during the final months of life).\nThe pattern of functional decline was associated with hospice involvement and site of death (Table 2). Among decedents with a sharp functional decline in the last 5 months of life, 29% had hospice involved in their care compared to 6.5%", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "FUNCTIONAL TRAJECTORY IN THE LAST YEAR OF LIFE", "text": "hospice involvement when there were no changes in ADL impairment (Mantel-Hanzel test of linear trend, p , 0.001).

Now as we enter a new millenium, lifespan continues to increase in the industrialized nations; yet society is increasingly faced with chronic, progressive illnesses that result in prolonged periods of disability. 18 We found that more than 40% of persons dying of DM, CHF, COPD, and CVA had existing ADL impairments 1 year prior to death. Persons dying of TENO ET AL. 460 cancer (in contrast to these noncancer decedents) were less functionally impaired 1 year prior to death and continued to be so until the last 2 months of life. As shown in Figure 1, cancer patients experienced a more precipitous decline in ADL, which started approximately 5 months prior to death. Such decline was associated with where the person died and whether hospice was involved in their terminal care.\nRecent public debate has focused on issues of access and abuse of the U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit. Many have worried that hospice provides only limited access of hospice to persons with diagnoses other than cancer, partially because it is so difficult to predict survival in this population. The National Hospice Organization has released clinical guidelines as an aid for which persons should be considered for hospice referral. 6 Attempts to validate these guidelines have raised important concerns regarding their ability to predict death. 4 This uncertainty has taken on even more importance with the Office of Inspector General's increased scrutiny of hospice patients surviving longer than 6 months as potentially fraudulent medical care. 19 Our findings have implications for both of these public policy concerns. We found hospice referral was related to the pattern of functional decline. Among those persons who lost three or more ADL dependencies in the last 5 months of life, nearly one in three utilized hospice services. The rapidity of the functional decline may serve as a cue to the physician, patient, and family that the person is dying. Additionally, the functional decline and resulting diminished quality of life may influence dying persons and their family to accept the explicit trade-off of the hospice (i.e., forgoing active treatment for increase supportive care). However, the majority of patients did not exhibit that classic rapid functional deterioration. If this is true, perhaps the recertification process for the U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit discriminates against those persons with noncancer terminal diagnoses. At each recertification period, a physician must attest to the fact that the patient has an expected 6-month prognosis. Among the evidence that Health Care Financing Administration's fiscal intermediaries look to justify this prognosis is documentation of a functional decline. If recertification is biased against patients with noncancer diagnosis, these patients could be discharged inappropriately from hospice just months or days before death.\nThe functional decline displayed in Figure 1 may have implications for physicians' ability to state a prognosis of 6 months or less. Fox and colleagues 4 found that when using a narrow window of prognostic certainty for determining whether persons with COPD, CHF, and endstage liver disease will die in the next 6 months, could severely limit their access to hospice services. 4 The functional trajectory found in these noncancer diagnoses might, in part, explain difficulties with predicting a life expectancy of 6 months, as required by the U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit. For cancer patients, many died after a decision to stop treatment based on its ineffectiveness or toxicity with progressive tumor growth and inanition resulting in death. To the contrary, this is rarely the final terminal event for persons with CHF, COPD, CVA, and DM. Rather, the final terminal event is an unpredictable event such as arrhythmia, infection, etc.\nThere are some important limitations to this study that need to be acknowledged. The National Mortality Followback Survey used proxy interviews, usually asking a close family member or friend, to report the number of days that the decedent had trouble with functioning during their lifetime. A proxy is often the only person able to report on the dying person's ability to function. Many seriously ill and dying persons are often unable to report on their ability to function in the last weeks of life. 20,21 Yet, proxies may be inaccurate in their reporting of the difficulty with functioning. Additionally, this study relies on secondary analyses of existing national data. We are limited to the questions that were asked as part of this survey. For example, questions were not asked about overall quality of life or their satisfaction with life. Finally, our analyses rely on deaths from 1993. A recent study reported decreased functional disability from 1986 to the 1993 Mortality Followback Survey among those persons age 85 and older. 14 While the level of ADL impairments decreased in this age group, more than 50% experienced two or more ADL impairments in the last year of life.\nDespite these limitations, the reported results provide the first national estimates of the dying trajectory for cancer and leading noncancer causes of death. Our findings support previous research that supports the notion of dying trajectories and that function declines in the last year of life, 8,[11][12][13] and further finds that the dying trajectory differs between cancer and the leading noncancer causes of death. Future longitudinal, cohort studies are needed to examine patterns of functional decline and quality of life for seriously ill persons further. If such studies confirm these trajectories, public debate needs to reconsider the U.S. Medicare Hospice Benefit. Is it a benefit only for those persons with precipitous functional decline and hence actively dying? Or should we increase access to include persons whose dying trajectories are characterized by prolonged functional impairment and more gradual decline in the last year of life?", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This research is supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (#037188).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Medical community still divided on Oregon's assisted suicide law", "journal": "Washington Post November", "year": "1994", "authors": "D Brown"}, {"title": "Survival of Medicare patients after enrollment in hospice programs", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "N A Christakis; J J Escarce"}, {"title": "", "journal": "N Engl J Med", "year": "1996", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Last days: A study of quality of life of terminally ill cancer patients", "journal": "J Chron Dis", "year": "1986", "authors": "J N Morris; S Suissa; S Sherwood; S M Wright; D Greer"}, {"title": "Evaluation of prognostic criteria for determining hospice eligibility in patients with advanced lung, heart, or liver disease.

[1][2][3] Legislation in all states empowers patients to designate medical power of attorney representatives, and 28 states currently authorize judges and/or health care providers to appoint surrogates for incapacitated persons who did not select one for themselves. 4 These legal policies formalize the historical practice of turning to the next of kin for decision making and have resulted in family members being selected to function as surrogates for incapacitated patients. [5][6][7][8] Recent studies have shown that most patients support these policies, want to involve family members in EOL discussions, and are comfortable allowing them to function as surrogates if the patient's decision-making capacity is lost. [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] Despite patients' extensive reliance on family member surrogates to make EOL decisions, surrogates often lack knowledge of the patient's values and preferences [16][17][18][19] and frequently provide answers about how they would respond in hypothetical EOL situations that differ from those of the patient. 17,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] Because patients normally talk infrequently and in generalities with their family members about the EOL decisions they would make, 12,18 it is not surprising that surrogates lack information they need to function well in their role.\nEfforts to improve surrogate performance require a clearer understanding of the reasons surrogates are poorly informed and why their EOL treatment preferences often do not match those of the patient. One explanation may be that patients overestimate the degree of autonomy that their surrogates want to exercise and underestimate the importance of assuring that their surrogates have the information needed to make informed choices. Another potential reason that surrogates often differ from patients in their specific EOL treatment decisions is that they may use different values when making choices for EOL care. While the body of research that has examined how patients want EOL decisions to be made for them is now substantial, no studies have examined patients and their self-designated surrogates to determine the degree to which they concur about the advance care planning process, the amount of information surrogates want, or the core values that guide EOL decision making.

In general, patients want to allow their surrogates more freedom to make decisions than surrogates desire. Surrogates were more likely to believe that the best way to prepare for decision making was through written and oral instructions from the patient. More surrogates than patients believed that it was important to discuss specific EOL issues. Such discussions may convince patients that their surrogates want and need more information than they have received. These discussions may also reassure surrogates that they may make choices that go beyond those explicitly communicated by the patient.\nA second possible strategy is for physicians to obtain patients' permission to directly discuss with surrogates the amount and kinds of information that they need to be prepared to fulfill their responsibilities as a decision-maker. Because surrogates were more likely than patients to believe that physicians should be included in discussions of EOL decision making, direct physician communication with surrogates is needed to assure that surrogates' needs are met.\nOur results also indicate that physicians should encourage patients and their surrogates to discuss two basic value conflicts that often arise in EOL choices: suffering and uncertainty. Patients were more likely than surrogates to choose to prolong life despite suffering, and patients were less concerned than their surrogates about certainty before stopping a life-sustaining treatment. Encouraging patients to discuss specific situations they consider to entail suffering may assist surrogates in understanding patients' preferences regarding prolongation of life versus ending suffering.\nFinally, our results indicate that physicians may want to recommend that advance care planning be conducted in stages whenever possible. Initially, physicians may be most helpful and supportive when they encourage discussions about more general issues, including who the patient wants to function as surrogate, how the patient and surrogate prefer to have the patient express EOL preferences (i.e., writing a formal advance directive, orally, or both), and who the patient (and surrogate) want to include in advance care planning discussions. These topics are comparatively nonthreatening and can establish a foundation for subsequent discussions.\nAt a later stage, physicians should encourage discussions between the patient and surrogate of the values guiding EOL choices and the specific choices that the patient or their surrogate may need to make. We recommend such specific discussions because the factor surrogates most frequently regarded as extremely important in making a decision to stop a life-sustaining treatment was being told by the patient that the patient would not want to live in a specific condition.

Except for lower education levels than have been reported in some other studies, the demographics of our sample closely matched those of the ESRD population nationwide, 29 and the EOL preferences of hemodialysis patients are very similar to those of patients with other chronic conditions. 31 Because we obtained very similar results in two very dissimilar regions and patient populations, our generalizability is enhanced.

Little is known about what prevents physicians from referring to hospice care and how effective hospices are in reaching out to physicians to generate referrals. Methods: In 1999, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 30 experts in hospice care across the country and made site visits to four different hospice programs. Results: The interviewees identified numerous barriers to accessing hospice care that are complex and often overlapping. Some barriers relate to physicians and other health care professionals, such as their difficulty accepting death and their lack of education in end-of-life care. Other barriers are the result of patient/family misinformation and aspects of the hospice system that limit the number and types of patients deemed appropriate for hospice care. Factors that facilitate hospice referrals (which we call enablers) are also numerous and include active efforts by hospices to educate and reach out to physicians and consumers, as well as physicians' practice styles. Conclusions: The research provided powerful validation of trends that hospice and palliative care providers in the trenches have been describing anecdotally for several years. Ultimately, this information could be used to develop a toolkit for hospices and palliative care organizations to assist them with marketing and physician outreach.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "F OR N EARLY TWO DECADES, the Medicare Hospice Benefit has provided full coverage of hospice care for terminally ill older Americans. Medicaid also covers hospice care in 43 states and more than 80% of employer-sponsored health plans provide coverage for hospice services. However, less than one third of dying patients use these services. Most Americans still die in hospital or nursing home beds rather than in their own homes using hospice care. 1 With the nation's ample supply of hospice programs-the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) estimates that there are more than 3,000-and full coverage of the services for many terminally ill patients, what stands in the way of Americans accessing hospice care?\nCertainly part of the problem is that patients and families are not aware of or do not understand hospice care. The results of an April 1999 NHPCO public opinion survey show that 80% of respondents do not know what the word \"hospice\" means and 90% are unaware that Medicare pays for hospice services. 1 Yet, more than 65% of survey participants said they like the idea of an outside organization coming in to help them provide in-home care to a dying loved one.\nPhysicians also play a significant role in educating patients about hospice and helping them gain entr\u00e9e to the hospice care system. To trigger the Medicare Hospice Benefit, a physician must certify that the patient has 6 months or less to live. In addition, the physician and the patient must agree that palliative care-as opposed to curative care-is the most appropriate kind of care based on the patient's prognosis and wishes. Both are difficult steps. Prognosticating about the course of a disease is an inexact science for physicians, especially in the case of lingering, chronic illnesses such as congestive heart failure, Alzheimer's, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Physicians often do not refer to hospice or delay referring to hospice because they maintain an optimistic view of the patient's prognosis weeks and even days before death. 2 Coming to the realization that curative care can no longer benefit a patient brings the physician and the patient face-to-face with death, which is a discomforting and awkward transition, and one that physicians often view as their own personal failure. In fact, many physicians lack the professional experience, skills, and training to recognize the need to move patients from curative to comfort care and help them make that move. 3 Over the past 5 years, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) has initiated a number of grant programs and other efforts to improve endof-life care in this country. Grantees range from hospitals and health care systems to hospices and home care providers. In grantee proposals, conferences, expert panels, and other venues, RWJF repeatedly heard from those in the field that these barriers to accessing hospice care are real and affect the overall number of referrals to hospice care and the length of stay for patients who enter hospice.\nIn 1998, RWJF initiated a $12 million national program, Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care, to help health care institutions improve the care they provide to seriously ill and dying patients. Nearly 700 applicants from around the country responded to the Call for Proposals (CFP), including numerous large and small hospices. The reviewers noticed an interesting pattern among the proposals: many hospices and, for that matter, hospital-based palliative care programs were actively and eagerly seeking ways to increase physician referrals. While some hospices were doing a better job of marketing than others, even the industry leaders appeared to have difficulty getting early referrals from physicians. The impact of late referrals on good patient care and on programs' financial viability was documented repeatedly.\nThe comments in the responses to the CFP from individuals working day-to-day in hospice care suggested a knowledge and practices gap in the industry. RWJF viewed this as an opportunity for further learning and, potentially, additional grantmaking. First, the Foundation wanted to understand existing relationships between hospices and physicians; issues around referrals to hospice; current hospice programs and practices for communicating with doctors; and physician attitudes toward hospice care. As a starting point, RWJF engaged Harris Interactive, a global Internet-based market research firm that specializes in health care research, to survey and assess the current state of hospices' efforts to reach physicians.\nPhase I of the research, which is discussed in this paper, consisted of exploratory interviews with hospice experts and information gathering through site visits to exemplary hospice programs. The overall purpose of the Phase I research was to generate an industry overview of attitudes, resources, and current best practices around building relationships with physicians. Phase II of the research consisted of the convening of an expert panel composed of individuals with extensive hospice experience, background, and knowledge to review the findings from Phase I and recommend next steps. Ultimately, RWJF hopes to use the information gathered through this research to develop a manual or \"toolbox\" of best practices to help hospices increase the effectiveness of their outreach to physicians. The toolbox would document proven ways to connect with and inform doctors and show physicians that hospice referral is clinically appropriate and ethically correct for specific patients.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "Harris Interactive and RWJF collaboratively developed a core list of hospice experts across the country. They based their selections on RWJF's long history of working in the broader field of health and health care, as well as the Foundation's more recent efforts in end-of-life care, and Harris Interactive's extensive interaction with health care industry leaders. The individuals on the core list included: (1) representatives of national and state hospice associations; (2) nationally recognized leaders in the hospice field; (3) physicians who support hospice; (4) hospice \"change makers\"; (5) insurance industry/managed care hospice advocates; and (6) hospital discharge planners. a Additional names were added to the list through recommendations from the core group of interviewees. RWJF wanted the research to include a wide spectrum of perspectives from those within and knowledgeable about hospice care. By selecting experts in policy and hands-on hospice care and individuals with national and local reputations, five of the six categories above naturally emerged. Hospice experts recommended that the survey also include hospital discharge planners because they play a significant role in funneling people toward hospice care.\nTwo professional moderators and two executive interviewers from Harris Interactive completed 30 in-depth telephone interviews during June and July 1999 using a detailed, semistructured questionnaire. b From the universe of possible questions contained in the questionnaire, interviewers customized the questions to reflect the interviewee's background and expertise. Most of the interviews were 60 to 90 minutes in length and were tape-recorded with the respondents' knowledge to facilitate analysis of the findings.\nThe research team also made site visits to four hospices with outstanding physician outreach programs (The Center for Hospice & Palliative Care in Buffalo, NY; the San Diego Hospice; Gunderson Lutheran Medical Center in LaCrosse, WI; and Hospice of the Bluegrass in Lexington, KY). The site visits provided the researchers with an in-depth look at these programs, an opportunity to ask questions about referral practices, and access to brochures, newsletters, and other materials used by these hospices in their efforts to communicate with physicians.\nThe research team transcribed the information from all 30 interviews and the four site visits and then analyzed the findings for major themes that were repeated by participants. In addition, they highlighted novel or interesting ideas that offer significant insight on hospice care.\nBased on their findings, the researchers identified factors that encourage hospice referrals (\"enablers\") and factors that discourage hospice referrals (\"barriers\"). While the research focused largely on physicians and physician referrals, the interviews also identified other factors that affect hospice referrals. These enablers and barriers are grouped into three categories: (1) physicians and other health care professionals, ( 2) patients and/or their families, and ( 3) the hospice \"system,\" which includes regulations, financing, and hospice administration.

(Hospice Association) Formal marketing to physicians-as well as establishing both formal and informal relationships with physicians-is essential for hospices to disseminate information about their services and encourage referrals. As part of this study, a health care communications expert evaluated marketing materials used by a group of hospices for physician outreach.\nWhile this expert identified particular marketing materials that communicated hospice services well, he found that generally the hospice brochures, newsletters, and other publications were not as well targeted as they could be. Hospices need some expert guidance in this area. In addition, although formal marketing approaches are needed, industry experts say they believe that establishing good relationships with physicians-by involving them in hospice programs, visiting their offices, or inviting them in for seminars or educational lunch sessions-is one of the most effective marketing tools used by hospices. We are seeing a large increase in referrals. I think some of it is because we do a lot of speaking to physicians.

We're out on the floor constantly, going from floor to floor seeing patients. And, I always felt that was one of the advantages.

(Physician) (Another) issue is what they call \"the terrible choice\"-choosing between getting curative treatment or all the support or services that you need. . . It puts the physician in a terrible dichotomy as to what to do with these families.

In addition to opioid agonist activity, methadone has been found to be a relatively potent Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. 5,6 It is a basic and lipophilic drug and is subject to considerable tissue distribution. 7 This peripheral reservoir sustains plasma concentrations during chronic treatment. 8 Methadone has relatively high lipid solubility, is highly bound to a-1-acid-glycoprotein, and is extensively metabo-lized in the liver to inactive metabolites via Ndemethylation. 9 In the United States methadone is available as methadone hydrochloride powder, which can be used for the preparation of oral, rectal, and parenteral solutions. In many countries, methadone is commercially available in these formulations. It is generally available in racemic form. In some countries such as Germany, L-methadone is available and its analgesic effect is approximately twice that of the racemic form. 10 Methadone is almost completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is generally high and considered to be about three times that of other oral opioids such as morphine, it ranges from 41% to 99%, and is usually considered to be in the region of 80%. 11,12 Oral morphine has a larger interindividual variation in bioavailability than oral methadone. 12 There is large interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of methadone. Methadone is characterized by a rapid and extensive distribution phase (half-life, 2-3 hours). This is followed by a slow elimination phase (b half-life, 15-60 hours). Elimination phase half-lives with a range of 4.2-130 hours have been reported in some individuals. 13 This extended elimination phase is of clinical importance because it may result in drug accumulation and toxicity. 14,15 Most of the drug is excreted by the fecal route and only minor amounts are eliminated in the urine. Renal elimination is influenced by urinary pH; increased renal clearance is seen below the urinary pH of 6. 4,16 There are many potential drug interactions involving methadone. Administration of amitriptyline can increase the concentration of a-1-glycoprotein, this may explain the decreased methadone clearance associated with concomitant use of amitriptyline therapy. 17 The cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is involved in the metabolism of methadone, hence drugs that interfere with this system can alter the metabolism of methadone causing either accumulation or increased inactivation with important clinical consequences. The CYP system involves several isoenzymes. The CYP 3A3/4 isoenzyme appears to be the most important with respect to methadone metabolism. 18,19 Drugs that inhibit or activate these isoenzymes have the potential to cause clinically important interactions when combined with methadone. Table 1 outlines inhibitors and activators of the CYP system that may affect the metabolism of methadone. Probable interac-tions between methadone and fluvoxamine have been reported by Bertschy et al. 23 in five patients on methadone maintenance programs. In three patients there was an increase in the methadone plasma level/dose ratio of between 40% and 100%; in the other two patients, the increase in the methadone plasma level/dose ratio was approximately 20%. In one case there were clinical manifestations of opiate withdrawal after fluvoxamine was discontinued. There is also a case report of a 28-year-old woman on a stable dose of methadone 70 mg daily and diazepam 2 mg twice daily who presented with hypoventilation and hypercapnia 3 weeks after commencing fluvoxamine. The methadone dose was reduced to 50 mg and the diazepam discontinued, resulting in a reduction of serum methadone levels and improved oxygenation. 24 A study of the effect of sertraline on methadone plasma levels in 31 patients on a methadone maintenance program showed a mean increase in methadone plasma level/dose ratio of 26% (range, 232% to 1118%) in the first 6 weeks of treatment. This increase was significantly different to that in a placebo group. 24 Inhibitors of the relevant CYP isoenzymes have the potential to increased levels of methadone with resulting sedation and respiratory depression. Drugs that activate the relevant CYP isoenzymes increase the inactivation of methadone and can result in poor pain control or the development of symptoms of withdrawal. Methadone itself can inhibit the CYP 450 system. 20,24 Methadone metabolites are capable of inhibiting the CYP 450 system more than the parent drug BRUERA AND SWEENEY 128  68 and can hence result in rising levels of methadone, this may be important in palliative medicine. 20 Although methadone is not metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, one study suggests that it could partially inhibit the system 24 and might affect the levels of drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme such as dextrometorphan, codeine, hydrocodone, secondary tricyclic antidepressants, haloperidol, phenothiazines, and b-blockers.\nIn summary, methadone undergoes extensive metabolism in the CYP 450 microsome and all agents metabolized by this system could potentially interact with this drug. More clinical research is needed to better understand these interactions, in the meantime it is advisable to limit the use of agents metabolized in the 3A4 and possibly the 2D6 isoenzymes in patients using methadone. If this is not possible, increased clinical monitoring of side effects may be required in patients receiving such agents in combination with methadone.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CLINICAL USES", "text": "The use of methadone as a maintenance treatment in the management of individuals with opioid dependence has resulted in reluctance on the part of some physicians to prescribe methadone and some patients to accept it as an analgesic agent. In addition, a number of early studies of the analgesic effects of methadone reported toxicity with respiratory depression 15,32 and reduced survival in cancer patients taking oral methadone when compared to those taking diamorphine/cocaine. 33 With better understanding of the pharmacokinetics (particularly the long half-life) of methadone it has subsequently been found to be a safe and effective alternative to other opioids when prescribed by physicians experienced in its use. [34][35][36][37] In one randomized controlled trial, Mercadante et al. 35 compared methadone to morphine for the treatment of pain in advanced cancer patients. Twenty patients were treated with oral liquid methadone and 20 patients were managed with commercially available sustained release morphine preparations, both drugs were given 2 to 3 times per day according to need. Doses of both drugs were kept as low as possible and titrated to achieve acceptable analgesia with minimal adverse effects. Pain control and side effects were similar in both groups. Opioid escalation was significantly less in those patients treated with methadone than in those treated with morphine. In addition, more stable analgesia over time was seen in patients treated with methadone.\nThe unique pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of methadone result in both clinical advantages and disadvantages over other opioids; these are summarized in Table 2. Methadone is currently used for two main indications in palliative care: as a second line agent in opioid rotation and for the treatment of opioid resistance and neuropathic pain.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Opioid rotation", "text": "Methadone has no known active metabolites. Active metabolites of other opioids such as morphine appear to be involved in the development of opioid induced neurotoxicity. 38 In addition, methadone does not tend to accumulate in patients with renal impairment as its excretion is primarily by the fecal route. These two features of methadone mean that it has the potential to be an excellent alternative in patients in whom opioid rotation is required due to opioid induced neurotoxicity (see below). Its excellent absorption by the oral and rectal route also makes it a convenient choice for many patients.\nMore than 80% of cancer patients require opioid analgesics for pain at some point before death. 39,40 With current practice, patients with cancer are receiving opioid analgesics earlier and for longer periods of time than they were 10 years ago. This is a highly desirable consequence of improved education about cancer pain. However, the use of higher doses of opioids has resulted in the identification of new side effects, probably the most problematic of these are neurotoxic side-effects (opioid induced neurotoxicity). These are most likely caused by an accumulation of active metabolites of opioids. The parent compound may also have a significant role in its development. 41 Table 3 summarizes the features of opioid induced neurotoxicity. Some of the specific features of this syndrome include excitatory side effects as opposed to the traditionally described sedative side effects of opioids. The recent finding that accumulation of active opioid metabolites occurs in patients receiving such common opioids as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl and oxycodone has prompted a number of authors to suggest that opioid rotation should be attempted in most patients who develop opioid in-duced neurotoxicity, or in whom side effects are limiting doses. [41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53] Several prospective studies, retrospective studies, and case reports have been published describing successful rotation from other opioid analgesics to methadone in patients experiencing side effects or inadequate analgesia from other opioids. 1,2,36,4 4-51 Mercadante et al. 44 in a prospective study of 52 consecutive patients with cancer pain with uncontrolled pain and/or moderate to severe opioid side effects switched opioid from oral morphine to methadone. In patients switching for uncontrolled pain, the switch resulted in a significant reduction in pain intensity. In those switching for uncontrolled pain and morphine-related adverse effects, a significant improvement was seen in pain intensity, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and drowsiness. 44 In another prospective multicenter study of 108 patients with cancer pain treated as outpatients it was found that rotation to methadone from other opioids resulted in a significant improvement in pain scores. Rotation to methadone was completed in 103 patients and it was concluded that a regime of oral methadone every 8 hours was safe and effective for the management of cancer pain. 37 A major problem encountered when rotating to methadone from another opioid is that clinical experience has found large interindividual variations in the equianalgesic ratio of methadone to other opioids. This equianalgesic dose ratio varies dramatically depending on the extent of previous exposure to opioids. 1,45 Methadone becomes relatively more powerful with increasing prior exposure to other opioids and can be up to 10 times more potent in patients given greater than 500 mg/d of morphine than in patients given less than 100 mg/d. 1 This large variation prevents the use of simple equianalgesic tables to calculate the required dose of methadone. There are three possible explanations for this observation.  1. Decreased cross-tolerance of opioid receptors: The chemical characteristics and configuration of methadone may result in a different type of binding to opioid receptors as compared to other opioids. This different manner of receptor binding could result in only a partial development of cross-tolerance to methadone. 2. NMDA receptor antagonism: Methadone has been found to be a relatively potent inhibitor of NMDA receptors. 5,6 Excitatory amino acids such as NMDA have been shown to play a major role in the development of opioid tolerance and in the opioid resistance of neuropathic pain. 5,6,52 NMDA receptor antagonists have been found to reverse opioid tolerance in animal models. 52 It is possible that methadone exerts a similar effect in reversing previously developed opioid tolerance in patients with cancer pain.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BRUERA AND SWEENEY 130", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Elimination of active metabolites: It is possible", "text": "that the increased potency of methadone may be related to the elimination of proalgesic active opioid metabolites, such as morphine-3glucuronide, normorphone or other unidentified products. 41 However, rapid changes in the concentrations of neurotoxic opioid metabolites would occur when patients are rotated not only to methadone but also to other A opioids. Such a dramatic difference in dose ratio has not been observed when patients are switched to other opioids such as hydromorphone. 47,53,54 Figure 1A shows the relationship between dose ratio and previous opioid dose for morphine and hydromorphone in 74 patients with cancer. Figure 1B shows that the relationship between equianalgesic ratios of other opioids and methadone in 103 patients was highly correlated with total opioid dose before rotation.\nThe process of switching from another opioid agonist to methadone is complex and should be attempted only by physicians who are experienced in cancer pain management. Even when methadone is administered by experienced physicians serious toxicity can occasionally occur. 14 Contrary to what would be expected with other opioids, toxicity appears to occur more frequently in patients previously exposed to high doses of opioids than in patients who have received low doses. These findings suggest that greater caution is needed when patients are switched to methadone from higher doses of other opioids. A number of strategies for rotating to methadone from other opioids have been used by various groups. Mercadante et al. 36 reported a method of rapid switching from morphine to methadone using a fixed conversion ratio of 5:1, with subsequent doses adjusted according to clinical need. Switching took place in an outpatient setting and was effective in 19 of 24 patients. More than half the patients in this study were receiving 90 mg/d of morphine or less and the mean morphine dose for all patients was 125 mg/d. The authors concluded that an appropriate system of patient monitoring was necessary because of the clinical need in some patients to change doses. A similar approach for patients with poor pain control and/or adverse effects has been used with titration of the ratios of methadone to morphine depending on morphine dose prior to the switch. Table 4 summarizes this approach to methadone rotation. Only three patients were receiving greater than 300 mg of morphine. Using this method a significant increase in the methadone dose was required to improve analgesia (average 20%) for those patients switched because of poorly controlled pain. The authors commented that caution in switching to methadone is particularly important for physicians treating patients with higher doses of morphine than were used in their study. 44 Reports on patients receiving high-dose opioids suggest that the changes to methadone should occur in an inpatient setting over 3 to 6 days.

This method of rotation to methadone is summarized in Table 5. Another method of rotation to methadone is summarized in Table 6. Patients receiving morphine equivalent daily doses of less than 100 mg have their previous opioid discontinued and are commenced on methadone 5 mg every 8 hours and 5 mg every 2 hours as needed for additional pain. Patients receiving equivalent daily doses of morphine of greater than 100 mg are switched to methadone over 3 days. This method was used in the prospective multicenter study of 108 patients previously discussed. 37 Although the above studies mainly deal with rotation from morphine to methadone identical approaches can be used for rotation of other opioids to methadone by first calculating the morphine equivalent daily dose of the opioid to be changed. 37,47 The best rotation method has not been defined. However, careful monitoring of side effects particularly sedation and cognition should take place at least once a day. Monitoring should continue for many days after successful rotation because of the possibility of late toxicity due to methadone accumulation.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Opioid-induced tolerance and neuropathic pain", "text": "Excitatory amino acids such as NMDA have been implicated in the development of neuropathic pain and the development of opioid tolerance. 5,6,52 Both neuropathic pain and opioid tolerance are independent poor prognostic indicators in patients with cancer pain. 55,56 Methadone has recently been recognized as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Hence, it is possible that methadone may be particularly effective in patients with neuropathic and opioid tolerance. This could lead to the hypothesis that equianalgesic ratios of methadone to other opioids may be different in patients who do and do not have neuropathic pain. However, in a retrospective study of 40 rotations from morphine or hydromorphone to methadone for side effects in 34 patients, 22 rotations took place in patients with neuropathic pain, 18 rotations took place in patients with nonneuropathic pain.

Pain relief may have lasted longer than 8 hours as the intensity of symptoms was not assessed between 8 and 24 hours after administration and 5 of the 6 patients did not request additional pain medication until 24 hours after the initial dose of rectal methadone.

Similar to intravenous administration the pharmacokinetics of rectal methadone showed a rapid, extensive distribution phase followed by a slow elimination phase with wide interindividual variation. 61 In a prospective study 16 cancer patients with poor pain control were rotated from high dose hydromorphone to custom made methadone suppositories every 8 hours.

In addition, subcutaneous administration of methadone is problematic because of local reactions at the injection site. A recent report outlines three patients who developed ventricular arrhythmias while on high doses of methadone (600 mg/d). In two of the cases patients had some degree of previous cardiac impairment. In all three cases drug interactions involving methadone and the CYP3A4 isoenzyme system were a possible cause. 68 Possible drug interactions involving methadone have been discussed in the section on pharmacologic aspects of methadone. Methadone has some potential advantages over other opioids in terms of side effects. With its dual effect on opioid receptors and NMDA receptors, methadone may produce tolerance less frequently than do other opioids. Another possible benefit is suggested by preliminary data which suggests that constipation may develop at much slower pace in patients receiving methadone than in those given other opioid agonists. 69,70 Future research A number of issues related to the use of methadone require further clarification through research. With its numerous advantages and the difficulties encountered in rotation to methadone from other opioids it could be an alternative first line agent in the treatment of cancer pain. In addition its extremely low cost (it is 15-20 times cheaper than other opioids 4,71 makes it an appealing drug from the perspective of developing countries. At least one international multicenter trial is planned to look at the possibility of using methadone as a first-line agent.\nThere have not been enough reported cases of opioid rotation from methadone to other opioids to either confirm or reject the assumption that the dose ratio is the same in both directions, this needs to be clarified especially if methadone is to be used as a first line agent in the future. The issue of how best to rotate to methadone in various clinical situations should also be further researched.\nStudies are needed to evaluate the role of methadone further in patients with poorly responsive pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and in those who develop rapid tolerance to other opioids.

Methods: Items were derived from focus groups and a national survey identifying attributes of the quality of dying. Fifty-four items measured on a five-point Likert scale covered six domains. We administered the instrument to equal numbers of Veteran's Administration (VA) and university medical center outpatients with advanced serious illness. We assessed psychometric properties using factor analysis. Results: Two hundred patients completed the instrument (response rate, 85%). Diagnoses included cancer (64%), congenital heart failure (CHF) (19.5%), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (10%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (6.5%). Seventy-four percent were male, 64% were caucasian, and 34% African American.

The Institute on Medicine, the American Medical Association, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, among others, have identified outcomes assessment as a high priority within the effort to advance care of the dying. [1][2][3] In short, if we want to help patients die better, we have to know what better is, and how to systematically assess it.\nMany researchers have noted this task is complex. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Dying patients and their families confront unique challenges that span a broad range of quality of care and quality-of-life issues including symptom management, support of function and autonomy, advance care planning, appropriate utilization of resources, patient and family satisfaction, global quality of life, family burden, survival time, provider continuity and skill, and bereavement. 5 Many of these components of experience are not addressed with usual health care assessment tools. In response, several researchers and clinicians have developed instruments specifically designed for the end of life, including the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Missoula-VITAS Quality of Life Index, Mc-Master Quality of Life Scale, the adapted EORTC QLQ30, the FACIT-Pal, and the SEIQoL. 7,[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Each was designed to accommodate the unique experiences of dying patients and departs from previously used quality of life instruments in several ways. Most have reduced the dominant emphasis on physical subscales and created more balanced multidimensional assessment including psychosocial and, often, spiritual or transcendent issues. As a result, most are able to document not only functional decline but accommodate the possibility of personal growth at the end of life. 11 Medicine has increasingly emphasized the importance of patient-centered care and, although some of these instruments are largely expert-derived, several measurement tools evolved from the collection of patients' perspectives; the FACIT series may be the most extensive example. Furthermore, two instruments include individually rated weights for each subscale, thereby acknowledging both between-person and withinperson differences in defining quality of life. 7,19 Another patient-centered strategy is found in the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire; rather than respond to a predetermined list of symptoms, individuals choose their most troublesome symptoms.\nHowever, each of these recent instruments was designed to assess the experiences of patients with either a specific diagnosis or stage of illness. For example, most end-of-life scales have been developed within cancer populations, whose relatively predictable disease trajectory is markedly different from the acute-episodic illness course of advanced congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 15,[19][20][21] Alhough not disease-specific, other measurement tools are designed for patients who have acknowledged the terminal nature of their illness or are receiving care in a hospice or palliative care unit. 7,11 Many dying patients never elect such care and may not identify themselves as terminally ill.\nThe purpose of this study was to create and validate an instrument to assess the quality of life of patients with a range of diseases (cancer, congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) in a variety of care settings, who may or may not have acknowledged the terminal nature of their disease, but who, nonetheless, are grappling with end-of-life issues. To this end, we sought to develop a new inductively derived assessment tool and, where appropriate, build on the strengths of earlier instruments. The development of this instrument began from the \"ground up\" with the collection of qualitative accounts from seriously ill patients, recently bereaved family members, and various health care providers regarding what is important at the end of life. 22 A national survey followed to affirm or reject those attributes. 23 In this paper, we describe the initial assessment of this new instrument designed to measure quality of life at the end of life (QUAL-E).", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design", "text": "This was a cross-sectional study to ascertain the instrument's psychometric properties and inform item reduction.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Subjects", "text": "Patients with stage IV cancer, CHF with ejection fraction of 20% or less, COPD with forced ex-STEINHAUSER ET AL. 830 piratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) of 1.0 liter or less, or dialysis-dependent ESRD were eligible for the study. To identify potential patients for initial instrument validation, we reviewed weekly rosters for the oncology, heart failure, pulmonary, and dialysis clinics at the Durham Veterans Affairs and Duke University Medical Centers. We randomly assigned a recruitment order to all eligible patients and enrolled as many patients as time allowed for each clinic half day. Written informed consent was obtained at the time of recruitment. We administered the Short Portable Mental Health Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) at the time of enrollment and excluded patients with scores less than 8 of 10. 24 We continued to recruit subjects until we accrued a total of 200 patients, a number considered sufficient for factor analysis. [25][26][27][28] The study was approved by the institutional review boards of both the VA and Duke University Medical Centers.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Instrument design", "text": "Instrument items were derived from two studies designed to identify attributes of quality at the end of life. First, we conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with seriously ill patients, recently bereaved family members, physicians and other health care providers (nurses, social workers, chaplains, and hospice volunteers) to elicit, qualitatively, attributes of a \"good death.\" 22 Subsequently, we distributed a survey to national samples of the aforementioned groups to affirm or reject those themes quantitatively. 23 A detailed description of the methods can be found elsewhere. 22,23 Analysis of focus group and survey data revealed six domains of experience at the end of life: pain and symptom management, communication about treatment decisions, preparation for death, completion, contributing to others, and being known as a whole person. As expected, both qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated the six domains were interrelated, and therefore, not in all instances, empirically distinct. For example, contributing to others may be an expression of offering a legacy and an important part of achieving a sense of completion. Being known as a whole person was most often identified in the context of physician-patient relationships. Each domain was represented by multiple items.\nSimilar to existing measures, the QUAL-E includes an assessment of patients' physical symptoms. However, previous data suggested the importance of understanding not only frequency and severity of symptoms but interference with daily life and anticipatory concern about symptom expression. We, therefore, chose a physical symptom assessment strategy built on combined techniques found in the literature and augmented by our previous studies showing patients concerns about future symptom exacerbations. 11,22,29 Patients were asked to choose up to three distressing symptoms and rate for each the frequency, severity, impact, and related future concern. We compared symptoms with overall quality of life and noted correlations among within-person symptom ratings. Because all three symptoms correlated consistently with other items, we report responses only for the first symptom.\nThe instrument completed by patients contained 54 items and was intentionally long to assess response distributions across items of similar substance but with different phrasing. For example, as part of the domain rating patients' life completion, we asked about a sense of peace. To understand religious and cultural variation and preferences we asked this question several ways including the extent to which they felt at peace with God, at peace spiritually, at peace with personal relationships, and at peace with themselves. Based on a comparison of response distributions, only one of these questions was retained for factor analysis.\nAlthough all instrument items were derived inductively from previously collected qualitative and quantitative data, there is theme overlap between some of our questions and those found in other instruments or qualitative studies. 7,11,19,20,30,31 For example, questions about peace, spending time with friends and family, saying important things to loved ones, and having one's affairs in order are found in the Missoula-VITAS Quality of Life Index. Concerns about dying are in both the Missoula-VITAS and the FACT-G. The theme of a sense of meaning is in both the Missoula-VITAS and McGill instruments, although worded differently. This commonality demonstrates a growing consensus across sources about central attributes of quality at the end of life.\nAfter each multi-item domain, patients were asked to evaluate its overall importance to their quality of life. For example, after completing ASSESSING THE QUAL-E questions about the severity, frequency, etc., of their symptoms, patients rated the importance of physical symptoms in overall quality of life. Scale items were written in a five-point Likert format. Various anchor sets were piloted for comprehension and response distribution. In the final format, respondents rated their level of agreement with each statement. The questionnaire was targeted to a sixth-grade reading level.\nThe full instrument, containing a total of 54 items and including a single item rating of overall quality of life, was pretested for readability and interpretability. The initial pretesting, conducted with 25 patients, was an iterative process in which questions were administered to five patients, revised if necessary, and administered to another five patients. This refinement continued until no additional changes were required. During this process, response categories were examined for response frequency. Items with more than 95% endorsement of any one category were rewritten to improve sensitivity. After each interview, participants were asked to give feedback on both questionnaire length and content. Our goal was to assess sensitive topics of importance to seriously ill patients without evoking undue distress. For example, some patients became teary when discussing thoughts of dying, but no participant asked that the item be removed or stopped the interview.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Instrument administration", "text": "Patients demonstrating satisfactory cognitive status on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (i.e., , 2 errors) completed both a series of demographic questions and the 54-item instrument, administered in person by a trained interviewer.

Items with more than 50% of the distribution in any one response category were marked for closer examination. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilkes test. Items not exhibiting normality were marked for further review. Domain assessment. After reviewing item descriptive statistics, we reduced the original 54 items by removing the domain importance questions, the global quality-of-life item, highly skewed items, and redundant items, such as the multiple questions regarding peace and evaluation of patients' second and third symptoms. The remaining 30 items were retained for factor analyses.\nExploratory factor analysis with an oblique-rotated Promax solution was used to group attributes into domains and reduce the number of questionnaire items. An oblique rotation allows one to evaluate the reasonableness of the orthogonality assumption and can produce a more realistic presentation of the factors. 32,33 It is the most appropriate choice given our assumption that some conceptual domains may not be empirically distinct. Eigenvalues greater than 1.0 combined with a scree plot 28 were used to determine the number of domains. The scree plot was used to identify the number of factors that extracted the maximum amount of variance from the set of indicators. 34 Items not loading (.0.50) on the expected factors were removed. We sought simple structure as an indication of variables being related to appropriate domains. 35 That is, we looked for high loadings for variables expected to relate to certain constructs and low loadings for unrelated variables and constructs.\nThe final model contained 24 items (see Table 1). Using this reduced model, we also compared items and domains in an interitem correlation matrix. If a domain is reliable, correlations among its constituent items should be high. We assessed internal consistency for individual domains and the full measure using Cronbach a. Items that did not have an item-to-domain correlation above 0.60 were marked for evaluation. 36 As noted previously, a sample size of 200 is well powered to detect such strong correlations (.0.50) among 30 items.

First, it was developed inductively using systematically collected accounts and responses of a range of participants in end-of-life care including seriously ill patients (cancerous and noncancerous advanced diseases), recently bereaved family members, physicians, and other STEINHAUSER ET AL. 834 health care providers. Second, it confirms the importance of two domains featured in existing instruments, namely physical symptoms and issues of spirituality. Third, it offers several new domains of experience including an expanded definition of life completion, the influence of interaction with the health care system, and preparation. Finally, it contains individual importance ratings that will allow the weight of individual domains to vary between individuals and within the same individual over time. The results of the preliminary validation phase suggest the QUAL-E is acceptable to seriously ill patients and exhibits excellent initial psychometric properties.\nAs noted, one of the new features of this instrument is the multifaceted nature of the first domain, completion. Other researchers have described the importance of transcendence expressed through connection with God, peace, or sense of meaning and as noted, it is present in most recent end-of-life instruments. 7,11,20,21,3 0 In the QUAL-E, these aspects were supplemented by items showing contributions to others, for example, through time together, gifts, or wisdom. In a recent palliative care study, cancer patients reported that \"feeling useful\" influenced whether their days were \"good\" versus \"bad.\" 40 Furthermore, the need to give of oneself to the well-being of others was noted by participants in our previous focus group study and confirmed in a national survey. 22,23 Interestingly, it was an attribute of quality at the end of life identified as salient to patients but less important to physicians. Experts in human development theory have long noted this need for \"generativity,\" necessary growth achieved through giving. 41 Our data suggest that transcendence may be achieved in several ways: as one moves beyond the self either religiously (connected to others before death), spiritually (beyond the body, after death), and generationally in legacy passed to children and family. Furthermore, questions of meaning ASSESSING THE QUAL-E 835 and completion accounted for the most variance in overall quality-of-life at the end of life. Physical symptoms were clearly important but accounted for less variance in overall quality-of-life among seriously ill patients. This has been noted by other researchers who have suggested usual quality-of-life instruments, with the opposite domain weightings, do not account for patients growth, particularly existential growth, at the end of life. 6,11,40,42 -47 The results from this study suggest that growth occurs, in part, through a sense of contribution.\nThe second component captured by the QUAL-E is the domain measuring patients' relationships with the health care system, specifically with regard to knowledge of illness, knowing what to expect about illness, and whether the patient felt the doctor knew him or her as a \"whole person.\" In focus group discussions, the domains of \"communicating about treatment decisions\" and \"being known as a whole person\" were most often discussed together. 22 These data suggest the two concepts are empirically linked in a domain assessing patients relationships with the health care system. The significance of these relationships at the end of life is evident in some quality of care measures, particularly the after death family interviews but less prominent in pre-death patient quality-of-life tools. 37,39 More than a measure of patient satisfaction, this domain's salience suggests that information, expectations, and the extent to which patients' believe that formal providers perceive them as \"whole persons\" are crucial components of quality in the final phase of life. In focus groups, family members recounting the deaths of a loved ones were comforted by the personal interactions they witnessed between their relatives and physicians, saying the patient received personal care not only treatment for a disease. 22 The third contribution of the QUAL-E is recognition of patients' preparation or anticipatory concerns. Worry about being a burden, financial strain, and whether or not families were prepared for the future, emerged as a coherent theme. Some existing tools measure concern about dying or financial strain, and others assess anxiety. However, items in the QUAL-E appear to measure a broader sense of preparation and anticipation, and as such, are novel. Patients' fears of their families' futures and the sense of burden they may bring was a common concern raised by patients in both focus groups and a national survey; physicians were less likely to endorse its importance. 22,23 The inclusion of \"regrets about the way I have lived my life\" may seem dissonant with a theme of the future. However, many patients anticipate their dying as a time of reckoning. Looking back, perhaps with regret, appears part of the process of preparing for the future. 22 Similar to most quality-of-life tools, responses on the QUAL-E identified a clear physical symptom domain or subscale. However, unlike other instruments, these questions combine ratings of symptom severity and frequency with impact on functioning and fear of future symptoms. Of note, fears about future symptom expression did not load highly on the preparation domain. Measurement of aspects of patients' physical symptoms beyond frequency and severity contributes new information to the multidimensional measurement of quality at life's end, and alerts clinicians not only to manage patients' current physical distress, but also allay fears related to symptoms and their expression in the future.\nItems associated with affective social support were expressed as a fifth domain, and included whether the person had a confidant and spent time with family. The importance of social support or connectedness at the end of life has been identified by other efforts to measure components of a good death. 6,7,19,37,39 ,48 Both items in the fifth domain, loaded strongly on the first domain, perhaps indicating an important link to \"completion.\" After the next phase of validation, we will examine the items' convergent and divergent validity with comparison measures to determine final factor structure.\nPreviously published quality-of-life indices tend to be divided a priori into biomedical, psychological, social, and spiritual concerns. However, these categories may reflect the divisions of research disciplines rather than distinctions spawned by patients' and families' experiences. A growing body of evidence suggests patients' and families' perspectives offer a more integrated view of death and dying. 22,[49][50][51] The alternative conceptualization presented in the QUAL-E overlaps with previous studies, but we would argue, is qualitatively and quantitatively distinct.\nThe study has several limitations. Half of the participants were recruited from a Veterans Administration (VA) medical center and the other half from a private university medical center. As a result, more than half of respondents are male.\nHowever, more than 25% were female; statistical analyses of subgroup differences based on gender, therefore, are adequately powered. Many patients had extended relationships with physicians, but these results may not be generalizable to those with longer term relationships with their physicians. All participants in the study had advanced disease but were ambulatory at the time of interview. This allowed initial assessment among a seriously ill population that was able to respond to the questionnaire. Three months after data collection with the first 100 patients 20% of that sample had died. Finally, because factor structure was analyzed using oblique rotation, multicollinearity may result if entering the full instrument in other analytic models. This will be tested empirically after the second phase of validation.\nThis was an initial validation of a new instrument. The study was primarily concerned with response distributions, and underlying factor structure. We do not report correlations with comparison measures assessing concurrent or divergent validity. Those assessments are underway in the second phase of validation using the revised shorter instrument (items in Table 1 plus the domain importance items and global quality-of-life question) on another sample of seriously ill patients. This phase also is evaluating test-retest reliability. A weighting scheme and a consequent scoring algorithm will be created after validity and reliability have been established.\nQuality-of-life at the end of life is a multidimensional construct comprising a broad array of needs and influenced by one's interpersonal relationships, as well as personal reflections of the past, perceptions of the present, and expectations of the future. Patients come to the end of life with a range of illness trajectories, the relatively predictable pattern of functional decline among patients with metastatic disease, and the erratic crises that punctuate the functioning of patients with CHF and COPD. The instrument presented in this paper was designed to capture the experiences of patients with each of these illness courses. Furthermore, our goal is to validate a tool that is useful in a variety of care settings, irrespective of self-identification as \"terminally ill.\" Future psychometric work will help understand the relative weights of domains and how they vary both between individuals and within individuals over time.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ASSESSING THE QUAL-E", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "APPENDIX", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Measuring Quality-of-Life at the End of Life (QUAL-E): Thirty-One Items", "text": "I'd like you to think back over the last month.

We regularly receive thank you notes from patients and families, had an outstanding response to our first annual memorial service, and have been recognized as one of the innovators in palliative care. 11 We studied some process indicators for care of the 38 patients compared to their controls. For in-  stance, all PCU patients had pain scores measured, compared to two thirds of non-PCU patients, and all PCU patients had chaplain visits offered compared to one third of the non-PCU patients. In all but one of the control cases, death was predictable from the admission history and physical, yet only one had a hospice discussion, and none had enrollment in hospice (the patient died while waiting for a hospice bed at a local Veterans' Administration Medical Center). There were substantial opportunities to reduce the care in nearly every case, such as stopping oxygen unless dyspnea was present (minimum $125 charge per day); stopping megestrol acetate ($12 per day for 800-mg suspension), omeprazole ($3 or more per day) or other proton pump inhibitors, intravenous fluids, etc.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Appropriate care of medically complex terminally ill patients in a high-volume, specialized unit appears to significantly lower cost. Our daily charges and costs of dying patients decreased substantially by the use of standardized procedures delivered by specialists in a high-volume setting.\nOthers have found similar results with attempts to improve end-of-life care, although no center has reported results for in-hospital end-oflife care. A randomized clinical trial of a nurse coordinator for terminally ill patients in England did not change disease outcomes but total costs were reduced from \u00a38814 to \u00a34414 for cost savings of 41%. 13,14 The savings came from decreased hospital days and a shift to outpatient care.\nThe City of Hope National Medical Center designed a three-part program to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for pain control. Pain admissions decreased from 4.4% to 3.0% with a cost savings of $1,666 per day that equaled $2,719,245. 15 It is important to change the type of care, or choose the type of care to which this model is applied, or costs may simply be shifted from one source to another with only minor net savings. [16][17][18] PALLIATIVE CARE UNIT COSTS 703 Bruera 19 implemented a Regional Palliative Care Program to increase access of terminally ill patients to palliative care, and to decrease in-hospital deaths and lengthy admissions. Deaths in acute care facilities declined from 84%-55%; the number of dying patients receiving palliative care increased from 23%-71%, and cost savings were estimated at $1,700,000 Canadian. Our group developed a the Rural Cancer Outreach Program (RCOP) between two rural hospitals and the Medical College of Virginia's (MCV) Massey Cancer Center to bring state-of-the-art cancer care to medically undeserved rural patients. 20 Improvements were noted in pain control as measured by morphine use, which increased 700% the first 2 years and has been sustained. The cost for each RCOP patient admitted to MCV decreased by more than 40%, compared to only a 2% decrease for all other cancer patients consistent with increased coordination among providers. 21 There are some obvious shortcomings to this study. First, it was not a randomized controlled trial because it was not ethical to randomize to \"best care by experts using state of the art standardized algorithms in a dedicated unit\" to regular hospital care. The rapid acceptance of the unit now prevents an in-hospital randomization. Second, at least some of the savings can be attributed to the change in goals of care. That is, once people are clearly identified as dying, much of the costly intervention is stopped. However, in our consultation we often found evidence of intensive and expensive interventions (multiple methods of pain control, expensive antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition or tube feedings, oxygen use, planned diagnostic tests such as magnetic resonance or computer tomography scans, etc.) when it was quite clear that the patient and family were accepting death. Those patients who were not transferred generally kept these interventions. The most likely reason is that the attending medical care team did not know how to change care patterns. A curriculum to teach the skills of defining goals of care and switching from active treatment to palliative care is now available. 22 Last, the costs in the rest of the hospital could be inflated, but our costs are midrange in our insurance market.\nWe addressed some of these issues with the case-control study of patients who died without the benefit of the PCU team-and showed that costs were reduced by nearly 60%. We cannot be sure that the patients in the case-control group were completely similar because this was not a randomized trial. However, we did review the charts and found no difference in demographics, disease status, predictability of death, type of intervention, etc. In addition, our PCU group for this study included the more expensive non-PCU portion of their costs, before transfer and standardization of care. Had we excluded the care and cost prior to PCU stay, the differences between the two groups would be even more striking.\nIn summary, appropriate standardized care of medically complex terminally ill patients in a high-volume, specialized unit appears to lower cost significantly. This is supported by other studies of coordinated care, regional programs, and standardization of palliative and cancer care. If these findings are confirmed by other studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, the cost savings would be significant.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We are indebted to the Thomas Hospice Foundation and many individual members for continued essential support, the excellent staff of the Thomas Palliative Care Unit, and Karen G.

In 1997, heart disease (congestive heart failure [CHF]) was the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 31.4% of all deaths, followed by cancer, representing 23.3% of deaths, with stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the third and fourth leading causes of death respectively. 1 The U.S. health care system has evolved with a primary focus on restorative/curative care directed at short-term acute illness. 2 As the patterns of morbidity and mortality have shifted toward chronic illness that is marked by episodic needs for higher levels of care and unpredictable disease trajectories, the health care delivery system has failed to provide an adequate continuum of care. 3 Death or recovery is no longer predictable. Chronically ill patients cycle through bouts of hospitalization followed by periods of home health and eventually cycle back into acute care. 4 The hospice experience attests to the problems in the care delivery system. The host of barriers to timely referrals to hospice includes physician difficulty in discussing death 5 and in prognosticating life span. 6,7 Because of the increased difficulty in predicting non-cancer deaths, such as CHF or COPD, timely hospice referrals and average length of hospice stay for those with chronic illness who would benefit from hospice care are further diminished. In a retrospective chart review conducted at the Hospice of the Visiting Nurse Association of Greater Philadelphia, the majority of patients (51%) referred to hospice died within 14 days of admission, 35% died within 7 days of hospice admission. 6 The increased costs of health care, and in particular the high costs of specialized care for the dying, have brought further attention to the need to scrutinize costs of end-of-life medical care. End-of-life care has been estimated to represents between 10% and 12% of our nations total health care costs. 8,9 On an individual basis, costs for terminal care in the last year of life average $31,000. 8 In addition to being costly, many of these supposedly life-prolonging procedures are unneces-sary and cause distress, pain, and discomfort to both the patient and the family. 10 These facts and findings provide substantial evidence supporting the need for a health care delivery system that is more reflective of the medical needs of the chronically ill. Rather than care aimed solely toward curative measures until death, a new continuum must be developed that provides a blended model of care, 11 introducing palliative measures into curative practices. This blended model of care introduces psychosocial services, symptom control, and pain relief earlier in the disease progression, diminishing curative measures and increasing palliative practices as needed in response to the disease progression and the patients' desires. To date substantive evidence for the efficacy of such new models is limited. This study sought to provide documentation of the effectiveness of a home-based palliative care model through the following research hypothesis: total medical service use during the last months of life will be less under the palliative care model than under the traditional model of care. In addition, this study sought to determine if patients enrolled in the palliative care program were more satisfied with their care compared to those receiving traditional care.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Site", "text": "This study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente (KP) TriCentral Service Area located in southern California, which has a total member enrollment of 675,000.

KP Members presenting with a life-threatening disease (pri-marily COPD, CHF, or cancer) and a prognosis of approximately 1 year or less to live are eligible for admission to the Palliative Care Program. Referrals originate from various sources including physicians, discharge planners, home health nurses, and social workers. In addition, the patient may be referred by the liaison nurses who visit patients and their families in the hospital or medical offices with the goal of evaluating and assessing potential referrals for both hospice and palliative care. Finally, patients referred to hospice but either do not meet the criteria or refuse Hospice services may be referred to the palliative care program.\nComparison group patients were obtained from home health referrals of homebound patients with a diagnosis of COPD, CHF, or cancer, two or more emergency department visits or hospitalizations in the last year, and a prognosis of less than 24 months to live. It was necessary to expand the prognosis to 24 months (compared to the 12-month criteria placed on patients referred to the palliative care model) because of difficulties in prognostication experienced by many of the physicians. We found that physicians were more willing/able to estimate life expectancy when a criterion of 24 months was used. Hence increasing the comparison group criteria to a prognosis of 24 months or less ensured a higher response rate by physicians and therefore an adequate number of comparison patients. This differential in prognosis was only used to create a sufficiently large comparison group study pool.

Care focuses on alleviating the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual discomforts of an individual with a terminal illness who is in the last phases of life. The program structure is similar to the Hospice Medicare benefit with modifications to provide care over longer periods of time. The purpose of the program is to provide an improved model of care combining care modalities and cost savings from the Hospice Model with curative care. Unlike hospice, patients do not have to forego curative care for palliative care services. They may elect to continue restorative treatment while also receiving symptom control, patient education, and psychosocial services. Restorative care in this sense is ameliorative, referring to treatment that will not cure their disease, but will maintain and sustain a reasonable quality of life. By including restorative therapy in the Palliative Care Program model, \"hospice philosophy\" may be introduced without the negative connotation of \"giving up\" that is often associated with hospice. 5,12 Restorative care is not limited, however, patients must agree to the principles of the palliative care program before enrollment. The structure of the Palliative Care Program allows patients to maintain their primary care physician while also receiving home visits from the palliative care physician. Although many patients are reluctant to discontinue services from their primary care physicians at the time of admission to the Palliative Care Program, they gradually decrease primary care physician use once they gain confidence in the palliative care physicians' and team's ability to manage their problems successfully.\nThe Palliative Care Program uses an interdisciplinary team approach, with the central care team consisting of the patient and family plus a physician, nurse, and social worker with expertise in symptom management and biopsychosocial intervention. This method encourages patients, family members and professional caregivers to exchange knowledge and facilitates communication on treatment preferences. 13 The care team is responsible for coordinating and managing care across all settings and providing assessment, evaluation, planning, care delivery, follow-up, monitoring and continuous reassessment of care.\nThe team also provides patient and family education and support. This includes training staff, patients, and families on use of medications, and teaching the patient about self-management and crisis intervention in the home with the goal of stabilizing the patient and minimizing excessive and unnecessary emergency department visits and acute care admissions. This helps the patients and family members to anticipate and often avoid problems, thereby averting potential crises.\nPalliative medical treatment of pain and other symptoms associated with a terminal disease is also emphasized. Pain is assessed at each visit. Telephone support via a toll-free number and after-hours home visits are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week as needed by the patient.

Interviews were conducted via telephone at 7 days after enrollment in either palliative care or the comparison group and every 60 days thereafter. At the time the study was designed, the expected survival period for study participants was anticipated to be greater, hence the selection of a 60-day follow-up interval. Retrospectively, a 30day follow-up interval would have been more appropriate and provided a larger sample. Interviews were conducted by undergraduate and graduate-level research assistants with either the patient or the primary caregiver if the patient was unable to participate, and were approximately 20 minutes in length. Interviewers were blinded to group assignments. The telephone interview protocol was used to gather demographic data, severity of illness, and satisfaction with services. The following instruments were used to measure these domains.\nDemographic data. Patient-specific data were collected relating to personal characteristics of age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, education, and other social characteristics.\nPalliative Performance Scale (PPS). The PPS is a modification of the Karnofsky Performance Scale that provides an assessment of functional status while measuring the progressive decline in patient health and was used to rate severity of illness. Physical performance is rated on five observable factors that include ambulation, activity and evidence of disease, self-care, intake, and consciousness level. Each level of physical performance corresponds with 11 categories that are measured in 10% decrements ranging from fully ambulatory to death. 14 This instrument was adapted by the research team for use over the telephone. Each observable factor was translated into a query with all of the observable descriptions listed as possible responses. Immediately after the interview, the interviewer translated the responses onto the PPS to obtain the total PPS score. Lower scores indicate a lower functioning level. The PPS was used to rate the severity of illness for patients. Internal consistency of this instrument was measured with Cronbach a equal to 0.83. Interrater reliability for scoring telephone PPS was high.\nPatient satisfaction. The Reid-Gundlach Satisfaction with Services instrument was used to measure patient satisfaction with services. 15 The client satisfaction survey is a 13-item instrument that records the overall ratings of satisfaction with services, perception of service providers, and likelihood of positive recommendations of services to others. It is highly reliable with a Cronbach a of 0.96. This instrument was used in managed care settings for a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Special Project of National Significance and was found to have a high internal consistency of 0.86. 16 Service use. At designated points throughout the study, service utilization data for each subject is collected from the KP mainframe database. Ser-vice data collected includes number of emergency department visits, physician office visits, hospital days, skilled nursing facility days, home health and palliative visits, and days on hospice.\nCosts of care. Costs of medical care were calculated based on the 1999 cost of staff time associated with the care. Medication, facility, and administrative costs were not included in the calculations. As a result, the estimates of the costs of care are very conservative. Application of these costs to a nonmanaged care environment would be expected to reveal even greater cost savings.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Human subjects approval", "text": "Effectiveness of this model was studied with funding from the Kaiser Permanente Garfield Memorial Fund.

Subjects initially identified as comparison group subjects who later were admitted to the Palliative Care Program during the study (n 5 17) were excluded from analysis. Differences between study group sample characteristics were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel x 2 tests for nominal level variables, Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal level variables, and independent samples t test for interval/ratio level variables.\nInitial analysis of the entire sample revealed significant differences between the two groups at the time of study enrollment. In order to ensure that the palliative and comparison groups were comparable, a subgroup of patients who had died during the course of the study was selected for analysis. This was done for several reasons. First, because randomization was not used, it is difficult to ascertain the equivalence of the groups. The primary factor of interest in this case would be ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of life expectancy. Difficulties in prognosticating end of life lead to an expansion of enrollment criteria for comparison group members. Therefore, by selecting those who died during the study pe-riod, we can compare relatively similar groups of individuals with comparable life expectancies. The significant differences between groups in terms of days on service and illness severity (as measured by the PPS) were controlled as covariates when service use data were analyzed. Although groups differed in terms of marital status, this variable did not add to the model and was therefore excluded. The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) also served to control for Type I error associated with multiple tests.\nA multiple regression was conducted to determine the portion of costs explained by study group, controlling for days on service, severity of illness, and CHF. These three variables were selected as control variables because initial t test results revealed significant differences between the groups; this is a common occurrence when comparison group are used. Review of the data from the linear regression revealed a violation of the linearity assumption; therefore, a semi-log transformation was conducted on the dependent variable (costs) using LIMDEP 7.0 data analysis software (Econometric Software, Inc., Plainview, NY). After transformation of the dependent variable, a second linear regression was conducted and an examination of a plot of costs and days on service revealed a linear relationship.\nThe smearing estimate 17 was used to retransform the logarithmic dependent variable into real values in order to determine the impact of program enrollment on actual service cost. This method allows for unbiased estimates of the adjusted mean expenditures.

These findings remained highly significant even after controlling for days on service, severity of illness, and having a CHF diagnosis, and the magnitude (45%) is large.\nThis study offers a valuable contribution to research in the area of end-of-life care. According to MedPAC, 18 less than 5% of Medicare recipients die each year, yet the cost of services in the last year of life for this small segment of enrollees represents 25% of total annual Medicare costs. The average Medicare cost for care in the last year of life is $26,000, six times the per capita costs of Medicare survivors. 19 As noted in this study, the palliative care model was able to reduce service use costs at the end of life by 45%. Given the high cost of care in the last year of life, this cost reduction represents tremendous savings in health care. Furthermore, in addition to being costly, acute care at the end of life is not always the preference of the dying patient. According to the SUPPORT Investigators, 20 although most people desire to die at home, approximately 60% of deaths occur in the hospital and 17% in nursing homes. The vast majority of palliative care patients died in their home. In addition, many patients who receive acute care treatment at the end of life undergo aggressive and futile treatments. 21 Hence, the palliative care program provides an ethical alternative to traditional end-of-life care, allowing patients the opportunity to die without pain in the comfort of their home. The reduction in use of emergency care, hospital, skilled nursing facility, and physician office visits for the palliative care group while concomitantly increased home health service use demonstrates the palliative care program's ability to effectively transfer endof life care from high-cost acute care services to a lower cost home based arena that allows patients to die in the comfort of their homes. The significant increase in level of satisfaction with services of palliative care patients from baseline to 60 days after study enrollment supports the transfer of care into the home environment.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HOME-BASED PALLIATIVE CARE PROGRAM FOR EOL", "text": "The TriCentral Service Area's Palliative Care Program enrolled a comparable proportion of ethnic minorities compared to those receiving usual care. Anectodal reports from clinical staff suggest that ethnic differences in end-of-life care communication experienced in this study are reflective of that which has been reported elsewhere 22,23 ; African Americans were more likely to want aggressive care and less likely to have advanced directives. In addition, Asian patients were less likely to report experiencing pain compared to other ethnic groups.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the research design used in the TriCentral Palliative Care study was a comparison group design. To test this model further, randomized controlled studies are needed. This higher level of rigor afforded by this design will strengthen the science behind the project and increase the validity of the findings. Second, the PPS scale was used by telephone interviewers. The instrument was originally designed to be used in person by trained medical professionals. Although interrater reliability was high, using the instrument in this manner may have introduced bias in the overall study, however, this bias was consistent for both study groups. Finally, the potential for generalization of this model to other sites and population are limited. This study was conducted within a closed-system managed care organization that provides an array of services across the continuum of care to its members. Because of the unique nature of managed care programs, considerable modification would be necessary for generalization of the study results to other medical care delivery models. Further, the sample drawn was from the southern California area only and represented patients enrolled over a 15-month period of time. Multisite studies are needed to test the ability to generalize this model to other organizational systems, populations, and communities. Hence, multisite randomized studies will be needed in order to obtain sufficient evidence of the efficacy of this model and its ability to be replicated.\nThe evidence presented in this paper provides an important cornerstone in shifting the care paradigm toward a new and improved continuum of end-of-life care. Through integrating palliative care into curative care practices earlier in the disease projectory, chronically ill patients nearing the end of life are better able to manage their own care in their home, eliminating the need for emergency department visits that are often the gateways to hospital and skilled nursing facility stays. These findings suggest that this new program may offer a more effective and compassionate model of care for those who are nearing end of life.\nThe data presented here offer one method of improving the existing continuum of care for a growing population of chronically ill. Successful replication of this model may hold implications for a shift in care paradigms for chronically ill populations as well as those nearing end of life.

When a family member is also providing daily care for the terminally ill relative, the process can be additionally taxing-with potential adverse emotional and physical health effects on caregivers. A growing body of literature suggests that care-givers are at increased risk of developing adverse mental and physical health effects, including higher rates of depression, worsened immune system functioning, and increased rates of infectious illness. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] One well-designed, longitudinal project showed recently that highly stressed family caregivers have increased risk of mortality compared to noncaregivers and caregivers who do not report subjective burden. 8 Most research on family caregiving has focused on dementia, al-though there is a growing literature on caregiving in cancer, palliative care, and terminal illness as well. [9][10][11][12] Hospice caregivers face particular strains, both in managing high levels of care, and facing the loss of a relative. A recent paper documents that spousal caregivers of hospice patients with either dementia or lung cancer are at increased risk for depression, decreased life satisfaction, and health problems in comparison with noncaregivers. Both groups of caregivers show similar negative mental and physical health consequences of caregiving compared with noncaregivers, despite facing very different stressors. 13 While caregivers as a group show negative effects of caregiving stress, there are also important individual differences in caregiver reactions. Some caregivers experience severe depression and low morale, while others manage to avoid these problems despite facing severe stress. Stress process models [14][15][16] have been used extensively to identify risk and protective factors for caregiver well-being, and to provide a coherent theoretical framework for caregiver psychosocial interventions.\nStress process models specify several types of risk factors including primary caregiving stressors (stressors directly arising from caregiving) and other stresses outside of caregiving, such as poor caregiver health and negative social interactions. Protective factors can include adaptive caregiving appraisals (subjective reactions to problems), personality, coping responses, social networks, and social supports. These variables can be used to predict a variety of well-being measures, such as depression and life satisfaction. The application of a stress process model to caregiving in cancer and end of life settings is described in a detailed theoretical model articulated by Weitzner, et al. 9 While greater severity of patient impairment is sometimes associated with greater caregiver distress, 11,17 some studies find little or no association between objective measures of patient impairment and caregiver depression. [18][19][20] Additional demographic, health, and social factors have been explored as risk factors for caregiving depression. Some of the factors identified in prior research as potential risk factors include female gender, caregivers in poor health, and family conflict. 1,4 Subjective appraisal, or how caregivers subjectively perceive their caregiving duties, has also been identified as important in research on cancer and dementia caregiving. 9,19,21 Higher levels of depression among dementia caregivers was significantly related to the caregiver's appraisals of the subjective stressfulness of behavioral problems in patients and the caregiver's perceived lack of self-efficacy to manage problems that arise, even after controlling for the objective amount of patient impairment. 14 Overall, research has shown that caregivers are more likely to be depressed if they appraised caregiving tasks as stressful, felt less self-efficacy, felt less satisfaction from their role as caregiver, or they found little meaning in their role as caregiver. 19,21,22 Less distress is also typically found in caregivers with larger social networks, higher perceived satisfaction with support, and increased participation in social activities. 4,9,19,20,2 3,24 Despite the growing body of literature suggesting that caregivers are at heightened risk of adverse mental and physical health effects, limited theoretical research has focused on family caregivers providing such care to relatives who are terminally ill. It is imperative to identify predictors of caregiver well-being within hospice settings and to develop theoretical models of the caregiver stress process that can guide conceptually and empirically based psychosocial intervention.\nThe current study examines the applicability of a stress process model for spousal caregivers of the terminally ill. Based on stress process models of caregiving, 9,11 the following hypotheses were proposed:\n1. Objective primary caregiving stressors, including diagnosis, severity of patient impairment and indicators of caregiver involvement in care, would predict only a small proportion of variance in caregiver depression and life satisfaction; 2. Other life stressors, including poor caregiver health and negative social interaction, would be associated with higher levels of depression and lower ratings of life satisfaction; 3. High subjective appraisals of the burden of daily caregiving stressors, and low appraisal of subjective benefits of caregiving, would predict lower levels of depression and better life satisfaction, after controlling for stressors and demographics; and, 4. Better social resources (networks, support, and activities) would predict lower levels of depression and better life satisfaction, after controlling for stressors and demographics.", "n_publication_ref": 34, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Forty caregivers of patients with dementia and 40 caregivers of patients with lung cancer were recruited from LifePath Hospice, a large nonprofit hospice in Tampa, Florida.

This study sought to identify risk and protective factors for depression and life satisfaction among hospice caregivers. Based on the stress process model, several hypotheses were explored. Among primary caregiving stressors, patient HALEY ET AL. 220 diagnosis, patient symptoms, duration of caregiving in months, and hours of caregiving per week were not associated with caregiver depression or life satisfaction on univariate or multivariate regression analysis. This finding is consistent with an extensive prior literature showing that, contrary to common assumptions, objective patient impairment variables and measures of objective caregiving strains do not strongly predict caregiver depression or life satisfaction. Consistent with the hypotheses, other life stressors, such as poor caregiver health and negative social interactions, were associated with higher levels of depression. In addition, better caregiver health was associated with higher ratings of life satisfaction.\nAs hypothesized, caregivers' subjective appraisals, both about the stressfulness of caregiving tasks and about their perceived benefit from caregiving, were more strongly associated with caregiver depression and life satisfaction than were objective indicators of stressors. Caregivers with greater perceived benefits in caregiving, and who appraised caregiving tasks as less stressful, reported greater life satisfaction and lower depression. These effects were significant on the regression analyses even after controlling for objective stressors and demographics.\nAlso consistent with hypotheses, greater social resources were related to caregiver well-being. Although the patterns changed slightly on univariate and multivariate analyses, in general greater numbers of social activities and visits with family and friends, larger social networks, and greater satisfaction with social support were associated with higher life satisfaction and lower depression.\nOverall, the results suggest the utility of the stress process model in developing a better understanding of the well-being of caregivers providing support for terminally ill relatives. In particular, several risk and protective factors were identified relating to caregiver depression and life satisfaction. Predictors of depression among caregivers included female gender, caregiver health problems, negative social interactions, having more negative caregiving appraisals regarding patient self-care and behavioral problems, and fewer social visits and larger social networks. Predictors of lower life satisfaction included female gender, caregiver health problems, less perceived benefits associated with caregiving and higher stressfulness appraisals, and limited social activity. Some of these predictors are also associated with poorer well-being in noncaregiving populations, such as higher levels of depression in women, but these factors appear to be important among family caregivers as well\nThe study has a number of important limitations. One was the lack of sample diversity. Specifically, ethnic minority caregivers are not well represented in the current sample and the results are therefore of limited generalizability for this population. Prior research has shown that DEPRESSION AMONG CAREGIVERS 221 there are racial differences in caregivers' ability to cope with caregiving stressors, 19 which indicates that further study of a more diverse sample of caregivers in a hospice setting is recommended. Another limitation of the current study is the cross-sectional design. We have identified correlates of well-being, rather than demonstrated causal ordering of the variables. Future studies should include a longitudinal design in order to ascertain caregiver adjustment during the final months of their relative's life, and then following the death to assess risk and protective factors relating to caregiver bereavement. The present sample size was relatively small and some factors might be significant predictors with greater power. The sample size was also not sufficient to allow for more sophisticated statistical analyses such as structural equation modeling that have been used in other efforts to evaluate stress process models of caregiving. 38 Finally, future research may benefit from assessment of other variables that have proven promising in other stress process models of caregiving, such as self-efficacy and role overload. 1,39 Hospice programs routinely offer extensive counseling and social services, but there has been little empirical basis to date to guide such services. Outside of hospice, stress process theory has been used to develop conceptually sound psychosocial interventions for caregivers that guide clinicians toward targeting stressors, appraisals, social supports, and other variables such as coping. 40 Systematic reviews of randomized trials of caregiver intervention show that comprehensive psychoeducational and psychotherapy interventions, most of which are based on stress process models, are more effective than supportive interventions alone in reducing caregiver depression and enhancing well-being. 41,42 Further study of the stress process in hospice caregivers is important in designing appropriate, evidence-based interventions for these families. The present findings suggest the possible utility of targeting caregiver appraisals, such as interventions focused on self-efficacy or finding meaning in caregiving, 22,39 and increasing social and leisure activities in caregivers, 43 to enhance their well-being. Because previous research suggests that depression while caregiving is a risk factor for chronic depression during bereavement, 44,45 further study of the stress process and the effectiveness of caregiver interventions within the hospice context is particularly important. Such work will advance the goal of making all hospice care, including psychosocial services, based as much as possible on empirically supported theory and practice. Psychosocial interventions for such complex and difficult problems as geriatric depression, family caregiver distress, and behavioral problems in dementia currently have a strong evidence base, 46 and psychosocial care in hospice and palliative care should strive for stronger empirical and theoretical foundations as well.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Funding for the project was provided by LifePath Hospice, and a grant from the Institute on Aging at the University of South Florida.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Whitlatch CJ: Profiles in Caregiving: The Unexpected Career", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "1995", "authors": "C S Aneshensel; L I Pearlin; J T Mullan; S H Zarit"}, {"title": "Psychological, social, and health impact of caregiving: A comparison of Black and White dementia family caregivers and noncaregivers", "journal": "Psychol Aging", "year": "1995", "authors": "W E Haley; Cac West; V G Wadley; G R Ford; F A White; J J Barrett; L E Harrell; D L Roth"}, {"title": "The family caregiver's role in Alzheimer's disease", "journal": "Neurology", "year": "1997", "authors": "W E Haley"}, {"title": "Psychiatric and physical morbidity effects of dementia caregiving: Prevalence, correlates, and causes", "journal": "Gerontologist", "year": "1995", "authors": "R Schulz; A T O'brien; J Bookwala; K Fleissner"}, {"title": "Spousal caregivers of dementia victims: Longitudinal changes in immunity and health", "journal": "Psychosom Med", "year": "1991", "authors": "J K Kiecolt-Glaser; J R Dura; C E Speicher; O J Trask; R Glaser"}, {"title": "Chronic stress alters the immune response to influenza virus vaccine in older adults", "journal": "Proc Natl Acad Sci", "year": "1996", "authors": "J K Kiecolt-Glaser; R Glaser; S Gravenstein; W B Malarkey; J Sheridan"}, {"title": "Slowing of wound healing by psychological stress", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "1995", "authors": "J K Kiecolt-Glaser; P T Marucha; W B Malarkey; A M Mercado; R Glaser"}, {"title": "SR: Caregiving as a risk factor for mortality: The caregiver health effects study", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1999", "authors": "R Schulz;  Beach"}, {"title": "The family caregiver of the older cancer patient", "journal": "Hematol Oncol Clin North Am", "year": "2000", "authors": "M A Weitzner; W E Haley; H Chen"}, {"title": "Enhancing caregiver outcomes in palliative care", "journal": "Cancer Control", "year": "2001", "authors": "R Mccorkle; J V Pasacreta"}, {"title": "Family caregiver burden from cancer care", "journal": "W.B.

According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), hospices cared for about 775,000 patients in 2001 1 compared to only 100,000 patients in 1984. 2 Much of this increase in hospice utilization can be attributed to passage of the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB) in 1983, which provided Medicare enrollees with coverage for hospice services. Despite this trend to-Departments of 1,3 Internal Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers, Oakland and Richmond, 2 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Ethics Department, and the 4 Kaiser Permanente Division of Research, Oakland, California.\nward increased hospice utilization, only one in five terminally ill patients eligible under the MHB receive hospice services. 3 A proposed reason for this low rate of hospice utilization is that the 1983 legislation paradoxically imposes barriers to hospice access, most notably in the MHB-qualifying requirement that a physician must certify that candidate patients have estimated survivals of 6 months or less. Physicians may hesitate to predict a patient's death within a 6-month time frame because accurate prediction of this survival is difficult. 4,5 Other potential obstacles to hospice utilization reflect attitudinal, informational, economic, societal, and system barriers that are perceived differently by patients, physicians, and health care administrators. Physicians may be influenced or limited in referring terminally ill patients to hospice if they are unaware or uncertain about available hospice services [6][7][8][9][10] ; have personal difficulty accepting death or are uncomfortable discussing end-of-life issues with patients and their families 5,11,12 ; or believe that hospice referral is a signal for patients and their families to lose hope. 11,12 In addition, referral to hospice may be influenced or limited if the physician considering referral perceives or expects that patients and families will be unwilling to elect hospice services, either because they cannot accept the terminal nature of the patient's medical condition 6,10,12 or because they are unwilling to accommodate strangers in the home 10 ; believes that the referral will cause the physician to lose contact with the patient and/or prevent the physician from continuing clinical management of the case 6,10,13 ; or lacks education about end-of-life care [11][12][13] or knowledge about hospice care and reimbursement issues, especially for noncancer diagnoses. 10,11,14 Studies examining physician knowledge and perception about hospice care largely reflect physician populations working outside managed care environments. Conflicting concerns exist about the relation between managed care organizations and hospice services.\nPublic suspicion that cost-containment priorities may motivate health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to more readily refer terminally ill patients to hospice has remained speculative (15). Moreover, cost savings that purportedly accrue from such referral behavior have not been consistently observed. 16 Paradoxically, other public voices have claimed that for reasons of self-interested financial gain, physicians in managed care do not refer patients to hospice often enough. 11 Our goal was to survey physicians working exclusively in a not-for-profit HMO to determine their knowledge about hospice services and diagnoses appropriate for referral, attitudes and perceived barriers toward referral, and perceived hospice referral patterns.", "n_publication_ref": 34, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "The study was approved by the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California Institutional Review Board and was conducted in the Northern California Region of Kaiser Permanente (KP), the nation's largest not-for-profit HMO.

Although we did not set out to determine how these concerns or experiences directly affected physician referral rates to hospice, these concerns or experiences could reasonably be speculated to function as barriers to patient referral.\nThese two findings may reflect internalization by physicians of public wariness about managed care. In a recent survey 11 soliciting opinions from 30 national experts in hospice care, an expert claimed that a physician's \"financial best interest\" in treating dying patients curatively and out of hospice is a barrier to hospice utilization. The authors of that article stated: \"Some physicians today are too busy to manage dying patients well, yet they are unlikely to refer these patients to hospice or another palliative care provider because it is not in their financial best interest. Managed care has contributed to this mindset.\" 11 In the same survey referring to hospice underutilization, the authors quoted one hospice leader as saying, \"Finances-managed care and the cutbacks in the physician's financial opportunityhave been a big, big player.\" 11 Public and professional opinions like these PHYSICIAN SURVEY: HOSPICE CARE AND REFERRAL BARRIERS 415 about physicians who work in managed care environments suffer from being anecdotal and from lacking objective supporting evidence. The speculative nature of these opinions should be appropriately and carefully tested against facts if dying patients and their loved ones are to allay concern about hospice utilization. Unfounded sentiments biased against managed care may discourage hospice utilization if they are internalized-as they apparently are by some physicians who practice in managed care settings. Although the physicians in our survey were salaried employees who received no personal reimbursement related to intensity or cost of individual patient care, many of the physicians had nonetheless internalized antihospice sentiments. Because no published data are available, we are uncertain whether these findings might differ with physician populations in for-profit HMO environments.\nTwenty-eight percent of our physicians indicated that their lack of knowledge about hospice services and eligibility requirements limited their use of hospice. This finding resembled that of another study, which assessed physician knowledge about hospice care in non-HMO settings. 8 Although the remaining 72% of physicians in our study did not believe that any lack of knowledge hindered their hospice referrals, only 12% of all physicians were aware of the National Hospice Organization \"Medical Guidelines for Determining Prognoses in Selected Noncancer Diseases.\" 18 Moreover, when asked to identify noncancer diagnoses specified by those guidelines as appropriate candidate diagnoses for hospice referral, most physicians (84%) failed to recognize all appropriate diagnoses.\nThis discordance between physicians' self-perceived and actual knowledge about hospice referral suggests a need for greater educational efforts designed to enhance appropriate referral behavior by physicians. These educational efforts must extend beyond the goal of expanding informational databases. Educational efforts must also address elements of the relationship between patients and doctors that enhance open and direct discussion about death and end-of-life care. For example, despite current national end-of-life educational efforts aimed at physicians, 15% of the physicians in our survey were hesitant to discuss terminal diseases with their patients, and 22% stated that they were inadequately trained for such a discussion. Physicians' difficulty in confronting the death of their patients was also the most cited reason for referring patients to hospice: Physicians believed that hospice staff were better able to guide patients and family through the dying process. Other studies 6,10 involving physicians in non-HMO health care settings have supported the need for more physician education to help them develop skills that enhance communication with patients and families about dying and hospice care.\nTo serve these educational aims, our finding that 28% of our physicians were concerned that patients would interpret hospice referral as a cost-containing measure suggests that a broader educational campaign should be developed to incorporate the public's interest. To address public trust and confidence in modern managed care, studies are needed to clearly delineate the fiscal policies and interests of health care institutions in relation to hospice use and end-of-life care services.\nOur survey of staff and resident physicians revealed several incongruencies. For example, more than three quarters of our physicians felt hospice was an underutilized service, but only 15% stated they personally underreferred. Not surprisingly, those physicians with a personal experience with hospice involving a family member or close friend were more likely to deny that a lack of knowledge about hospice services limited their referrals. However, there was no difference in the percent of physicians correctly identifying the eight candidate diagnoses regardless of self-perceived knowledge. Fully 85% of the physicians stated they made hospice referrals when appropriate, yet only 16% could correctly identify candidate hospice-designated diagnoses. Even among those who indicated a personal lack of knowledge limited their use of hospice services for their patients, only 33% stated they personally underreferred. This suggests an overall perception by our physicians that hospice services are underutilized; however there also appears to be a disconnect between an individual physician's self-perceived knowledge and actual knowledge. This disconnect may partially explain the less than expected success of some end-of-life training efforts. If physicians consider themselves adequately trained in these areas, they may be less motivated to avail themselves of end-of-life education.\nIt is also interesting that physicians in practice less than 6 years were more likely to consider hos-", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BRICKNER ET AL.", "text": "pice underutilized when compared to physicians in practice 6 years or more. Perhaps this reflects improved end-of-life training in medical schools and some residency training programs, although end-of-life education still remains limited in these settings. Possibly, recently trained physicians are more comfortable with current models of healthcare practices that involve discontinuous patient care. For example, many have trained in an era in which the clinic-based physician may relinquish care of his or her patients to a hospitalbased or a subspecialty physician. Therefore, these recently trained physicians may more readily accept transferring care of their patients with a less than 6-month prognosis to a hospice team.\nOur survey was limited in several ways, including its omission of data collection about physician awareness of the fundamental qualification for hospice referral, regardless of diagnosis or DNR status, that is, hospice eligibility based upon a determination that, in a physician's judgment, a patient had a prognosis of 6 months or less if his or her illness ran its normal course. (We had already embedded this 6-month prognostic requirement in the text of survey questions). We also did not directly test whether physicians felt that concern about being charged with cost-containment priorities when making a hospice referral consciously functioned as a referral barrier.\nThe emergent situation of our changing population dynamics underscores the urgency with which educational efforts must proceed. Demographic projections indicate that by 2030, almost one in five Americans will be at least 65 years of age, 19 a statistic suggesting that even more people than currently will be living with terminal conditions and could benefit from hospice care. Although most Americans express a preference to die at home, most American deaths occur in hospitals or in subacute care facilities. The psychosocial, personal, economic, and legislative factors creating barriers that account for this current discrepancy must be addressed in a timely way if we hope to avert an even greater national crisis involving resource allocation and access to end-of-life care. In addition, if the nation's health care transition toward managed care models continues, these problems will expand unless we begin to use more objective evaluation to deconstruct the barriers created by public and professional perceptions or misperceptions of managed care.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We believe that our study is the first major published survey of physician attitudes and practices relating to hospice utilization in a not-for-profit HMO setting.

However, before researchers can develop and test palliative care interventions directed to families, it is important to identify barriers that may confront health care professionals with regard to the provision of supportive family care. For new interventions to be feasible they must be applicable within the constraints of current palliative care service delivery environments.

[5][6][7][8] These authors assert that caregivers are often prone to negative physical, social and emotional sequelae. Moreover, research conducted for more than a decade has demonstrated that caregivers themselves report unmet needs. 7,[9][10][11] Commonly these needs encompass a desire for more information and support from health care professionals. 10,[12][13][14] As a consequence of the substantive body of literature on the impact of being a caregiver and the unmet needs of caregivers, there has been an urgent request by many authors for the development of supportive interventions to assist family caregivers. 10,[15][16][17] A recent systematic review of interventions for palliative care families identified that interventions to date are underdeveloped and researchers must consider carefully the design of interventions and their practical application in order to increase the likelihood of effectiveness. 18 Family intervention research design recommendations have been made. [18][19][20][21][22] However, prior to the development and testing of new interventions to augment the care provided to palliative care families, the common challenges that currently confront health care professionals' capacity to provide optimal support need to be more explicit. Without this disclosure there is a danger that interventions may not be relevant within the practice setting and hence may fail to meet intended aims. A more logical approach is to implement supportive interventions developed in recognition of common practice-based barriers. The ensuing discussion provides an outline of the common challenges affecting a health care professional's capacity to meet the supportive care needs of family members caring for a relative in need of palliative care and has relevance for inpatient, outpatient and home-based care.\nThis analysis of challenges to the provision of family-centred care is based upon a review and synthesis of published palliative family care literature cited in the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Web of Science, between the years 1990-2002. The following keywords were utilized in the search: palliative, hospice, family, cancer, and caregivers. Key palliative care texts were also reviewed. The paper also draws on experience of the authors who, collectively, have two decades of clinical and research experience with palliative care families.\nThe supportive care challenges fall into three broad categories: family-related challenges, health system barriers, and communication process barriers.

Indeed, access to visiting health care professionals may be blocked by patients. 26 One caregiver in Smith's study 26  Furthermore caregivers may not want to put their needs before those of the patient or may believe that their concerns are inevitable and cannot be met. 6 Given the fact that the patient and family may have very different needs this makes it difficult for health care professionals to determine whose needs take priority. 27 ", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Underdeveloped frameworks for conceptualizing family caregiving in palliative care", "text": "Currently, a sophisticated model for conceptualizing the experience of family caregiving within the domain of palliative care has not been developed.

The idea of meaning in experience has been expanded by more recent work by Folkman. 41 Moreover, this transactional model recognizes that it is the family member's unique response to caregiving, including the family dynamics that impacts on the family member's psychological reaction and not the caregiving event itself.

It may therefore be difficult to assess the need for and develop supportive strategies if caregivers and patients are restricting what they disclose.\nPerhaps this conspiracy of silence is not restricted to family caregivers and patients but exists for health care professionals also. 46 Clinicians may at times feel uncomfortable with or avoid dealing with issues related to death and dying. 16 This may occur because of health care professionals own lack of preparedness to help others deal with this issue or alternatively they may be reluctant to break the conspiracy of silence occurring between caregiver and patient.

Health care professionals are commonly obliged to evaluate complex situations during brief encounters.

Including the care of relatives within the intrinsic aim of palliative care has been considered to be unrealistic; resources are stretched enough in caring for patients and considering their interests. 52 For the family to truly be treated as the unit of care, additional family oriented strategies and resources are required. Currently it is difficult, within existing care models, for health care professionals to be expected to meet the needs of both patients and families. 27 A second resource issue concerns informational resources for family caregivers. Caregivers should be offered a variety of supportive informational tools in the form of written materials and videotapes and audiotapes. To date, few such family-specific resources are available. Moreover, the provisions of written aides to caregivers by contemporary palliative care professionals is apparently sporadic and the effectiveness of these interventions unmeasured. Often educational materials are written for patients. Family caregivers need their own educational materials that incorporate problem solving strategies, how to care for their relatives, how to maintain their own health and how to deal with bereavement. 53 Payne et al. 54 conducted a national survey in the United Kingdom in an effort to evaluate the quality and type of written information provided to patients and families by palliative care units. The study identified that more than 1000 different leaflets were being used. Most leaflets dealt with general hospice information (97%), and 89% of leaflets were produced internally. It was estimated that only 40% of the British population could understand the content. These authors concluded that many patients and families may be unable to gather appropriate written information about palliative care.\nA suitable range of evidence-based videotapes or audio tapes aimed specifically at guiding caregivers of patients who are confronted with lifethreatening cancer does not exist.

Furthermore, one palliative care service may be responsible for care during the day, while another provides after-hour resources. Not surprisingly therefore, some caregivers may feel as though continuity of care is suboptimal. 55 Even in the first scenario where the care is conducted by one palliative care service provider, there may be a variety of health care professionals who enter the home. This multiplicity of health care providers potentially hinders the development of trusting relationships between caregiver and professional. 7 While health care recipients value continuity of care and relationships promoting trust and confidence, unfortunately continuity is a benefit that few receive. 25 In fact, a caregiver in one study 56 requested discontinuation of the palliative care service because of his frustration with the number of different care providers giving input.

These preferences were especially noteworthy because they were expressed with little knowledge of existing end-of-life care.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Families provide care for loved ones", "text": "Participants in our groups reported that the role of family was of central importance when a loved one was dying. In both the African American and Latino groups there was a strong current of filial piety and a tradition of sacrificing personal needs in the service of the family. Participants reported that family members, especially spouses and children, were the primary caretakers of ill and dying loved ones. Participants repeatedly stated that a dying person's contact with loved ones should not be limited in any way. In every group the presence of family and MINORITY END-OF-LIFE CARE 249 friends was mentioned as something that would be of great comfort to the patient and for which there was no substitute. The strength and cohesion of families at the end of life was evidenced repeatedly as people talked about leaving jobs and traveling great distances in order to care for or be with a family member who was seriously ill. As one Latina woman stated, \"That's the way it is in our families. It's like, if you can do it (care for a sick parent), then you do it. If you can't, then you're going to leave your job, or whatever. But our family comes first. Our parents come first.\" Even participants with a preference for dying in the hospital often qualified this with statements of wanting their loved ones to be present in the hospital whenever possible.\nThe preference for informed, family-directed end-of-life care was a subtheme that typically emerged when the prospect of hospitalization was considered. Family-directed care was defined as the preference for family members to reach consensus and direct care together. The emphasis on collective decision-making was more noticeable because of the virtual absence of remarks concerning autonomy, individual wishes, or resistance of family wishes. \"I think we are what I call selfish, because we don't want to let go. But then I thought in terms, I love her so much. I didn't want her to suffer. On the other hand, my brother had to question it, so we said well, take your time\" [Latina female]. Participants reported feeling a need to have an accurate understanding of what lay ahead and a sense of control for the family and the patient.\nWithin this context, there was considerable consensus over the need for the family's decisions to be respected and carried out. Participants believed that the responsibility lay with the medical community to proactively inform families of what they could expect, both from the disease process and from the health care system. \"On top of keeping them comfortable, keeping the whole family comfortable on what exactly is going on with them and what we can do to make them feel better in their last days\" [African American female].\nAlthough both the African American and Latino groups emphasized family-directed care, there were important differences between the groups. For example, the Latinos were more likely than the African Americans to express avoiding the prolongation of dying. \"I don't want to linger. I think we all pray for a quick death\"\n[Latina female]. This was mentioned in every Latino group, but was mentioned in only one African American group. African American participants were more likely to mention access to the best medical treatments and a focus on life rather than death. \"I'm not going to accept it if he (the doctor) tells me I have only 2 years to live. . . . My grandmother always told me 'illness is the devil-you rebuke him.' I'll be the one to prove them wrong\" [African American male].", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Desire to reduce caretaker burden", "text": "In all groups, the concern for caretaker burden was clearly expressed and indicated a real need for services, including regular assistance with patient care, pain and medication management advice, psychological support, and respite care. One African American woman said, I feel that the caregivers themselves deserve a break. I feel my sister carried all the burden for about 2 or 3 years now. So that's what I wanted to speak on. The people that are the caregivers, where do they get a break? When you want to scream, where do you go?\nThere was a general consensus that caretakers need relief from their physical duties on a regular basis, and also need help adjusting to the stress of being a caretaker and the grief of losing their loved-one. When the possibility of receiving in-home hospice care for a terminally ill lovedone was discussed, there was only one participant from all the focus groups who expressed misgivings about accepting the help based on how that care might be perceived by the patient. \"It seems like Mexican people, if you don't prepare a meal for them, if you go out and get it, it's not the same. So if you have hospice come in, would the elderly person, or family member view it as you're not doing your job?\" [Latina female].\nAn interesting dichotomy was revealed as participants spoke of the difficulties of caretaking. Participants reported that although they wanted to care for their families, they did not want their own families to have to care for them. Participants who had been caretakers themselves and were fully aware of the demands of caretaking expressed this feeling most often; \"I'd rather not be in a nursing home, but I wouldn't want family care. I wouldn't want to burden my family\"\n[African American female]. Participants further recognized the hardship of having to make final arrangements after a loved one dies, and expressed a desire to minimize this burden on caretakers as well. One Latina woman who talked about making arrangements for her husband's death while he was ill said, \"I did mine when I had to do my husband's. I said just keep going and fill out my part right now because I said my kids are not going to go through this.\" Overall, there was a deep familiarity with the toll caretaking can have over time and conflicting emotions over participants' sacrifices for others, versus others' sacrifices for them, and the sense that attitudes about filial piety might be changing.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Spirituality as the primary means of coping", "text": "Consistent with prior research, [36][37][38] participants emphasized the importance of spirituality as the primary means for patients and their families to cope with suffering and death. Spirituality and faith in God emerged as a major source of comfort in both the African American and Latino groups. God, religion, and spirituality were spoken of as essential components of the coping process for patients and families throughout every phase of life and death. The state of a person's relationship with God was seen as a mediator of the personal distress or peace and comfort of the death and dying process as expressed in the following quote by an African American woman, \"First of all, I'd like to know that I am ready for the other side, my soul is right. That would have to be the first thing.\" Prayer was mentioned repeatedly as a way: (1) for the dying to cope with their symptoms; (2) for the families to bear the burden of watching a loved one suffer; and (3) to give thanks for the gift of life. The place of spirituality was so fundamental as to be unquestioned by anyone in any group.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Concern for the holistic well-being of the patient/family", "text": "Participants consistently discussed the needs of hospice patients and their families in a holistic, rather than strictly medical context. They were mindful of patients' physical and emotional needs as well as daily well-being and quality of life for the patient, caretakers, and larger family. Inherent in this concern for holistic care was the idea of effective communication with providers who had a relationship with the patient and cared to prevent suffering. These elements of genuine caring and understanding were repeatedly identified as necessary for the well-being of the patient and the \"peace of mind\" of the whole family. \"Where it all starts is with the physicians and the nurses. Even if they are short-staffed, if they treat the people with respect or kindness or even interest, that doesn't cost any money\" [Latina female]. Not surprisingly, every group expressed the need for care that anticipated the patient's medical and hygiene needs and ensured freedom from pain and suffering. \"The last thing I would want to do is die in misery. I think pain control is 100% important\" [African American male].\nCommon to both the Latino and African American groups was the view of hospitals as being sterile, rigid places where routines and procedures often take precedence over an individual's needs. Nevertheless, participants also described hospitalization as the way to get expert and complete care (including symptom relief) and as a step that would reduce caretaker burden. These impressions resulted in the expression of conflicting emotions concerning hospitalization near the end of life. \"I wouldn't want to burden my family . . . leave me in the hospital\" [Latina female]. Most participants preferred that their loved ones be in the most peaceful and comforting environment possible without compromising medical care. There was acceptance that loved ones might have to be hospitalized if families were unable to manage their pain or provide necessary care, but this was coupled with the strong opinion that even in the hospital, patients ought to be able to have many of the comforts of home, such as family care, visitors, favorite possessions, activities, and treats. \"I think I would want dignity and respect. Maybe some ice cream, maybe some pudding. If I have a little request, listen to it. Wash my hair. Brush my teeth\" [Latina female].\nConcerns about preserving the dignity, privacy, and modesty of patients, especially female patients, were common among Latino participants. \"The women who were there taking care of her treated her with respect and they knew she was embarrassed about the diapers being changed. . . . They did it in such a way that made her feel not to be so ashamed\" [Latina female].

They placed", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MINORITY END-OF-LIFE CARE", "text": "value on an environment that encouraged hope, positive attitude, and striving for life.\nThe importance of having someone to listen to the patient and respond with genuine interest and caring was mentioned in every African American group. Although the company of friends and family was valued highly, participants were quick to say that people without family or friends deserved this special attention as well. African American groups also reported that an ideal death experience would be one where the physical and financial stresses of life are removed from the patient: \"No bills, no pain, no bills, no stress from inside or outside\" [African American female]. African Americans were also more likely to talk about the value of having a counselor who helped the patient and family adjust to and cope with their impending losses. Although Latino groups did not cite grief counseling as an area of need, group members did express deep appreciation for counseling they had received. \"Well the nurses they sent were really nice. They helped me a lot, gave me support. Everybody needs support when you know there is nothing you can do. And they talk to you very nice\" [Latina female].\nIn addition to these preferences, the team also identified four barriers to utilization of hospice that all fell under the category of lack of access to care. Common barriers included lack of awareness of hospice, and prohibitive cost of health care. More culturally specific barriers included language/cultural barriers and a lack of confidence in the health care system.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Lack of awareness of hospice services", "text": "The primary access issue was the overwhelming lack of awareness of hospice among focus group participants.

This lack of awareness was striking across groups, even those in which participants had reported some prior knowledge of hospice. \"Spanish-speaking people don't even know what the hospice concept is and maybe I don't even know what the hospice concept is\" [Latina female]. One African American man stated: \"Another thing I would like to mention is that hospice, when you mention hospice to people, they don't know what the hell you're talking about. What is hospice, really?\" Sometimes comments regarding lack of awareness also touched directly on issues of access to health care, such as: Let's say a person comes to the hospital, and you know he's terminal. You know he's going to have a whole lot of problems. Isn't there someone who's supposed to explain all this to you and let you know exactly what forms of help you could get and where you can get counseling or education?

When mistrust was mentioned, it typically focused on quality of care. I, for one, don't put a whole lot of faith in doctors, because they can mislead you. They tell you things that are untrue. They give you medications without checking to see if they should give you that medication or if it mixes well with another medicine that you're taking. They don't bother to do that. I don't get medication from a doctor ever without going and looking up in a book to see if it (interacts) with something else that I'm taking [African American female].\nThe high cost of health care contributed to the mistrust of the health care system as illustrated by the following quote.\nI believe most doctors are just like most lawyers; they get into the profession because they are purely motivated by money. They're not motivated because they want to help people [African American female].\nPrejudice and discrimination were mentioned as concerns that further contributed to mistrust and underutilization of health care.\nWe're Black. These White folks won't help, and that's the mind-set. I was reading an article in the paper the other day about health care among the African American community. They are less likely to get proper care. Why? [African American male]. Another African American woman said, I think culture comes into play on both ends. . . . Say if you have an Indian doctor that comes in, my grandmother says, \"one of those foreigners came in, what does he know?\" . . . and then on the flip side of it . . . if you were a Black male being transported to the hospital with a gunshot wound . . . do we provide the same healthcare service for him that we would provide for a Caucasian male that comes in because he had an accident on his four wheeler? So it (discrimination) does play a big role in how people are cared for.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The four principal preference themes identified in this study reveal a receptive attitude toward end-of-life care services that provide physical and emotional relief for the patient and care givers. Respect for a family's care decisions and the fundamental priority of spirituality were also emphasized. Finally, participants expressed a need for holistic care that included better communication and a greater sense of caring from the medical community. African Americans were more likely to emphasize the value of a person's remaining life, while Latinos were more likely to emphasize preserving the dignity of the patient.\nThese preferences mesh well with the philosophies of many palliative and hospice care services working within the current United States health care system. The primary goal of palliative and hospice care is to improve quality of life at the end of life by providing compassionate communication, spiritual support, psychosocial support, symptom control and proactive informed decision-making. 43,44 Central to this mission is the ex-", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MINORITY END-OF-LIFE CARE", "text": "ploration of family values and goals for care and determination of the most comfortable end-of-life setting for the patient and family. 45 Often this means supporting primary caretakers in their homes. Sometimes it means providing care within a private setting or a hospital that ensures patient-directed end-of-life decision-making. In any setting, end-of-life care is intended to embrace and support patients' spirituality and prioritize care that reflects patients' beliefs and spiritual choices. Finally, end-of-life care routinely provides emotional and psychosocial support to the patient and family during the grief process. The primary themes that emerged in these focus groups suggest that the needs and preferences of African Americans and Latinos are consistent with the priorities for care espoused by the hospice movement and that home hospice services may be particularly well suited to meeting these needs.\nBarriers voiced by participants were primarily related to access to care. Lack of awareness of hospice services emerged as the barrier most often cited to explain lack of utilization of hospice services. Barriers concerning access to health care that were not specific to end-of-life care also permeated discussions. Not surprisingly, given the cost of health care and the low-income level of this study's participants, inability to pay for care was cited as a significant barrier to receiving any kind of health care. Among Latinos, inability to find Spanish-speaking health care professionals reduced access and quality of care. Finally, a lack of confidence in the health care system (mistrust) was frequently mentioned as well. These misgivings did not necessarily prevent people from seeking care, but rather promoted vigilance about quality of care. This vigilance was more prevalent among African Americans.\nMistrust of the health care system has repeatedly been reported as a factor affecting African Americans' behavior and attitudes. 7,12,23,46 -48 However, there is little evidence directly linking this mistrust with attitudes and behavior. 21 This is an area in which further study is needed to understand whether mistrust is unique to African Americans, how mistrust influences behavior, and how to provide information and services to counteract this mistrust if it has a negative affect on health. There is some evidence suggesting that mistrust of the health care system by African Americans may be warranted, and that change needs to occur within healthcare before trust can be reasonably expected to develop. 21,26,49,5 0 Although we had hoped to identify differences in attitudes or preferences based on prior knowledge of hospice, our inability to accurately gauge prior knowledge may limit the conclusions drawn from our findings. Additionally, we did not explain hospice services before eliciting participants' opinions about end-of-life care, which may have resulted in the expression of different opinions than if we had included an education component. However, the preferences and barriers we identified may have been more accurate reflections of naive preferences and barriers, since they were unlikely to have been based on misperceptions of or reactions to the system.\nWithin Latino communities, providing educational materials in Spanish, and having Spanishspeaking employees to ascertain the needs of patients and families would likely decrease barriers to hospice use. Our finding that dignity and modesty in death were areas of particular importance to Latino participants is consistent with other qualitative research. 29 The lack of emphasis on other elements of holistic care among Latino participants was also consistent with prior research suggesting that these families may welcome assistance with skilled medical care, but expect to provide for the patient's other needs within the context of the family. 29 Within African American communities, issues related to mistrust about the standard of care provided by hospice might be most important to address. Secondarily, end-of-life care is meant to affirm the value of a life lived and recognize that death is a natural and normal process. 51 This perspective complements the focus on maximizing and valuing life seen in our African American groups. Emphasizing this perspective may make end-of-life care more acceptable in African American communities.\nResults of this qualitative study suggest that our African American and Latino participants would welcome and benefit from end-of-life care services. We would like to conclude that addressing specific preferences and barriers within minority communities, such as those identified in this study, would likely contribute to utilization of hospice, family satisfaction, and improved quality of life for patients and their caregivers. However, there are a number of other issues that affect utilization of care in low-income commu-nities, including availability of providers willing to take patients without private insurance and of staff who are bilingual and/or willing to go into any area of the city to provide care. A significant limitation of this study is its inability to determine whether the attitudes and beliefs elicited could be explained by characteristics other than race or ethnicity, such as income and insurance status. Future research would be more helpful in disentangling these issues if groups of majority and minority populations with adequate income and access to care were included for comparison.\nIn the meantime, interventions aimed at increasing awareness of end-of life services (informing outpatients about hospice and the medicare hospice benefit; informing inpatients about palliative services available) would likely affect both minority and nonminority populations with limited access to care. Finally, future research should investigate whether prevalent attitudes and/or systemic problems differentially influence physicians' willingness to discuss hospice and palliative care options with minority patients.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "The evolution of palliative care", "journal": "Patient Educ Couns", "year": "2000", "authors": "C Saunders"}, {"title": "Understanding economic and other burdens of terminal illness: The experience of patients and their caregivers", "journal": "Ann Intern Med", "year": "2000", "authors": "E J Emanuel; D L Fairclough; J Slutsman; L L Emanuel"}, {"title": "The low frequency of futility in an adult intensive care unit setting", "journal": "Arch Intern Med", "year": "1996", "authors": "A Halevy; R C Neal; B A Brody"}, {"title": "The effect of do-not-resuscitate orders on physician decision-making", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "2002", "authors": "M C Beach; R S Morrison"}, {"title": "Ethnicity and attitudes towards life sustaining technology", "journal": "Soc Sci Med", "year": "1999", "authors": "L J Blackhall; G Frank; S T Murphy; V Michel; J M Palmer; S P Azen"}, {"title": "Differences in end-of-life decision making among black and white ambulatory cancer patients", "journal": "J Gen Intern Med", "year": "1996", "authors": "E D Mckinley; J M Garrett; A T Evans; M Danis"}, {"title": "Ethnicity and advance care directives", "journal": "J Law Med Ethics", "year": "1996", "authors": "S T Murphy; J M Palmer; S Azen; G Frank; V Michel; L J Blackhall"}, {"title": "Patient preferences for communication with physicians about end-of-life decisions.

Continual intravenous infusion produces lipid accumulation and prolonged terminal excretion. ever if pain is not controlled, a clinician maydecide to administer the new opioid at the calculated equianalgesic dose or at a percentage increase (25%-100%) based on the severity of pain. Information other than the equianalgesic calculation should be taken into consideration in determining the new dose, including the drug's half-life, bioavailability, drug interactions, hepatic and renal clearance, the patient's type of pain and prior opioid exposure. 20 As always, individual patient response must be observed, and doses and intervals between doses need to be titrated according to the patient's response.\nIt is important to recognize that the way in which a drug is administered (eg, single dose, divided doses, or continuous dosing) is determined by the route, product formulation, clinical pharmacology of the drug, and by the clinical situation. 13 Because of their complete bioavailability, intravenous doses are generally provided hourly or as a continuous infusion. Although intermittent bolus doses of intramuscular and subcutaneous opioids are considered equipotent with IV dose, these modes of administration are dosed at longer intervals because they provide a slower time course due to the systemic absorption required from the depot site. 12 The availability of extended release oral formulations allow for dosing of morphine as infrequently as every 12-24 hours when pain is constant and around-the-clock dosing is required. Recently, the use of a single dose of an opioid with a long duration of action for selected short pain experiences, such as migraine headache or postoperative pain, has been suggested. 2 ", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HOW TO CALCULATE AN EQUIANALGESIC DOSE", "text": "There are a number of ways to calculate an equianalgesic dose.

For example, look at Table 1 and find the oral dose listed for morphine (30 mg) and the parenteral dose (10 mg). This gives a 30:10 or 3:1 ratio for oral to parenteral morphine. This means that it takes approximately 3 times more morphine orally than parenterally to produce the same analgesic effect. One can simply multiply any IV morphine amount by 3 to determine the approximate equianalgesic oral morphine dose. Now examine the ratio between oral hydromorphone and oral morphine. You can see from Table 1 that 7.5 mg of oral hydromorphone is equal to 30 mg of oral morphine. 7.5 mg to 30 mg is a 1:4 ratio (if you can't immediately see this ratio, divide the smaller number into the larger number, 7.5 goes into 30 four times). So a patient taking 4 mg of hydromorphone PO q4h is taking the equivalent of 16 mg of morphine PO q4h. Setting up a ratio makes it easy to view the difference between the 2 drugs. The difficulty of ratios is that there is not always a convenient one, particularly between different opioids. Take for example the ratio between oral hydromorphone (7.5 mg) and the parenteral dose of morphine (10 mg). The ratio is 7.5:10 or 3:4.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PROPORTIONS", "text": "A second method is to set up simple math proportions using ratios.

Although an equianalgesic calculation can be performed for a single dose, when a change is made it is best to convert the total 24-hour amount of opioid currently being used to the 24-hour dose of the new preferred route and drug, and then divide this amount by the appropriate dosing interval. For example, if a patient is receiving a continuous IV infusion, calculating the oral equivalent of only 1 hour of infusion would not be very helpful for determining an oral dose. Take the following example: a patient receiving an IV infusion of 7 mg of morphine per hour. Using the ratio between oral and IV morphine from Table 1 (3:1), we can see that the equivalent oral dose is approximately (7 mg X 3 =) 21 mg of morphine. However, readers would agree that we would not want to give a patient an oral dose every hour, because the duration of action of oral morphine is 3-4 hours for shorter acting preparations and 8-24 hours for extended release products.

This is often expressed as a relationship with God, but it can also be about nature, art, music, family, or community-whatever beliefs and values give a person a sense of meaning and purpose in life. So, a spiritual history is a beliefs or values history that explicitly opens the door to a conversation about the role of spirituality and religion in the person's life.\nThis conversation is extremely important for patients who are gravely ill and for dying patients. Spiritual questions that come up for these patients include: What gives my life meaning? Why is this thing happening to me? How will I survive this loss? What will happen to me when life ends?\nWe as clinicians don't know the answers, but I do see it as our role to support and encourage people as they search for their own answers to these questions.

Physicians are called to a service profession-our job is caring for people-I think that in and of itself is spiritual work.\nWhat has happened over the last 30 years is that science has really led medicine, and a lot of the nontechnical aspects of medicine have been neglected. The spiritual assessment brings us back to those compassionate, caregiving roots of the patient-doctor relationship. Doing the spiritual history also helps health care providers understand the role that spirituality plays in the patient-clinician relationship itself.\nCenter to Improve Care of the Dying, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.\n2\nCenter for Applied Ethics and Professional Practice, Education Development Center, Inc., Newton, Massachusetts.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PUCHALSKI AND ROMER", "text": "Can you say a little more about that?\nLet me speak specifically about doctors because that's the group I'm part of and that I work with the most. Every profession has some differences; however, I believe this applies to all the healthcare professions. For physicians, we are so burdened by time, stress, and the enormous amount of technical knowledge that we have to learn that many of us come out of medical school not very well trained to communicate with patients about things like end-of-life decisions or nonphysical suffering. So we tend to rely on what we're most comfortable with, which is our technical training. But in fact, patients are very dissatisfied with that sort of patient-doctor relationship because they want doctors to be caring, in addition to being technically skilled. A Gallup survey was done in 1997, which looked at what people said they would want if they were dying. Having warm, caring relationships with their physicians was one of the responses. These same respondents also reported that doctors are lacking in these relationship skills. I think that part of the reason for this gap is that, as physicians, we don't take that time to get to know the person in the patient. We walk into the office, act very quickly, focus on the things we're comfortable with, i.e., medications and prescriptions, and then leave.\nWhen you get involved in a discussion with a patient about his or her spirituality, you enter the domain of what gives that person meaning and purpose. When you begin to find out about why the person is suffering, and to listen to that person, you can't help but notice a change in the quality of the relationship. Physicians who have incorporated the spiritual assessment write back and tell me about it. They say that the nature of the patient-doctor relationship changes-as soon as they bring up these questions, they feel that it establishes a certain level of intimacy in terms of really understanding who that person is at a much deeper level than they are accustomed to.

What are the stresses in your life? Are you fearful about dying? Do you have any fears of the future? How do you think your family is coping with all this?\" Those are very important and relevant questions, and some spiritual aspects may emerge from those questions, but these questions are more targeted at psychological or social issues, such as how the person is feeling, financial pressure, or physical well-being.\nThe spiritual domain includes more than questions about how a person is coping. The questions I'm interested in are: Are there issues of despair? Meaning? Purpose? Belief in a god or an afterlife? People often feel, particularly when they're dying, that their life has no meaning. A patient might be able to answer all of those psychosocial questions by saying, \"My family helps me cope,\" or \"I have a social worker that works with me to resolve my financial problems.\" Although a person may be able to answer these questions, still, at a very deep place inside himself or herself, the person is despairing. The patient might feel that life has lost its purpose, which might not come out in a psychosocial interview. Certainly belief in God, belief in an afterlife, all those kinds of things probably won't come out in a typical medical interview, and yet we're seeing from a number of surveys that spiritual issues are very important to a lot of people. Oftentimes they need permission to talk about those kinds of issues. Without some signal from the physicians, patients may feel that these topics are not appropriate or welcome.\nIn a spiritual assessment, my opening question is about the presence of faith or belief (\"F\") so I ask, \"Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?\" 1 I find this is a very different opening from \"What helps you cope?\" I open the interview up to however that person wants to answer it. I don't have an agenda and that's very important. Religious people will right away feel an affinity for that question. People who are not religious, but who are spiritual will understand it that way. Occasionally, I've had someone say that they're neither, and then I ask, \"What gives your life meaning and purpose?\" However, following a question that talks about spiritual or religious beliefs, then the meaning or purpose question takes on a different tone. Then, I take the patient's lead.\nI have a patient who feels that nature is very important, and she said something like, \"I'm a naturalist, and looking at trees makes me feel really centered and with purpose.\" In fact, one of the things she said was that if she were dying, SPIRITUAL HISTORY 131", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Spiritual Assessment Tool", "text": "An acronym that can be used to remember what is asked in a spiritual history is: F: Faith or Beliefs I: Importance and influence C: Community A: Address Some specific questions you can use to discuss these issues are: 5.

In the past, spirbut to be able to talk about those issues. Answers itual assessment has been rather simplistic or lim-132 PUCHALSKI AND ROMER ited, merely asking patients about their religious denomination. So I developed the second domain where I am striving to get to how a person's spiritual beliefs-if it's nature, music, art, or a particular religion-how these beliefs influence that person in the way that that person cares for him or herself. This is the domain I refer to as \"I\", in the acronym for \"importance,\" or the influence of those spiritual beliefs on the person's life. So, with a dying patient, the question would be, \"How do these beliefs influence the ways you are coping with dying? How do they influence the ways you are making end-of-life decisions?\"\nPeople have intrinsic spiritual beliefs, but they may also have extrinsic ways of expressing these beliefs. The third domain, known as \"C\", refers to the person's community. The community aspect may be what's important and that may be a formal religious community or some other sort of community. A lot of our religious or spiritual beliefs are expressed intrinsically. Meditation. Prayer. Relationship with God. Nature. Whatever. But there's also an extrinsic element that has to do with how a faith is practiced in the context of a community. That could be church, temple, or mosque. It might be a group of like-minded friends or an alternative spiritual group. This question about community has important practical implications because many times those are the people who will help a patient.\nFor example, I have a patient who is 88 years old and her husband is 93. He's dying, and she's not strong enough to lift him and do all of the caregiving. People from her church come almost every day and help them. This kind of community is a phenomenal resource. A fellow in geriatrics working with me was presenting the case to me, and he told me, \"They have no support! They don't have a social worker coming in. The home health aide comes maybe once a week. How is she managing?\" So I said, \"Well, have you asked about their spiritual history?\" Well, he did that and he came back and said, \"You know, in fact they're Catholic, and people from their church come in every day. It's an incredible support!\" Now, if he hadn't asked that question, he wouldn't have known that. Plus, the belief system is a support, too.\nThe fourth part of the assessment, which I call \"A,\" for application or address, leads to the part where I think, \"How is it that I can intervene in this situation or address these issues?\" For example, when patients are healthy and come in for a regular physical examination, they may tell me briefly about their belief systems. But spiritual issues don't really seem to be important, then I may not do anything with that content. But if someone comes in and says something that I hear as a warning sign, I might want to refer to a trained chaplain to help sort that out. For example, a person may see God as punitive and spiritual assessment may allow me to make a link between this attitude and the patient's not wanting to take medicines, or not taking care of him or herself. Or if someone's dying, spiritual concerns may be the only thing we talk about. I may bring a patient back the following week just to talk about these issues of life and death and how his or her spiritual beliefs affect any suffering the person may be feeling.\nI think the whole issue with end-of-life care is that many people say they do good palliative care, and what they define as good palliative care is being able to give narcotics and manage pain and other symptoms appropriately. While that's extraordinarily important, that's not the only aspect of suffering. Again, we tend to focus on the physical suffering-what we see in front of our eyes. But it is crucial to attend to the spiritual dimension of suffering, and it's distinct from emotional suffering.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Can you give an example to clarify that distinction?", "text": "A patient may be depressed, or may have anxiety, and while that may be related to spiritual suffering, it's not the whole picture. I have many people who are healthy emotionally, but who suffer tremendously spiritually. Here's a good example. A patient with several children was dying and the staff thought she was depressed, so they gave her medication for her depression, which only created new side effects. The medication didn't help alleviate her mood as they described it. I was called in to consult and went to go talk to her. I didn't find her depressed at all. She was just feeling that her life had no purpose and that she had nothing more to do in whatever time she had left. Her biggest concern was, \"My 2-year-old is not going to remember me.\" So we talked about what she could do to help her youngest daughter remember her. One tool is to write a legacy or a document where the patient articulates the things that are important to her and that she hopes to give to her daughter. What are the kinds of values she wants to impart to her daughter? So, for the next months, that's what she worked on. She wrote a legacy for her daughter which included things like, \"These are my hopes and dreams for you.\" In addition, one of the nurses videotaped her. This document and videotape then became a legacy, something her daughter could have as she grew up. With all of these activities to address her concerns about the meaning of her life, the \"depression\" lifted right away, without any medication.\nThere are other examples. I have patients in the nursing home who are not depressed or anxious. Yet there's something unsettled that you wouldn't necessarily be able to pick up on. But when asked, \"How are you doing?,\" they'll say, \"You know, I don't know.\" When I take a spiritual history, what comes out is, \"You know, I really believe in God, I've believed in God my whole life, but I'm really wondering if He's here for me right now. I'm feeling very abandoned by Him.\" But that doesn't necessarily result in a depression or an anxiety. It's just part of a spiritual journey, but it nevertheless causes spiritual distress. So with people like that, either I talk to them, or I refer to a chaplain who comes and works with them every day or every other day on those kinds of issues to help them sort it out. There's no magic fix. You can't give a pill for that, nor can you tell them, Oh, sure, God's there for you. Don't worry about it.\" You can't even give people an answer. However, you can listen and support them, and you can call on people who have particular training in this domain, such as trained chaplains, or spiritual directors, who can help patients work through this issue of God not being there for them and come to some kind of resolution.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "How did you get involved in thinking about spiritual issues as a physician?", "text": "I was a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I did a lot of basic research, which I found personally unfulfilling. So I started volunteering at a state mental hospital here in Maryland on the weekends. I worked with people with chronic mental illness. I saw a lot of spiritual distress, which was being overlooked. People who were able to find some sort of peace were the ones who were able to tap into that spiritual dimension in their lives. So when I went to medical school, I thought, \"Well, obviously, I'm go-ing to learn a lot about this.\" And I didn't. I saw nothing on spirituality. Even with something similar to alcoholism, there was nothing on 12step programs. Nothing. It was all very biomedical. I was amazed by that absence. In my own life, I also experienced the death of someone close to me, and so took part in bereavement groups and observed how other people deal with loss. I thought, \"Hmm. Nothing on that. Nothing on death and dying.\" So I started an elective course on spirituality and medicine back then, as a medical student at George Washington University. The other students loved this course. I remember one classmate of mine, who was Jewish. We rotated through Holy Cross, a Catholic hospital here in the Washington D.C. area, and he mentioned that at first he was very anxious about going to a Catholic hospital. He had this image of nuns and priests walking down the hall and of Catholicism being imposed on him. So he was delighted when, in fact, that wasn't his experience at all. Instead, he found that it was his favorite hospital because he experienced a sense of hope there.\nWe have since integrated the content of that course into the required curriculum at George Washington University. Now there are about 61 medical schools in the country that include some teaching about spirituality and medicine. Most of them have required courses on spirituality in medicine, based on the same model of integrating it throughout different courses.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "What about the issue of time?

There are questions about domestic violence, there's a sexual history, everything is in there. All of that is important, but you have to use your judgment. So clearly, if someone comes in with chest pains, I'm not going to sit there and ask him or her a spiritual history. If the patient is clutching his or her chest, I'm going to do a quick electrocardiogram and figure out what's going on. The patient may need rapid 134 PUCHALSKI AND ROMER intervention. On the other hand, if someone comes in for a regular physical, I would suggest addressing all these issues. It can be done in a brief amount of time. The FICA takes about 2 minutes. Spirituality is central to the care of the dying. When people are dying, the spiritual history is essential. I think if we don't address these issues with someone who comes in with a sore throat, that's okay. But if we don't ask about spiritual beliefs with someone who's dying, I think we're being really remiss in our duties.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Are you training physicians around the country to do this spiritual assessment? And are you targeting that training toward endof-life care because it seems to be such a vast area of need?", "text": "Yes. I don't want to say that I'm only targeting it to end-of-life care because it's so important across the whole spectrum. My interest is in endof-life care, so I tend to be in that circle of people. When I do give a presentation to clinicians working in end-of-life care, I present the spiritual history as something appropriate to do across the lifespan. A good analogy is with advance care planning, which we know shouldn't be done at the very end, either. Many advocates of advance care planning talk about doing advance care planning early on when the person is \"healthy.\" The nature of the conversation changes over time. So, too, for spiritual assessment. It may be for your 25-year old, perfectly healthy person on a routine physical, you ask a couple of questions, you jot it down, maybe it's an issue, maybe it isn't. But it's probably going to be the case if that person is suddenly faced with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or cancer or a chronic illness, those discussions are going to become more frequent.\nAnd these topics are related. I've found that when doing advance care planning, even under difficult circumstances with a patient I don't know well, that if I start by taking a spiritual history, the conversation changes. If a patient can't talk, I do a spiritual history with the family. Once I'm engaged in that conversation, it is so much easier to go into what gives that person meaning and purpose in life and how the patient might want to die, or under what circumstances. Most people are much more comfortable talking about end-of-life decisions in that context. So we focus a little more on spiri-tual concerns when I talk with people on endof-life issues.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Please describe the training you do.", "text": "Ideally, the workshop lasts about IV2 to 2 hours, because that gives people a time to roleplay and discuss and work in small groups, but I can do it in 45 minutes as well. I give a brief presentation on the assessment tool. I talk about why we do it; what the key issues are; how you look for what I would call \"positive\" versus \"negative\" spirituality. It's not that any spirituality is negative, but let me give you an idea of what spiritual symptoms might be. For example, if a patient has a concept of God as punitive, that might be linked to not being willing to continue treatment. Then I would discuss ways to deal with that issue.\nThen, I give some case examples, and I have people role-play with each other. If we have the longer period of time, we break up into smaller groups and discuss how that experience was and ways that they might integrate it in whatever their particular professions are. I do this with physicians, nurses, social workers, and others. Interdisciplinary groups are my favorite, because this kind of care doesn't belong in any one person's domain. So, the best workshops I've had included chaplains, physicians, nurses, social workers, licensed practical nurses, and home health care aides. When this happens, people across all of these roles end up interacting together, and particularly in the small-group discussion, they see how it might be different in each of their different professions as well as what they share. Then we come back into a large group and address issues about how the interview went and maybe share in the large group. That usually works pretty well. I try to follow up with people. I give a handout. Most people find that helpful. I'm now working in more detail on checklists that people can take back with them, because sometimes people forget the specifics.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Can you give me another example of what you're calling \"negative spirituality?\"", "text": "Some people have less mature relationships with God-similar to a four-year-old's relationship with a parent. What I mean here is that they have a very concrete and quid pro quo relationship. \"If I pray, God will cure me.\" If that doesn't happen, then their faith is challenged and SPIRITUAL HISTORY they can feel abandoned and despairing. I would suggest that spiritual support might allow a person to develop a more mature faith. What happens in the small group is that when people pair up to do a spiritual assessment, they come to recognize their own spirituality. I have some questions targeted to that experience in the small-group exercise. One of the things people often say is that you can't address a patient's spirituality until you address your own. I believe that. I don't think it's a \"prerequisite,\" because I think people are addressing it unconsciously. But I think it is important to be in touch with our own spirituality. It doesn't have to be formal, but there needs to be an awareness. There's actually been a lot done on this. Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, whom you may know, has written a book on spirituality and the healthcare provider. 2 Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen is coming out with a book on the call to service. She spoke at one of my conferences, and observed that in California where the managed care rates are the highest in the country, the physician suicide rates are also the highest, as well as the physician dropout rates for medicine. As a profession, one of the things we have to reclaim is our own spiritual roots, the calling to be a physician. It's not just a job. We're coming back to the beginning of the conversation where I said that bringing spirituality into the history changes the patient-doctor relationship. Once a physician starts engaging in these conversations with patients, he or she immediately becomes aware of that aspect inside him or herself, and, I think, becomes a more open and compassionate doctor as a result. I don't have data for that, but I can tell you from what patients and physicians have told me.\nPhysicians become more open and more compassionate. Patients also become more open and trusting. Often, opening up this conversation about purpose and meaning touches that part of the doctor that made him or her want to be a physician in the first place. I see being a physician as a spiritual calling. We put our patients' 135 needs above our own, that's one of the first things. We give of ourselves, we're available. We hold someone's hand or we walk through that journey with them, and unfortunately, the systems of healthcare right now are mitigating against that. But I think the profession really wants to recapture a lot of that domain. This is one of the reasons that spiritual assessment is so popular right now.\nSo it doesn't sound as though you've met much resistance from physicians to this training. Do you think that's because you're preaching to the converted?\nResistance is an interesting word. There is some resistance, and the resistance is when people have a preconceived notion that this is a Christian, right-wing kind of endeavor, which it isn't. When clinicians think that the spiritual assessment is going to be a platform for evangelizing doctors, to proselytize, then I sense resistance. Once I get beyond that, and they see that I'm not talking about a specific belief system, I think the resistance falls. Clearly the fact that there's some data now to suggest that spirituality is helpful, as well as the fact that there are so many courses, makes a big difference. Right now many medical schools offer courses on spirituality or faith and medicine. 3 The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) cosponsors a conference with the National Institute for Healthcare Research on spirituality and medicine every year, called Spirituality, Culture, and End-of-Life Care, which I have cochaired. Having the AAMC support work in this area gives it more credibility, too. I think the most important part is that, as a profession, we are beginning to recognize that the patient-centered approach is vital.

I've heard people say, \"This makes it approachable. This makes sense.\"\nJust last week I gave a presentation, and someone said at the very beginning, \"This is fine, but I bet it's going to be too long to do.\" Afterwards, he said, \"You mentioned you could do it in a short amount of time, and I was really surprised, but when I did it here, I could do it in 2 minutes.

I wanted to create something doctors or others could use at the beginning of the examination, something that would not constrain patients from leading the conversation into any area that was important to them.

This is going to be oversimplified for them.\" But in fact, it wasn't, and they found this short tool quite useful because it's not that easy to bring spiritual beliefs up in that context.

The patient is really educating you.\nHere is a twist on your question: Some healthcare providers have modified the FICA spiritual assessment tool to do a cultural assessment. So instead of the first question being, \"What is your faith or belief or do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?\" they have transformed it to, \"What's your cultural background? Tell me about it.\" The second question then becomes \"How im-portant is it? How does it influence you?\" So the tool seems quite flexible and adaptable to other domains such as cultural identity.\nOn the other hand, if someone were to say, \"Do you have a specific religion?

Method: Studies were identified using systematic database searches of MEDLINE (1966-1999), PsychLit , and Bath Information Data Service (BIDS) (1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999).

More than 100 individuals replied with details of articles, copies of reports or suggestions, although there was much overlap in the material. The reference lists of retrieved articles were scrutinized for relevant articles.

Articles were excluded if they consisted of personal opinion, case histories, service descriptions, discussion of ethical, legal, or educational issues, or were concerned only with the factors affecting place of care and not with preferences. We excluded studies of preferences among patients where none had cancer or where preferences for acute care were considered. Assessment of preference for place of care or place of death is assessed by surveys rather than randomized trials or comparative designs. Randomized trials are important in evaluating interventions, but do not determine preferences for care. However, the representativeness of the population studied and the method of determining a preference are critical to understand the generalisability of surveys. Therefore we prepared a hierarchy of evidence, based on response rate, and rigour of design and assessment (Table 1). This was used to grade the studies A (best) to C (worst). Data was extracted for a qualitative synthesis by one of us (G.S.) and checked independently by the other (I.H.) Grade A (fairly strong evidence) longitudinal study with standardized systematic and predefined assessment of preference for place of care or death, more than 80% response rate, patients not limited to those within one service, (e.g., one palliative care team). Grade B (moderate evidence) longitudinal study that does not meet criteria for A; cross-sectional, observational or retrospective study, more than 60% response rate, standardized and systematic assessment of preference for place of care or death. Grade C (weak evidence) Response rate less than 60% or not given or inconsistent assessment of preferences.\nThese grades are adapted for the methods encountered in this study from the Clinical Outcomes Group categories of evidence for use in the writing of clinical practice guidelines. 35 ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PLACE OF CARE IN ADVANCED CANCER", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "289", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESULTS", "text": "surgeries who had close experience of death and dying, reported a slightly lower home preference Nineteen studies were identified that reported (52% compared to 64%) and a higher preference preferences for place of care in advanced illness for hospice care (35%, compared to 16%) 10 comor at death.

The SF-36 and the SEIQOL-DW were assigned at random. Patients were examined at least three times at 2-month intervals. There was a significant decrease from visit 1 to 3 (4-month period) in the function-based values of the SIP, SF-36, and ALSFRS. Despite this progressive decline of physical function and HRQOL, individual QOL as assessed by the SEIQOL-DW remained stable throughout the observation period. Correspondingly, there was a clear correlation between the ALSFRS, the SIP, and the SF-36, but no correlation between these scales and the SEIQOL-DW. The QOL domains most often named in the SEIQOL-DW were family, friends/social life, health, and profession.

The mean survival time is approximately 3 to 5 years. Intellectual function and personality are usually preserved. 1 A curative therapy is still unavailable, but there are a large number of palliative treatment options. 2 Indeed, ALS can be considered a paradigm disease for neurologic palliative care. 3 Monitoring quality of life (QOL) in these patients is essential for assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the palliative treatment.\nDespite the severe and progressive paralysis of muscle function caused by ALS, it is a common clinical experience that a significant proportion of patients with ALS report an unexpectedly high level of personal well-being. 4 This often seems to be quite stable over time, despite disease progression. 5 This observation does not fit in the usual predetermined biomedical model of QOL assessment. 6 Conventionally, evaluation of so called \"health-related\" quality of life (HRQOL) is based on a fixed, standardized, external, and functiondominated value system. 7 Despite extensive psychometric studies, it is unclear whether these HRQOL-scales are actually relevant to individual patients. 6 Several authors have stressed the need to focus on the patients' own perspective of QOL, to prevent the risk of presumption and misleading conclusions, 8 especially in the treatment of terminally ill patients. In this context an influence of individual and existential aspects on the QOL of people with advanced disease has been discussed. 5,9,10 We have previously shown that a patient-generated measure of individual QOL, the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual QOL-Direct Weighting (SEIQOL-DW), is perceived by the patients as being more valid and less distressing than HRQOL measures such as the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) or the Short-Form 36 (SF-36). 11 Taken together, available data cast doubt on the ability of HRQOL questionnaires to adequately monitor individual aspects of QOL.

The SIP is a self-administered questionnaire that measures HRQOL based on sickness-related dysfunction. 14 It consist of 136 yes/no items describing illness-related disabilities in 12 physical or psychosocial subscales across a variety of dimensions. 15 The used time frame is today. The total scores were normalized to a 100-point scale. For better comparability the scale was reversed, so that higher scores reflect a higher HRQOL.\nShort Form-36.

It enables respondents to (1) nominate and describe the life areas (cues) that are important to their QOL; (2) rate their current level of functioning/satisfaction or contentment in each of these areas; and (3) rate the relative importance of each of their chosen cues.

In this study physical function (measured by the ALS-FRS) and HRQOL (measured by the SIP/ALS-19, an ALS-specific short version of the SIP) declined constantly, while the QOL assessed with the McGill Questionnaire, a scale that includes psychosocial, existential, and support aspects, was maintained over time. 5 The phenomenon of the \"well-being paradox\" seems therefore to be reproducible between countries, at least in the industrialized world. A possible reason for this observation could be a shift in factors determining QOL of severely affected terminally ill patients. The domains most often named in the SEIQOL-DW seem to reflect a response shift in form of a predominance of social and existential aspects of QOL, which appear to be largely independent from physical function. A similar observation was made in a North American group of patients with ALS and their caregivers using the SEIQOL-DW. In this survey only 34 % of areas of life nominated as most important by the patients were related to health and physical function. 22 In an ongoing study, we categorized SEIQOL-DW cues into existential (i.e., related to personal growth, transcendence, or purpose/meaning of life [9]) and nonexistential, and found that over 85% of the patients nominated at least one existential domain. 10 A caveat for the interpretation of our data comes from the imbalance at baseline between the subgroups studied, showing lower ALSFRS scores in the SF-36 group. However, the rate of decline over time was almost identical between groups for both the ALSFRS and the SIP, which argues in favour of comparability between the two subgroups.

Correspondingly, a high correlation between the SIP and the patients' muscular function testing was shown in a North-American cohort of patients with ALS. 24 In contrast, scales such as the SEIQOL-DW point out areas of life relevant for the patients that may constitute targets for psychosocial interventions. The development of appropriate coping strategies could enable patients to focus on those life domains and support factors which are more likely to sustain their QOL throughout disease progression. 5,23 This assumption is supported by another survey of an American group of patients with ALS that showed a significant correlation between the McGill QOL scale, an overall QOL-visual analogue scale, and existential, psychosocial, and support aspects. 4 Family and friends, which are mentioned most often in the SEIQOL-DW, appear to have the strongest impact on the QOL of patients with ALS, and should be recognized as a major focus for health care provision from the time of diagnosis.\nSymptom burden, psychological status, and disability level have all been reported to have an impact on QOL of patients with ALS. [25][26][27][28] Symptom control and interventions aimed at improving functional health status are essential components in the care of patients with ALS. In addition, our data indicate that nonphysical determinants of QOL play a major role in ALS and require careful assessment and management.\nThe fact that ALS is a rare neurologic disorder raises the question of generalizability of the results obtained in this model. Importantly, very similar data with regard to the distribution and weighting of QOL domains have been obtained in patients with advanced cancer. 6 Moreover, using the full version of the SEIQOL, which allows to assess internal reliability and validity of the responses, the highest scores for internal consistency were obtained in ALS and cancer patients, while patients with non-life-threatening illnesses and healthy controls scored markedly lower. 6,29 Thus, patients in a palliative situation, irrespective of the type of illness, seem generally to have a better idea of what is important to them than healthy individuals.\nBased on our experience with the QOL measures described in this study, we hypothesize that administering individual QOL scales such as the SEIQOL-DW to palliative care patients may have three positive interventional aspects: firstly, using an individual QOL measure might facilitate communication between physician and patient by pinpointing specific QOL issues for discussion. Second, the palliative care team could use the results of individual QOL instruments as a guideline for planning and focusing interventions.

Objectives: To describe and compare the end-of-life experience of persons dying with advanced dementia in the nursing home and home care settings. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Persons 65 years or older with advanced dementia who died within 1 year of admission to either a nursing home in Michigan between July 1, 1998 until December 31, 2000 (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 2730), or the state's publicly funded home and community-based services from October 1, 1998 until December 31, 2001 (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 290). Measurements: Data were derived from the Minimum Data Set (MDS)-Nursing home Version 2.0 for the institutionalized sample, and the MDS-Home Care for the community-based sample. Variables from the MDS assessment completed within 180 days of death were used to describe the end-of-life experiences of these two groups. Results: Nursing home residents dying with advanced dementia were older, had greater functional impairment, and more behavior problems compared to home care clients. Few subjects in the nursing home (10.3%) and home care (15.6%) cohorts were perceived to have less than 6 months to live. Only 5.7% of nursing home residents and 10.7% home care clients were referred to hospice. Hospitalizations were frequent: nursing home, 43.7%; home care, 31.5%. Pain and shortness of breath were common in both settings. End-of-life variables independently associated with nursing home versus home care included: hospice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.43), life expectancy less than 6 months (AOR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20-0.48), advance directives (AOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11-1.96), pain (AOR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.50), shortness of breath (AOR 0.20; 95% CI (0.13-0.28), and oxygen therapy (AOR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.51-4.05). Conclusions: Persons dying with advanced dementia admitted to nursing homes have different characteristics compared to those admitted to home care services. Their end-of-life experiences also differ in these two sites of care. However, palliative care was not optimal in either setting.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "B Y THE YEAR 2030, more than 13 million Americans will suffer with dementia, a progressive and incurable condition. 1 Recent work has shown that the site of death has important implications for the quality of terminal care. 2 Little is known about the end-of-life experience of persons dying with advanced dementia in different care settings.\nThe majority of individuals with advanced dementia receive their end-of-life care in nursing homes. [3][4][5][6] However, a substantial proportion of terminal care in dementia is provided in the community with home health services. [3][4][5][6] Many older persons prefer to stay at home as long as possible near the end-of-life. 7,8 Patients' preferences for the site of terminal care shift toward institutionalization when they feel that they can no longer receive adequate palliation in their homes and they are too burdensome for their families. 8 The unique care requirements in end-stage dementia can be particularly challenging for informal caregivers. 6 To promote informed decision-making regarding the site of terminal care, the experience of persons dying with advanced dementia across various settings needs to be better described. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine and contrast the end-of-life experience of severely demented individuals who died within one year of admission to either a nursing home or a community-based home care service. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a retrospective study using data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS).

[9][10][11][12] As well, Michigan has mandated the use of a compatible assessment system, the MDS-HC, 13 for use in its Michigan Choice Waiver for the Elderly and Disabled program.

Second, the palliative care provided to this population is not optimal in either setting: most patients are not recognized as dying, hospice referrals are infrequent, and hospitalizations, burdensome treatments, and potentially treatable distressing symptoms are common just prior to death. Finally, several palliative care outcomes in advanced dementia may be more favorable in the nursing home. Reported pain and shortness of breath were less common in the nursing home subjects compared to home care cohort, whereas advance directives and the use of oxygen therapy were more common in the nursing home setting. a All odds ratios are adjusted for age, race (white versus non-white), activities of daily living score on admission, days between admission and death, and Cognitive Performance Score (6 versus 5).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TERMINAL CARE FOR ADVANCED DEMENTIA 813", "text": "b Hospitalization and shortness of breath models also adjusted for presence of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nc Hospice models also adjusted for pain and shortness of breath.\nd Feeding tube model also adjusted for the presence of chewing and swallowing problems.\ne Oxygen therapy model also adjusted for the presence of shortness of breath and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nf Antianxiety medication model also adjusted for presence of behavior problems.\nCharacteristics on the last Minimum Data Set assessment prior to death of older persons with advanced dementia cared for in a nursing home (n \u03ed 2730) versus at home (n \u03ed 290).\nFew previous studies have described the endof-life experience of older persons with advanced dementia in various care settings. [3][4][5][6]18,20,21 Our study corroborates earlier observations that persons with advanced dementia admitted to nursing homes have a greater skilled nursing needs compared to those who are managed at home. In particular, behavior problems and functional disability are consistently associated with institutionalization at all stages of dementia. 5,22 Our study further supports growing expert opinion and empiric data suggesting that palliative care for advanced dementia is sub-optimal across all care settings including nursing homes, 4,5,18 hospitals, 20,21 assisted living/residential facilities, 4 and home. 3,5,6 Advanced dementia is often not recognized as a terminal illness. 18,20,21 Moreover, it is uncommon for persons dying with end-stage dementia to be referred to hospice. 5,[23][24][25] The smaller proportion of hospice referrals in the nursing home may further reflect practical barriers related to contracting hospice services in nursing facilities, or the perception by nursing home staff that additional palliative care expertise is not needed. Hospice services in nursing homes have been shown to improve pain management, promote advance care planning, and reduce the use of invasive treatments. 26,27 Moreover, older persons receiving home hospice have been shown to have a better dying experience compared to those receiving terminal care in a nursing home or at home with nursing services. 2 Many family members and health care providers feel palliation should be the primary goal of care for persons with advanced dementia. 28 We have shown, as have others, that potentially treatable distressing symptoms are common among persons dying with advanced dementia. [4][5][6]18 Our finding that 53.4% of home care clients had daily or almost daily pain, is similar to the proportion reported by family caregivers of persons dying with dementia (62.6%). 6 Pain is often underreported in advanced dementia when assessed with standard pain scales and MDS items. 29,30 Therefore, the number of subjects suffering with pain may even be higher than reported. It is notable that nursing home residents were more likely to receive oxygen therapy and had less reported shortness of breath compared to the home care cohort. Oxygen therapy would be considered reasonable treatment to manage terminal dyspnea associated with hypoxemia. As such, our finding supports earlier work suggesting that palliative treatments may be more readily available in an institutionalized setting. 4 The avoidance of burdensome hospital admissions is another theoretical advantage of the nursing homes' ability to provide the 24-hour care. We found, as have others [3][4][5][6]20,21 that hospitalizations are very common for persons with advanced dementia, regardless of care setting.\nThis study has some limitations that deserve comment. First, our data describe the patients' experience in the primary setting where they were cared for near the end-of-life, but not necessarily at the location of death. Second, there may be some inaccuracies in the recording MDS data. The potential for misclassification is minimized by uniform data collection by trained staff and explicitly defined variables in a coding manual. While most misclassification is likely to be nondifferential between the home care and nursing home settings, there may be some reporting bias of symptoms in our two cohorts. For example, nursing home staff may be more reluctant to report pain, one of several MDS quality indicators used to rate nursing homes nationwide. Third, although we examined a well-defined cohort with advanced dementia and used multivariate techniques, we may not have adjusted for all the clinical differences between the home care and nursing home cohorts to explain our findings. Fourth, many important end-of-life outcomes are not captured in the MDS, including family satisfaction with end-of-life care and the process of shared decision-making. Fifth, 12% of the nursing home residents who died within a year of admission were excluded because a full MDS assessment was not completed within 180 days of death. Although these residents were similar to those who met inclusion criteria at the time of admission, it is possible that these groups differed with respect to their end-of-life experience. Finally, our data are limited to the state of Michigan and may not be generalizable to other states where home care services and nursing home care differ.\nMany factors influence the location of terminal care for persons with advanced dementia including patient preferences and care needs, availability of formal and informal services, financial resources, and caregiver burden. As patients, families and practitioners weigh these varying influences, it behooves the health care community to improve the care of those dying with this condi-tion in whichever care setting they ultimately spend their final days. This study underscores the need to promote better palliative care in advanced dementia in the home and nursing home settings.", "n_publication_ref": 43, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Supported by the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged (HRCA) Research and Training Institute, the Marcus Applebaum Fund at the HRCA, the Harvard Older American Independence Center Grant (AG08812) from the National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD and InterRAI.

In recent years palliative care programs have been established in acute care hospitals for assessing and managing of these symptoms and to assist patients and families in planning end-of-life care. 3,4 One of the major challenges in the development of hospice and palliative care in the United States and other countries has been the relatively late referral of patients during the course of the patients' terminal illnesses to these predominantly community-based programs. 5,6 One expectation of palliative care programs based in acute care hospitals would be that they are capable of integrating palliative care interventions earlier in the trajectory of illness.\nThe palliative care program at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center was established in October 1999. The main goal of this program is to provide sophisticated assessment of physical and psychosocial symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. This program consists of a group of full time palliative care specialist who provide consultations in all areas of the cancer center, and outpatient consult service and inpatient palliative care unit for symptom stabilization and discharge of severely distressed patients. Because there is no direct admission to the palliative care unit and a small number of patients are referred initially as outpatients, the majority of the consults reported in this study were conducted by the inpatient consult team. At the time of referral, patients are not enrolled in the hospice program are therefore completely managed by the palliative care program.

Patients were assessed in an outpatient center, the emergency center, or the different inpatient services within the hospital. The patient population included all patients who were assessed by a full-time faculty member from the palliative care program. Inpatients were followed up by one of the palliative care physicians' daily until patient's discharge or death. Outpatients were given the opportunity for follow-up usually within 1 week.\nThe information collected from charts included patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity); the location and type of cancer (solid tumor or hematologic malignancies); the main symptoms upon referral; and the times from the diagnosis of the primary cancer to death, from the diagnosis of advanced cancer (the first consult in which the patient was found to have locally recurrent and/or metastatic cancer) to death, from the diagnosis of advanced cancer to palliative care referral, from palliative care referral to death.\nThe date of death was obtained from the hospital tumor registry and ascertained using administrative records. Patients who at the time of final data analysis were not known to be dead were classified into three groups: (1) patients demonstrated to be alive (base on contact with the hospital registration within the last month);\n(2) patients known to have been referred to hospice and therefore presumed to have died within 1 month 7,8 ; (3) patients lost to follow-up by the date of chart review.

Previous research found that patients with hematologic malignancies die more frequently in hospitals. 12,13 One possible explanation for the higher number of hospital deaths and later referral to palliative care is the presence of more therapeutic options and the absence of reliable clinical indicators of refractory disease in hematologic patients. In addition, side effects of aggressive treatments, such as high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, commonly result in hospitalization and have a considerable association with mortality.\nOur results suggest that pain, fatigue, depression/anxiety, and anorexia are the most common findings among patients with advanced cancer referred to palliative care programs. These findings are consistent with previous reports.

Interval between advanced cancer to death in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\nquest referrals to palliative care because of limited understanding of these programs, and in most centers, there are no standardized criteria for palliative care referrals. 18 Previous research suggests that primary physicians who are familiar with palliative care make earlier palliative care referrals as compared to those with limited or no palliative care experience, 19,20 especially in the case of hematologists. 21 One way to promote earlier referral will be through intensive education among referring physicians and nurses. Their education should focus on the ability of the palliative care team to control severe symptoms, 3,16 and on the importance of initiating care early or a way of promoting a seamless transition to end of life care.\nWe found that the interval between palliative care referral and death was longer among younger patients (Fig. 4, Table 4). There are a number of possible reasons for this observation, including shorter survival in palliative care for older, more debilitated patients, 13,22 or earlier referral of younger patients, perhaps because of increased physical or psychosocial distress. These CHENG ET AL. 1030 possible explanations should be addressed in future research. This study has a number of limitations. Because of its retrospective nature, we were not able to determine if the referral to the palliative care program resulted in any lessening of patients' physical and psychosocial distress. It is also not possible to establish the main reasons why patients were referred relatively late in the trajectory of their illness. These issues should be addressed in future prospective studies. It would be interesting to assess whether the interval between the onset of advanced cancer and palliative care referral shortens as palliative care programs become better integrated and accepted into the culture of cancer care programs.\nAfter 9 months of follow-up, approximately one third of the data were censored. It is also risky to assume that patients referred to hospice should be presumed to be dead within one month. However, this group of patients was very small and we had unpublished data from our hospice referrals reporting a median survival among our patients was approximate 9 days. Only 9% of patients were lost to follow-up and therefore it is unlikely that a longer follow up would result in a significant change in the observed intervals.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "We conclude that referrals to palliative care at comprehensive cancer centers occur mostly near the end of life.

We evaluated data regarding 592 consecutive patients consulted by the palliative care service between November 2000, through March 2002. Standardized medical record reviews indicated that over 90% of interventions recommended by the palliative care team were accepted and acted on by the primary team; audit of the medical records of 368 patients confirmed that pain and other symptoms improved in 87% of patients after palliative care intervention. Ninety-five percent of respondents to a telephone survey of family caregivers described themselves as likely to recommend the service to others. High levels of referring provider satisfaction were evidenced by a Likert-scale provider satisfaction survey and an increase in the rate of referral for palliative care consultation from 2% to 21% of all patients dying at our medical center during the study period. There were also significant reductions in charges for ancillary tests and ventilator charges after palliative care consultation. A matched case control study of mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated significant savings in hospital charges (n \u03ed 160 pairs).

There was a broad base of referring physicians and reasons for referral, and interventions were diverse.\nMany of the individual aspects of this composite evaluation, however, are not robust and fraught with potential for errors but may serve nevertheless as exploratory methods for the evaluation of the benefits of a palliative care service in its start-up phase.\nThe data presented in this report have some important limitations. While the data gathered with the standardized chart abstraction tool allowed us to evaluate outcomes for a relatively representative subset of patients these data should be interpreted with caution because of potential systematic bias on the part of clinicians in rating symptoms. The palliative Care clinicians' assessment of the implementation of recommendations could also potentially have been open to bias. Current program evaluation measures include patient rated measures such as the Missoula Vitas Quality of Life instrument and the Palliative care Outcomes Scale. 3 Family caregiver ratings of pain and other symptoms have been described in the literature as being more reliable than that of professional caregivers but still underrates the severity of symptoms in comparison with direct reports by patients. 4 Relatively few providers responded to the provider satisfaction survey (10%) and less than half of surveyed family members completed the caregiver survey. Satisfaction levels for referring providers who complete the provider questionnaire can be expected to be higher than for nonrespondents. The caregiver survey was completed by a relatively small percentage of families who received service from the PCS. The aggregate length of stay analyses included in this report was not adjusted for diagnostic groups, survival status, or site of care. Concerning the impact of the PCS on resource utilization it is possible that sicker palliative care patients were compared to healthier control patients. Unfortunately in the absence of appropriate adjustment for severity of illness we cannot determine the extent of this mismatch. a Cases were patients on ventilators who died during the index visit and were seen by the palliative care service.

Combined Post Intervention charges were significantly lower for the case cohort compared with the control cohort (p \u03ed 0.008).\nThe median time to consultation from admission to the medical center for patients dying at the medical center with palliative care appropriate diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) has been incorporated as a process measure in the medical center's quality improvement reports. Current strategies in place to improve on this measure include a palliative care and case management initiative in the medical center's emergency department and a palliative care project in the medical intensive care unit.\nFurther work will include the adaptation of existing quality-of-life instruments and identification of those portions of qualitative interviews that correlate most with satisfaction or lack of satisfaction with quality of care, and integration of these items into the medical record to facilitate earlier recognition of physical and psychosocial stressors for our patients. Those data will be used to focus educational activities on the aspects of symptom distress and impaired quality-of-life that are now least impacted by the provision of palliative care services.

As physicians, we can be the primary cause of suffering in their last weeks of life, or the primary cause of its relief. 2 Which role we choose depends on both our knowledge of terminal care and our approach to it. Experience suggests that we have at our disposal the tools to make every death better, at least marginally. A comfortable death is possible for almost all of our patients. It should be one of our primary obligations, and one of our patients' primary expectations.\nAs Sherwin Nuland noted in How We Die, there is a vast literature on dying but few reliable accounts of the process. In part because of the ethical and legal issues associated with clinical trials involving dying patients, there is little controlled research on which to base our practice. For example, benzodiazepines have not been shown to be beneficial in palliative care patients, but most of us would find it difficult to do effective end-of-life care without them. Likewise, corticosteroids might or might not be effective for malignant bowel obstruction; the meta-analysis of trials investigating their use lacked statistical significance. 3 Useful data does exist, however, although much is retrospective or extrapolated from patients in earlier stages of illness. In general, the same palliative approaches and treatments used in earlier stages of the dying process are felt to be effective in terminal care. Until better research becomes available, we must rely heavily on this incomplete data, personal experience, and expert opinion to guide the care for our patients at the end of life.\nTerminal care refers to medical care provided in the last days to weeks of life. For this discussion, an extensive review of systematic research related to death, terminal care, and bereavement published from 1990 through April 2004, and available on MEDLINE was performed. Where reliable data were not available, reference was made to current expert opinion derived from review articles, textbooks, and other published sources.

Approximately 50% will die in hospitals, 25% at home, and 25% in nursing homes. Significant geographic variation in these rates exists, however. Even among leading hospitals, the rates of in-hospital Medicare deaths range from 16% to 55%. 4 Nationwide, the proportion of patients dying in hospitals is declining, while the proportions dying at home and in nursing homes are increasing (Table 2). Teno 5 estimates that by 2040, the proportion dying in nursing homes may approach 50%.\nMost Americans want to die at home. Oncology population surveys indicate the proportion preferring a home death is almost 90%, and opinion surveys have documented similar findings in the general public. 7 Social factors may affect these preferences, however. A survey of recently hospitalized elderly patients with life-limiting disease revealed more wanted their terminal care in the hospital than at home (48% versus 43%). The primary reasons given for preferring hospital over home care were their concerns about being a burden to family and their family's ability to provide necessary care. Most preferred nurs-  166 ing home to hospital care when given that choice. 8 Only one third of terminally ill patients with cancer achieve their preferred place of death. 9 Those who die at home are disproportionately white, educated, married, female, and enrolled in hospice or PACE programs. They tend to have longer survival after cancer diagnosis and a functional decline over less than 5 months (more prolonged decline predicts nursing home placement).

Hospitals traditionally are more focused on curative than palliative care, and regulatory, staffing, and privacy issues make effective end-of-life care in nursing facilities difficult. 15,16 Patients in these settings commonly have significant unmet care needs. Of the families of patients who died in a nursing home, 32% felt the patient's pain was not adequately addressed and 56% felt emotional support of the patient was lacking. Of the families of patients who died in a hospital, 50% thought communication was a problem, 51% wanted more physician contact, and 80% thought the patient was not always treated with respect. 17 Isolation in institutions is another pervasive problem. Sulmasy and Rahm 18 found that seriously ill hospitalized patients with poor prognoses spent on average over 18 hours per day alone. Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders did, however, significantly increase the time nurses spent with these patients. 19 Predictors of death in a nursing home include prolonged functional decline, poor performance status, and increased age. 10 Unfortunately, many dying nursing home residents are transferred un-necessarily to hospitals. Enrollment in hospice or having an advance directive, however, significantly decreases the risk of this \"terminal transfer.\" 20,21 Institutional end-of-life care measures can be improved by hospital-based palliative care programs and nursing home hospice programs. 22,23 Likewise, institutional systematic integrated care protocols have been shown to improve symptom control during the last two days of life. 24 ", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DEATH AND HOSPICE", "text": "Hospice services for terminal care have been available in the United States since 1974 and have been funded by Medicare since 1983.

The median length of stay in U.S. hospices fell from 29 days in 1995 to 20.5 days in 2001, rising slightly to 22 days in 2003. Approximately 37% of hospice patients die within a week of enrollment, and only 7% survive more than 6 months. 25 There has been a concurrent trend toward more aggressive medical treatment near death. In 1996, 19% of Medicare cancer patients receiving chemotherapy received it in their last 2 weeks of life, up significantly from 14% in 1993. 26 Although inhospital death rates are declining, intensive care unit (ICU) and intensive procedure use is increasing. Between 1985 and 1999, Medicare patients with at least one ICU admission in their last 6 months of life increased from 31% to 35%, and the proportion having an intensive procedure during their last hospitalization increased from 18% to 30%. 27 In 2001, 14.4% of Medicare patients spent more than a week in an ICU during their last 6 months, up from 13.1% in 1999. 28 Goodlin et al. 29 found that even during the last 2 days of life, 27% of hospitalized patients received ventilatory support, 18% were restrained, and 12% had an attempted resuscitation.

Evidence does show that physicians consistently overestimate patient survival, and those most familiar with the patient are often the least accurate. 32,33 One observational study in terminally ill patients with cancer noted that patients on average developed respirations with mandibular movement 8 hours, acrocyanosis 5 hours, and radial pulselessness 3 hours before death but there was wide individual variation, with most patients developing these symptoms less than 2.5 hours before they died. Decreased consciousness was identified in 84% at 24 hours and 92% at 6 hours prior to death. 34 Development of a death rattle is predictive of death within 48 hours but typically occurs in less than half of patients. 35 With the exceptions of drowsiness, fatigue, and confusion, symptoms in patients with cancer followed at home tended to improve in the last days of life. 36 According to expert opinion, other symptoms of near death include becoming bedbound, irregular breathing, tolerating sips of fluid only, and cool or mottled extremities. 37,38 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PLONK AND ARNOLD 1044", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMON TERMINAL SYMPTOMS", "text": "Distressing physical symptoms are common at the end of life.

McCann and colleagues 55 found that 97% of dying patients who stopped eating experienced no hunger or hunger only initially. Anorexia and cachexia (sometimes referred to as wasting syndromes) appear to be due in part to proinflammatory cytokines and other humoral factors which, by inducing catabolism, may help explain the failure of artificial feeding to improve nutritional parameters in chronically ill patients. 56,57 It has been proposed that terminal anorexia actually may benefit dying patients by inducing a ketosis that contributes to a sense of well-being and diminished discomfort. 58 Because of its beneficial effects on cell metabolism, \u2424-hydroxybutyrate, the primary ketone in starvation, has even", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TERMINAL CARE 1045", "text": "been suggested as a therapeutic agent. 59 While an attractive theory, evidence for the clinical benefit of ketosis in dying patients is limited. The provision of artificial hydration and nutrition (AHN) in terminal care remains a heavily debated clinical, ethical, legal, and religious issue. Clinical evidence for the benefit of artificial nutrition in end-of-life care is poor. In a 1999 review, Finucane et al. 54 found no evidence that tube feeding in patients with advanced dementia prevented aspiration pneumonia, prolonged survival, reduced the risk of pressure sores or infections, improved function, or provided comfort. More recent studies have confirmed this lack of benefit in advanced dementia. [60][61][62] A meta-analysis of studies of both enteral and parenteral nutrition in patients with metastatic cancer found that neither therapy affected morbidity or mortality. 63 Enteral feeding tubes have, however, been associated with increased complication rates, restraint use, and emergency department utilization. 64,65 Such evidence has led Winter to argue that unrequested nutritional support of the terminally ill is both medically and ethically indefensible. 53 Most authorities consider the discontinuation of tube feedings to be ethically and legally indistinguishable from their initiation. 66,67 Nevertheless, artificial nutritional support is typically the last life-sustaining measure withdrawn, and approximately 25% of demented nursing home patients die while still receiving tube feedings. 68,69 The data surrounding hydration in dying patients are more controversial. Some studies correlate dehydration with adverse symptoms such as thirst, [70][71][72] and some experts argue that parenteral hydration prevents and treats some cases of terminal delirium. 73,74 Other authorities argue that the data does not support a correlation between dehydration and symptoms and that rehydration does not improve patient comfort. 58,75 One retrospective study suggested a decrease in agitated delirium with routine parenteral hydration, but a more recent follow-up study failed to confirm this finding. 76,77 Two 1997 literature reviews on this issue reached opposite conclusions, but both agreed the data were inconsistent. 74,78 As with anorexia, some authorities feel that dehydration in fact may improve comfort by inducing uremia, hyperosmolality, and endorphin release. 79,80 They point out that patients with endstage renal disease who stop dialysis typically experience less discomfort than patients who die of other causes, with 85% experiencing a \"good\" death requiring minimal medical intervention. 81 As with ketosis, however, additional evidence for this benefit is scarce.\nFinally, some authorities have argued that intravenous hydration may have numerous adverse effects including worsening edema, increasing secretions, and unnecessarily prolonging the dying process. 58 Fewer diuretics (and smaller fluid volumes) were used in patients receiving hypodermoclysis than those with intravenous fluids, but no randomized trials of parenteral hydration methods have been conducted. 82 While there is little objective evidence of harm, the bulk of current evidence and expert opinion supports the conclusion that parenteral hydration is likely not beneficial in the actively dying patient.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESPIRATORY CHANGES", "text": "Though the true etiology is unknown, changes in breathing are thought to indicate significant neurologic compromise near death. Diminished tidal volume, apneic periods, accessory muscle use, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations often develop, and reflex breaths may immediately precede death. These breathing changes can be very distressing for family and caregivers, who may fear the patient is suffocating. 58 The development of hypercarbia may induce a beneficial narcosis, although again there are few data to support this conjecture. In fact, some studies suggest normocarbia with progressive hypoxia induces the least agitation. 83 Oxygen administration likely provides no benefit in this setting but has not been studied and is widely used to address family and caregiver concerns. 84 The treatment of breathlessness is, however, one of the few areas of palliative care for which we have solid evidence, and seems reasonable to assume this data can be extrapolated to the terminal phase. A recent Cochrane review confirmed the benefit of oral and parenteral opioids in improving breathlessness and dyspnea in palliative care patients. 85,86 Nebulized opioids, although attractive as a means of treating breathlessness while limiting side effects, showed no benefit over nebulized saline in the Cochrane analysis. Three recent reviews by different authors support the use of oral or parenteral (but not nebulized) opioids in the palliation of dyspnea even in patients with severe underlying lung PLONK AND ARNOLD 1046 disease. [87][88][89] Opioids also appear to relieve breathlessness in stable severe congestive heart failure (CHF) but showed no benefit in stable severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease. 90,91 Although they are widely used, there is limited objective evidence for the benefit of benzodiazepines in the palliation of breathlessness. 92,93 Oxygen appears to benefit patients with terminal cancer with hypoxemia but was no better than room air in nonhypoxemic dyspneic patients. 94,95 A fan blowing air on the face is thought to improve breathlessness through stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, although the evidence for this effect in humans is unclear.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACCUMULATION OF RESPIRATORY TRACT SECRETIONS", "text": "The accumulation of respiratory tract secretions (ARTS), presumably caused by a declining gag reflex and decreased reflexive clearing, may occur as death approaches and lead to gurgling respirations. This \"death rattle\" occurs in one fourth to one half of dying patients, occurs more commonly in men and patients with brain and lung neoplasms, and predicts most (76% in one study) will die within 48 hours. 34,96 Nonpharmacologic interventions such as discontinuing parenteral fluids, repositioning, and postural drainage are frequently recommended but have not been studied systematically. Oropharyngeal suctioning is considered generally ineffective for this condition and may cause both patient and family discomfort. 58 A majority (50%-80%) of patients with ARTS respond to treatment with antimuscarinics, though one author contrasts treatment-responsive \"real death rattle\" resulting from unexpectorated secretions from treatment-resistant \"pseudo-death rattle\" caused by pulmonary pathology. 34 Subcutaneous hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) was more immediately effective in one trial than subcutaneous glycopyrrolate but glycopyrrolate has a longer duration of action.

In 1990, Ventafridda et al. 104 argued that pain usually escalated near death, requiring palliative sedation in more than half of patients. Numerous systematic studies since then, however, have shown that overall pain tends to decline in the dying phase. Fainsinger et al. 105 noted a decrease in pain on a visual analogue scale over the last week of life. Ellershaw et al. 24 documented a decrease in uncontrolled pain from 18% at 24 hours to 8% at 4 hours prior to death without opioid dose changes. Mercadante et al. 106 found that pain and opioid use in patients dying at home peaked about one month prior to death. The etiology of this overall decline is unknown, although uremia, ketosis, and the build-up of endorphins or exogenous opioid metabolites may contribute.\nExpert consensus holds that some dying patients, perhaps 1%-2%, do develop \"crescendo\" pain in the last hours or days of life, though delirium may be a contributing factor. 107,108 While this subset of terminal pain has not been studied systematically, opioid rotation, intravenous ketamine, and palliative sedation have shown benefit in various case studies. 109,110 Each opioid is felt to influence a unique distribution of receptors that become downregulated over time; rotation to a different opioid is thought to improve pain control by altering the receptor set affected. Similarly, ketamine is felt to affect alternate pain receptors. One small randomized trial did show that continuing the use of transdermal fentanyl in the terminal phase improved overall pain control, though this is likely an opioid class effect. 111 Interestingly, the stress of dying (as measured by postmortem cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] cortisol levels) is not suppressed by either high-dose opioids or the presence of dementia. 112 This finding suggests that it may be our ability to assess pain, rather than the pain itself, that declines during the terminal phase. The assessment of cognitively impaired patients has been studied extensively in dementia, but there remains significant debate on whether cognitive status influences pain perception. 113,114 Similar issues confound the assessment of pain in dying patients with cognitive decline. Half of patients with advanced cancer are unable to use common pain assessment tools. 115 Caregiver perception may not be accurate either, because they tend to overestimate the symptom intensity of dying patients and their assessment of the patient's pain TERMINAL CARE 1047 may be influenced substantially by their own experience. 116,117 Numerous scales to assess discomfort in nonverbal patients have been developed and validated for use in dementia, but the utility of these scales in the objective assessment of dying patients has not been studied. 118,119 Nonpharmacologic approaches to terminal discomfort such as careful oral and eye care, use of urinary catheters, and bed cushioning are recommended empirically by most authorities. Alternative interventions such as music therapy, aromatherapy, and massage are likewise considered useful by many but also are without clear evidence of benefit. Existential and psychosocial pain have been well described but poorly studied in the terminal care population. Caregiver interviews suggest they can cause or reinforce physical pain, just as physical pain may sometimes present as global suffering. 120,121 Some observers have questioned the use of high-dose opioids in terminal care, pointing out the potential for adverse side effects, especially sedation and respiratory depression. While higher opioid doses are associated with these signs, there is no evidence that they are associated with increased mortality. 122 ", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TERMINAL DELIRIUM", "text": "Delirium, characterized by fluctuating disturbances in consciousness, cognition, and perception, occurs in 28% to 83% of patients near the end of life. 123 Terminal delirium, often associated with signs of decreased perfusion, is commonly divided into three types: hyperactive (with restlessness, agitation, or hallucinations), hypoactive (with somnolence), and mixed (with alternating features of both). 124 It is usually presumed to be multifactorial and often is confused with sedation, dementia, or near-death awareness. When frequent, both the psychomotor and cognitive symptoms of hyperactive delirium are distressing to the majority of families and may become major obstacles to effective end-of-life care. 122,125 A study in nonactively dying cancer patients found that while hyperactive delirium was more distressing to caregivers, both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium were equally distressing to patients. 126 One recent observational study found that psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) occurred in 35% of dying patients. These experiences may be either distressing or comforting, may have significant psychological importance for patients or their families, and, if not distressing, may not require treatment. 120,127 Hospice nurses have noted that some dying patients use symbolic language or gestures to describe their experiences or request needs, and these messages may be misunderstood and medicalized as delirium. 128 The moaning, groaning, and grimacing that often accompany delirium may also be misinterpreted as physical pain. 58 Experts feel that poor pain management may precipitate terminal delirium (after hip fracture, delirium is more commonly caused by pain than by pain medications) 129 but that uncontrollable pain rarely develops near death if it has not previously been a problem. Increasing opioid dosing or rotating opioids, therefore, may be reasonable options for the treatment of terminal delirium if pain control is questionable, but the data on these interventions is conflicting. 58,76,77 While nonpharmacologic interventions effective for delirium in other settings (including visual and hearing aids, reorientation, therapeutic activities, sleep enhancement, and mobilization) may be useful in terminal delirium, no controlled trials have been conducted. 122 While reversible factors such as psychoactive medications, metabolic disarray, or infection may be identified in up to half of cases, terminal delirium management typically focuses on symptom control with medications. 72,130 Lorazepam (oral, buccal, or intravenous) is widely used with good anecdotal success. 58 Haloperidol proved superior to lorazepam in one small randomized controlled trial in hospitalized patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with delirium, and other typical and atypical antipsychotics have shown benefit in treating delirium with dementia, but it is unclear how these results translate to the treatment of actively dying patients. 131,132 Two recent reviews of pharmacologic therapy for terminal delirium found the best evidence for haloperidol and chlorpromazine but concluded that benzodiazepines, antipsychotics (typical and atypical), and phenothiazines appeared to be equally effective. 133,134 ", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PALLIATIVE SEDATION", "text": "In a small minority of cases, multiple agents are ineffective for severe symptom control and patients require palliative (or \"terminal\") sedation. Midazolam, propafol, or barbiturates are commonly PLONK AND ARNOLD 1048 used for this purpose because of their ability to be rapidly titrated to effect but there are no data to support using one over the others. 123,135 The ethics of palliative sedation are complex. To what extent it departs from usual palliative care and approaches euthanasia continues to be widely debated. 136 Most experts, however, argue it is legally and ethically appropriate in cases of physical or emotional suffering uncontrollable by other means, and it is widely used internationally. [137][138][139] Palliative sedation has not been shown to decrease overall survival, so the commonly evoked ethical doctrine of double effect (life shortening is acceptable if the intent is suffering relief) does not apply in its use. 140 Concerns regarding its potential overuse have been raised, however. In one study, some Japanese palliative care units used terminal sedation in more than half of their patients, and it was used more often by those physicians less experienced in end-oflife care. 141,142 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CAREGIVER STRESS AND BEREAVEMENT", "text": "Recognizing and addressing family and caregiver stress during the last weeks of life is a critical role of the palliative care physician. 38 Surveys indicate 20% of caregivers provide full-time or constant care, 20% quit work or make major life changes, and 31% lose most or all of their savings. Caregiver stress increases risks in the caregiver of insomnia, depression, cancer, and death. 143 Higher stress levels are associated with dying at home, increased patient distress, increased patient dependence, and increased caregiver burden. 144,145 Despite all preparation, the time of death is often challenging. Experts recommend reviewing with caregivers in advance the expected dying process, the signs of death, and death notification arrangements. 58 The effectiveness of such discussions, however, has not been studied systematically. Respect for personal preferences, religious practices, and cultural traditions is also strongly recommended. 146,147 Caregiver stress may not resolve with the loved one's death. 148,149 Bereavement often worsens physical and mental health and increases the risks of depression, insomnia, suicide, substance abuse, and death. 150 Complicated bereavement has been associated with the death of a child or spouse, sud-den death, high caregiver stress or burden, younger age, female gender, preexisting psychological symptoms, and limited social support. [151][152][153] A decreased risk has been associated with caregiver support before death and death at home. 149,154,155 In one retrospective study, hospice length of stay was not associated with improved bereavement at 6 months, but a more recent prospective study showed caregivers enrolled in hospice for 3 days or less had a significantly increased risk of major depression at 6-8 months compared to those with longer hospice stays. 156,157 Hospice involvement also has been shown to significantly decrease the mortality at 18 months of bereaved wives. 158 While counseling and antidepressants are widely used, reviews of the treatment of complicated bereavement have shown no clear benefit of these interventions. 159,160 Communication with family and other caregivers after death is appreciated and may improve bereavement outcomes. 161,162 Several recent consensus treatment guidelines for physicians on bereavement have been published. 143,151,163 Excellent communication is essential during the dying process. Bereaved families identified improved communication around the time of death as the single most important means of improving end-of-life care. 164 One quarter of families across care locations expressed concerns specifically with physician communication during terminal care. 17 Physician empathy as death approached has been shown to reduce caregiver depression and psychosocial burden. 165 ", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Our last days can be either our best or our worst.

Objective: To quantify the growth of hospital based palliative care programs from 2000-2003 and identify hospital characteristics associated with the development of a palliative care program. Design and measurements: Data were obtained from the 2001-2004 American Hospital Association Annual Surveys which covered calendar years 2000-2003. We identified all programs that self-reported the presence of a hospital-owned palliative care program and acute medical and surgical beds. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify characteristics significantly associated with the presence of a palliative care program in the 2003 survey data. Results: Overall, the number of programs increased linearly from 632 (15% of hospitals) in 2000 to 1027 (25% of hospitals) in 2003. Significant predictors associated with an increased likelihood of having a palliative care program included greater numbers of hospital beds and critical care beds, geographic region, and being an academic medical center. Compared to notfor-profit hospitals, VA hospitals were significantly more likely to have a palliative care program and city, county or state and for-profit hospitals were significantly less likely to have a program. Hospitals operated by the Catholic Church, and hospitals that owned their own hospice program were significantly more likely to have a palliative care program than non-Catholic Church-operated hospitals and hospitals without hospice programs respectively. Conclusions: Our data suggest that although growth in palliative care programs has occurred throughout the nation's hospitals, larger hospitals, academic medical centers, not-for-profit hospitals, and VA hospitals are significantly more likely to develop a program compared to other hospitals.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A LTHOUGH SURVEYS of healthy adults suggest that most would like to die at home, 1 and despite the rapid growth of the hospice industry in the United States since 1982 when the Medicare Hospice Benefit was enacted, most Americans still die in hospitals. In 2004, more than 50% 2,3 of Americans with serious illness died in an acute care hospital and more than 90% of Medicare beneficiaries will be hospitalized in the year prior to death. 4 In recognition of the importance hospitals play in the care of persons with serious and advanced illness, a number of initiatives have focused on promoting the development of palliative care programs and practitioners in U.S. hospitals. In 2001, we published the first report of the prevalence of hospital-based palliative care programs in the United States. 5 In this study, we update this report by examining the growth of hospital based palliative care programs from 2000-2003 and expand upon it by identifying hospital characteristics that predict both the presence and development of a palliative care program.

The AHA surveys all hospitals, both AHA member and nonmember hospitals, in the United States and its associated areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) on an annual basis. Data included in the survey are: organizational structure and source of control of the hospitals (not-for-profit, church-operated, for-profit, government-federal, and government-nonfederal); clinical facilities or services offered by the hospitals (e.g., general medical-surgical care, pediatrics care, various types of intensive care units, physical rehabilitation, psychiatric services, cardiac programs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] care, etc.); beds and utilization, Medicare/Medicaid utilization; revenues; expenses; uncompensated care; and professional staffing levels (e.g., physicians, dentists, residents, nurses). For the facilities and services, the survey also requests information on the manner in which a service is provided (e.g., hospitalowned, provided by the hospital's health system or network, and/or provided through a formal contract between the hospital and another provider). Survey response rates over the past 5 years have averaged 86%.\nIn 2001, the AHA Annual Survey began surveying hospitals as to the presence of a palliative care program. In the questionnaire, a palliative care program is defined as, \"an organized program providing specialized medical care, drugs or therapies for the management of acute or chronic pain and/or the control of symptoms administered by specially trained physicians and other clinicians; and supportive care services, such as counseling on advanced directives, spiritual care, and social services, to patients with advanced disease and their families.\" Hospitals are also surveyed as to whether they operate a community hospice program.\nFor the years 2000-2003, we identified all programs that self-reported the presence of a hospital-owned palliative care program. Adult hospitals included general medical-surgical hospitals, specialized cancer hospitals, and specialized cardiac hospitals. We excluded rehabilitation hospi-tals, psychiatric hospitals, hospitals that only provided obstetric services, subacute and chronic care facilities, and eye, ear, nose, and throat hospitals. For pediatric programs, we included hospitals that limited admission to children and provided acute medical and surgical services. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify hospital characteristics significantly associated with the presence of an adult palliative care program in the 2003 survey data. Covariates entered into the model were those that reached borderline significance (p \u03fd 0.15) in univariate and bivariate analyses or had construct validity.

Greater numbers of hospital beds (Table 2) and critical care beds (odds ratio \u03ed 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.03; p \u03ed \u03fd0.001) increased the likelihood of having a palliative care program as did being a member of the American Association of Medical Colleges Council of Teaching Hospitals (odds ratio \u03ed 1.95; 95% CI, 1.35-2.81; p \u03fd 0.001), and an American College of Surgery (ACS)-approved cancer hospital (odds ratio \u03ed 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19-1.85; p \u03fd 0.001). Compared to not-for profit hospitals, VA hospitals were significantly more likely to have a palliative care program (odds ratio \u03ed 8.01; 95% CI, 4.36-14.74; p \u03fd 0.001) and city, county, or state and for-profit hospitals were significantly less likely to have a palliative care program (odds ratio \u03ed 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.88; p \u03fd 0.003 and odds ratio \u03ed 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31-0.63; p \u03ed \u03fd0.001, respectively). Finally, hospitals that reported being operated by the Catholic Church were significantly more likely to have a palliative care program than non-Catholic Church-operated hospitals and hospitals that owned their own hospice program were more also likely to report a palliative care program.

Hospital palliative care programs have been associated in preliminary studies with demonstrable improvements in both care quality and health care costs. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis [32][33][34][35] of hospital palliative care programs demonstrated improvement in pain, nonpain symptoms, patient and family satisfaction, as well as reduced hospital length of stay and inhospital death rates. Others 36 have reported a high rate of implementation of interventions recommended by palliative care consultants, including symptom management, goal setting, advance care planning, and discharge planning. Finally, several single-center studies of palliative care 37,38 and multicenter studies of ethics consultation 39,40 have suggested substantial reductions in direct and indirect costs associated with hos-pital palliative care compared to conventional care, an observation that has thus far been consistent across a range of hospital settings, patient populations, and clinical service delivery models.\nOur data suggest that although growth in palliative care programs has occurred throughout the nation's hospitals, larger hospitals, academic medical centers, not-for-profit hospitals, and VA hospitals were significantly more likely to develop a program compared to other hospitals. Possible reasons for the patterns of growth that we observed include VA policy that mandates palliative care programs 28 ; the growth in palliative care research and fellowship training programs within academic medical centers 9,29 ; philanthropic foundation investment in large academic programs 27 ; and the disproportionate impact of the increases in numbers and costs of chronically ill Medicare patients on larger hospitals. 26,30,31 Despite these preliminary data suggesting improvements both in health care quality and in costs as a result of hospital palliative care interventions, research is needed 41 to assure that these MORRISON ET AL. 1132 new palliative care programs are supported in the delivery of evidence-based quality and efficient care, and to confirm and explore the early reports of their benefits. Specifically, studies are necessary to define replicable and standardized interventions for the core components of palliative care (symptom management, doctor-patient communication, and coordination of care across settings); to determine what components of palliative care team interventions are associated with improved outcomes (and which are not); as well as to determine which clinical models are optimal for specific care settings (hospital, long term care, home, capitation versus fee for service) and patient populations. 11,20 Additional strategies are required to stimulate growth in smaller community based hospitals, perhaps with alternate program structures.

We examined family caregiver reports of physician communication about incurable illness, life expectancy, and hospice; the timing of these discussions; and subsequent family understanding of these issues. Design: Mixed methods study using a closed-ended survey of 206 family caregivers and open-ended, in-depth interviews with 12 additional family caregivers.Measurements: Family caregiver reports provided at the time of hospice enrollment of physician discussions of incurable illness, life expectancy, and hospice. Results: Many family caregivers reported that a physician never told them the patient's illness could not be cured (20.8%), never provided life expectancy (40% of those reportedly told illness was incurable), and never discussed using hospice (32.2%). Caregivers reported the first discussion of the illness being incurable and of hospice as a possibility occurred within 1 month of the patient's death in many cases (23.5% and 41.1%, respectively). In open-ended interviews, however, family caregivers expressed ambivalence about what they wanted to know, and their difficulty comprehending and accepting \"bad news\" was apparent in both qualitative and quantitative data.Our findings suggest that ineffective communication about end-of-life issues likely results from both physician's lack of discussion and family caregiver's difficulty hearing the news. Future studies should examine strategies for optimal physician-family caregiver communication about incurable illness, so that families and patients can begin the physical, emotional, and spiritual work that can lead to acceptance of the irreversible condition.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION C", "text": "OMMUNICATION IS A KEY ELEMENT of high-quality care in end-of-life care. [1][2][3][4][5] Several studies have examined what matters to patients and families at the end of life, and having a clear understanding of the patient's illness and treatment options are frequently mentioned as being important. [6][7][8] Despite widespread acceptance that communication among patients, families, and clinicians is an important component of high quality care, empirical data suggest that communication about end-of-life care is often limited in frequency and scope. 1,[9][10][11][12][13] The scope and timing of communication about end-of-life issues between primary family caregivers and the patient's clinicians are particularly important. Family members often play central roles in end-of-life treatment decisions, [14][15][16][17][18] and they depend on clinicians for an understanding of prognosis and alternative approaches to care including hospice. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how and when key elements of communication between family caregivers and physicians take place in the months prior to death. Three recent studies on this topic 9,16,17 reveal substantial limitations in family caregiver and physician communication at the end of life including infrequent discussion of hospice by physicians, 16 inadequacy in physician understanding of patient preferences and shared decision making, 17 and poor agreement on whether prognosis information was discussed among patient, family members, and physicians. 9 Although these studies are valuable, the first 16 focuses only on hospice discussions rather than other areas of communication that may be important and does not examine the timing of such discussions relative to hospice enrollment or death; the second 17 focuses on patient experiences, rather than family caregiver experiences, and the third 9 examines family caregivers of seriously ill patients who were not yet in the final phases of life, so the findings may underestimate the frequency and scope of discussions that take place closer to the time of death.\nTo understand physician-family caregiver communication at the end of life better, we sought to describe patterns of communication regarding three key elements: (1) communication that the patient's illness could not be cured, (2) communication of life expectancy, and (3) communication about the possibility of using hospice.\nWe focused on primary family caregivers of adult patients with cancer who received hospice prior to their death. We studied patients with cancer because the increased prognostication accuracy for this illness 19,20 makes effective communication about incurable illness, life expectancy, and hospice more feasible.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design and sample", "text": "We used mixed methods 21 to examine communication between physicians and primary family caregivers about incurable illness, life expectancy, and hospice.

The present study was part of a larger prospective, longitudinal study 23 examining caregiver wellness using data from interviews with primary family caregivers at the time of the patient's enrollment with hospice and again at 6 and 13 months after the patient's death.\nThe quantitative portion of the present mixedmethods study used data from structured interviews with 206 primary family caregivers of patients with incurable cancer consecutively enrolled in the largest hospice facility in the state of Connecticut between October 1999 and September 2001. Primary family caregivers were identified by the primary hospice nurse as the person most involved with the patient's health care. We attempted to conduct these interviews at the time of hospice enrollment before the patient's death; however, that was not possible for all caregivers, and 130 of the 206 caregivers were interviewed in the month after the death. A total of 391 caregivers were initially approached during the enrollment period by a hospice staff research liaison. Out of the 391 approached, 100 caregivers requested not to be contacted for the study, 28 could not be contacted because of missing or inaccurate telephone or address information, 6 of the caregivers were either too ill or cognitively impaired to participate as determined by the interviewer, and 51 of the caregivers were con-", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMUNICATION ABOUT CARE AT THE END OF LIFE 1177", "text": "tacted but refused to participate.

We used purposive sampling as is common in qualitative research 24,25 yielding a sample that reflected diverse demographic characteristics of the caregivers (e.g., gender, age, marital status and relationship to the patient).We continued interviewing until we reached theoretical saturation on the primary topic of interest: communication preceding hospice enrollment.

I just don't know if the doctors knew, but they must have. Why wouldn't they tell us? You have got to wonder why they put her through all that-I mean the chemo and especially the radiology and all those burns. She was in pain and had burns everywhere from the radiation. It was awful. She wouldn't have gone through it if she had known what they knew, but they told us it was curable; so what are you going to do? I don't think the decisions were in our control at all. We were not the empowered ones in this because we did not know. How can you know? I mean, we are not the experts in medical things. Should we be? We didn't really have any decisions to make because we didn't know anything. And they told us that her disease was curable. They even said the cancer was gone. That still has me wondering even now. What did they know?\nIn contrast, one caregiver expressed not wanting to know more about the patient's illness and life expectancy, as illustrated by this quotation:\nNo, to tell you the truth, I'm very happy that the doctor never made mention of her prognosis. I'm sure the doctor knew because when she [patient] said \"How much time have I got,\" he said, \"Well, what do you think?\" He left it up to her. He didn't say X amount of time because I think, probably, it would have made her more distraught, and maybe worry more.\nFinally, some caregivers were ambivalent about how the communication should have taken place and whether they wanted to know more or not. As stated by one caregiver: I think maybe the doctor needs to be hopeful, but also plant a seed that [she could be dying]. For instance, he could say, \"We have another drug we can try. I don't know if it CHERLIN ET AL. 1182 FIG. 4. Physician-family caregiver communication and caregiver understanding about hospice (n \u03ed 124). will work or not.\" But that is not what he did. He didn't say, \"I don't know if it will work.\" Instead, he said, \"I haven't given up hope on you yet.\" Maybe, there is another way to say it. I don't know.

We find that in a notable minority of cases primary family caregivers report that they have not been told by a physician that the patient's illness cannot be cured, and even larger proportions never discuss hospice with the patients' physicians. Although this finding is consistent with previous research, 1,16,29,30 we additionally find that those who are told that the patient's illness is not curable are often told very late in the course of the patient's illness. In a number of cases, communication about the illness being incurable and the possibility of hospice as an alternative is reported to occur only in the last month or even week of the patient's life. The reported apparent delay in such discussions may be preventable, especially in the case of cancer for which prognostication is more accurate. 12,19,31 Reducing delays in communication regarding the patient's illness may provide more opportunities for patients and families to say goodbye, complete personal and financial arrangements, and plan for the last phase of the patient's life. Data suggest that patients and families value being able to prepare for death [5][6][7]32 and timely, effective communication about the irreversible and progressive illness can promote such preparation.\nIn addition, we find that the family caregivers' own understanding of the patient's condition and the possible treatment alternatives is strongly influenced by discussions they report having with the physician. In the vast majority of cases, family caregivers report that they did not know the patient's illness was incurable or that hospice might be appropriate until a physician raised it with them, and patients whose family caregiver reported discussions of the patient's incurable illness had significantly longer hospice length of stays prior to death. The importance of physi-cian-family caregiver discussions of the patient's terminal status was shown a decade ago to be associated with hospice use 13 ; the current study suggests that such discussions may also be important to earlier hospice enrollment in the course of the illness. Recent research has shown significant benefits of earlier hospice enrollment for both patients and family caregivers, 23,33 and earlier communication about hospice as an option might promote its more timely consideration and use.\nOur findings concerning the discussion and understanding of life expectancy paint a somewhat more complex picture. While only a minority of family caregivers did not believe the patient's illness was incurable after a physician told them, a larger proportion of caregivers did not accept the prognosticated life expectancy provided by the physician. In fact, only a quarter of family caregivers reported that they agreed with the physician when he/she provided an estimated life expectancy. Many were either more optimistic or more pessimistic than the physician, but more importantly, nearly 40% still indicated that they did not know and would not estimate the patient's life expectancy, even after a physician reportedly provided such information. Prior work has indicated that prognosis is often not discussed 9,10,12 or discussed only indirectly. 10,11,31 Our finding is consistent with this previous literature but also suggests that, even when physicians discuss prognosis, family caregivers may not agree or accept to what has been said. Therefore, family caregivers' limited understanding of prognosis likely results from a combination of physician and caregiver communication factors, not from poor physician communication alone. Future research is needed to understand why family caregivers may not accept the prognostic information provided to them by physicians, such as lack of trust in the physician, lack of demonstrated reliability of these predictions, denial, a sense that time of death is divinely determined, or some combination of these.\nThe complexity of communicating effectively and appropriately about end-of-life issues is highlighted by the voices of several caregivers who reflect the ambivalence they felt about knowing the truth and the related ambiguity likely felt by physicians in deciding how and when to communicate such sensitive and potentially unreliable information. Although most caregivers reported wanting to know about the", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMUNICATION ABOUT CARE AT THE END OF LIFE 1183", "text": "patient's condition and alternatives earlier in the course of the patient's illness, several did not want to know more, and others remained conflicted about what they wanted to know and when. Faced with this variation in family caregiver desires and needs for communication, the challenge may be not in teaching physicians to communicate more with patients and families, but in assessing which patients and families desire and would benefit from such communication.\nDespite the principles of autonomy and informed decision-making, uniform approaches to communication in this area are unlikely to be successful or appropriate, given the diversity of preferences and views of patients and their families. Our findings should be interpreted in light of our study limitations. Caregiver reports of physician communication and its timing are subjective and may be biased. Previous studies have found that caregiver and physician reports about communication at the end of life differ, and agreement on communication is limited. 9 Furthermore, we did not examine communication between the patient and physician. Nevertheless, given that the primary family caregiver is often a strong influence on treatment choices, 13,14,34 the caregiver's perception of what is communicated remains an important factor that may influence end-of-life outcomes. In addition, our sample focuses on caregivers of hospice users, who may report greater communication than caregivers of patients do not receive hospice; therefore, our findings may underestimate the deficiencies in end-of-life communication in a more general population of dying patients and their families. We interviewed caregivers at one point in time, potentially limiting our ability to measure changes in their perceptions over time. Reported communication did not differ significantly between caregivers interviewed before and caregivers interviewed after the patient's death. Our response rate was similar to studies of this nature and our nonresponding caregivers did not differ in gender or kinship with the patient; however, they may have differed in unmeasured ways from the participants. The direction of this potential bias cannot be predicted. Finally, our study was conducted in a single state with a relatively modest sample of caregivers; however, our objectives were descriptive in nature, and this exploratory study provides new insights about the timing, scope, and acceptance of physician communication with family caregivers about care at the end of life. Future efforts should include more geographically, culturally, and racially/ethnically diverse groups to further understand the complexity of communication about end-of-life issues.\nAlthough communication is a critical element of high quality end-of-life care, 1-5 many family caregivers report limited and delayed communication about the incurable illness, life expectancy, and hospice as a treatment alternative. Our findings suggest that approaches to communication, which is central to the care itself, will be most effective if tailored to fit the circumstances and preferences of patients and families. Physicians' discussions of these topics do influence family caregivers, who often become aware of the gravity of the patient's situation for the first time during discussion with a physician, but who also may require time to accept the implications of the new information. Disparities between what physicians think they are communicating and what caregivers hear communicated are important to understand in light of our findings. Future studies should examine strategies for optimal physician-family caregiver communication about incurable and progressive illness, so that families and patients can begin the physical, emotional, and spiritual work that can lead to acceptance of the irreversible condition.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "What is wrong with endof life care-Opinions of bereaved family members", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "1997", "authors": "L Hanson; M Danis; J Garret"}, {"title": "Institute of Medicine: Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life", "journal": "National Academy Press", "year": "1997", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Measuring quality of care at the end of life-A statement of principles", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "1997", "authors": "J Lynn"}, {"title": "Quality-oflife trajectories", "journal": "Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics", "year": "2000", "authors": "E H Bradley; T F Fried; S V Kasl; E L Idler"}, {"title": "Quality end-of-life care: Patients' perspectives", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1999", "authors": "P A Singer; D K Martin; M Kelner"}, {"title": "Preparing for the end of life: Preferences of patients, families, physicians and other care providers", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2001", "authors": "K E Steinhauser; N Christakis; E C Clipp; M Mcneilly; S Grambow; J Parker; J A Tulsky"}, {"title": "Factors considered important at the end of life by patients, family, physicians, and other care providers", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2000", "authors": "K E Steinhauser; N A Christakis; E C Clipp; M Mcneilly; L Mcintyre; J A Tulsky"}, {"title": "Family caregiver knowledge of treatment intent in a longitudinal study of patients with advanced cancer", "journal": "Support Care Cancer", "year": "2003", "authors": "C M Burns; T Dixon; D Broom; W T Smith; P S Craft"}, {"title": "Prognosis communication in serious illness: Perceptions of older patients, caregivers, and clinicians", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "2003", "authors": "T R Fried; E H Bradley; O Leary; J "}, {"title": "Death Foretold: Prophecy and Prognosis in Medical Care", "journal": "The University of Chicago Press", "year": "1999", "authors": "N A Christakis"}, {"title": "Truth may hurt but deceit hurts more: communication in palliative care", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "2002", "authors": "L J Fallowfield; V A Jenkins; H A Beveridge"}, {"title": "Documentation of discussions about prognosis with terminally ill patients", "journal": "Am J Med", "year": "2001", "authors": "E H Bradley; A G Hallemeier; T R Fried; R Johnson-Hurzeler; E J Cherlin; S V Kasl; S M Horwitz"}, {"title": "Socialization to dying: social determinants of death acknowledgement and treatment among terminally ill geriatric patients", "journal": "J Health Soc Behav", "year": "1992", "authors": "H G Prigerson"}, {"title": "Old and alone: Surrogate health care decision-making for the elderly without families", "journal": "J Aging Stud", "year": "1990", "authors": "D M High"}, {"title": "Care of the family when the patient is dying", "journal": "West J Med", "year": "1995", "authors": "P B Bascom; S W Tolle"}, {"title": "How should clinicians describe hospice to patients and families?", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "2004", "authors": "D J Casarett; R L Crowley; K B Hirschman"}, {"title": "Family perspectives on end-of-life care at the last place of care", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2004", "authors": "J M Teno; B R Clarridge; V Casey; L C Welch; T Wetle; R Shield; V Mor"}, {"title": "The promise of a good death", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "1998", "authors": "E Emanuel; L Emanuel"}, {"title": "Defining the \"Terminally Ill\": Insights from SUPPORT", "journal": "Duquesne Law Rev", "year": "1996", "authors": "J Lynn; F E Harrell; F Cohn; M B Hamel; N Dawson; A W Wu"}, {"title": "Accurate prognostications of death.

Nursing homes are an increasingly common site for terminal care. Nearly half of United States citizens who reach the age of 65 will spend some time in a nursing home. 1 In 1997, 1 in 4 adult deaths took place in a nurs-ing home, and terminal care in nursing homes is likely to increase as the population ages. [2][3][4] The mortality rate among nursing home residents is approximately 25% per year, and most long-stay residents remain in the nursing home to die rather than transferring to the hospital. 2,5 Nursing home residents do not consistently receive high-quality palliative care. Staff training and incentive systems emphasize restorative care rather than symptom control and quality of life. 6,7 Surviving family members report greater dissatisfaction with nursing homes than with any other component of terminal care. 8 Residents increasingly forego life-sustaining treatment and hospitalization, but these decisions are not linked to effective plans for palliative care. 9,10 Usual nursing home care results in high rates of untreated severe pain, [11][12][13][14] unmet needs for emotional and spiritual care, 15 and little or no support for bereaved family members. 16 Residents diagnosed with advanced dementia receive treatments that may prolong life but also increase discomfort. 17 Nursing staff in long-term care perceive the need to improve end of life care, including enhanced staffing and improved training. 18 The limitations of usual nursing home care may increase the impact of hospice services. Baer and Hanson 19 surveyed recently bereaved family about the added value of hospice in nursing homes. Hospice increased favorable ratings of symptom management from 64% to 90%. Family respondents identified unique hospice services, and 53% believed it reduced the need for hospitalization. 19 In a case-control study of nursing home residents who died with or without Hospice, Miller et al. 20,21 found that Hospice resulted in improved pain management and reduced use of tube feeding, intravenous fluids and physical restraints during the dying experience.\nAlthough hospice improves the quality of endof-life care in nursing homes, decedents in this setting are less likely to access hospice services than people who die at home. Hospices vary in their delivery of services to nursing home residents. In 2000, North Carolina's 87 hospice agencies served 2261 nursing home residents. Over half of these residents were served by 7 agencies, while 28 agencies did not serve any residents (Carolinas Center for Hospice and End of Life Care, unpublished data). Use of hospice varies geographically, from a national average of 5.6% to over 20% of nursing home decedents in Florida. 22,23 Nursing home organizational characteristics are associated with access to hospice. 22,23 Variations in use suggest that provider norms, not patient preferences, determine access to nursing home hospice.\nNursing home residents have access to hospice only when the nursing home and hospice administrators have a contractual agreement. Only one prior study has examined the role of nursing home administrators in facilitating or preventing access to hospice. This study found that administrators' attitudes correlated with use of hospice. 24 The study was limited to a small nursing home sample, did not include hospice perspectives, and used a very brief survey. Our prior research suggests that long-term care staff do not always perceive hospice as important to improve the quality of end-of-life care. 18 Experience and expert opinion indicate that Medicare reimbursement rules, contractual constraints, and concerns over fraud may act as barriers to use of nursing home hospice. 7,25 To examine the potential effect of administrators' attitudes on nursing home hospice use, we surveyed all nursing home and hospice administrators in the state of North Carolina. The study's specific aims were to compare nursing home and hospice administrators' attitudes about facilitators and barriers to nursing home hospice and to test whether nursing home administrators' attitudes are associated with greater or lesser actual use of nursing home hospice.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "We mailed a structured survey to administrators in all 387 nursing homes and 87 hospices in North Carolina. Survey items included respondent demographic data, nursing home organizational characteristics, hospice use, and attitudinal items about nursing home hospice. To measure hospice use, respondents provided information on presence or absence of a current nursing home hospice contract, current number of nursing home hospice enrollees, and number of enrollees during the past 3 months. To measure attitudes toward hospice use, investigators developed survey items based on literature review and interviews with experts and clinicians familiar with nursing home and hospice care. Surveys included parallel items for both types of administrators, with responses on a four-point Likert scale of \"strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree.\" Item domains included effects of hospice on quality of care, and contractual or financial factors that might facilitate or limit the use of nursing home hospice. A draft survey instrument was piloted with 2 hospice and 2 nursing home administrators for clarity, relevance and face validity of items. Investigators made revisions based on their comments, and the final version of the survey was mailed to potential respondents.\nNonrespondents to the initial mailing received a second mailing of the survey. Nonrespondents to the second mailing received a third mailing with a brightly colored survey form. As an incentive, all respondents were offered $10 for a completed survey.\nSurvey data was entered in a secure database, and converted to a SAS database for analyses. Investigators first compared nursing home and hospice administrator responses to all parallel attitudinal items to examine differences between the two groups. To meet the second goal, investigators compared responses for two groups of nursing home administrators; those with less than or greater than the median number of hospice enrollees in the preceding 3 months. To ensure that hospice enrollment was possible, only responses from administrators with a current hospice contract were included in this analysis. Comparisons of proportions were done using chi-square testing, and comparison of continuous variables using t tests. Initial analyses used data from the 4point Likert scaled responses.

Among nursing home administrators, more positive attitudes were associated with greater use of hospice by residents in their facilities. Nursing home administrators may influence access to hospice services for residents within their facilities.\nOur findings may be interpreted to mean that nursing home administrators who believe hospice improves the quality of end-of-life care may facilitate access to hospice services. Alternatively, greater experience with hospice may lead administrators to develop more positive percep-tions of its value. We found an association between attitudes and practice for items related to quality of care, but no association for items measuring regulatory or financial barriers. Although a majority of nursing home administrators believe that Medicare rules hinder cooperation and create a financial disincentive, these beliefs were not associated with actual use of the service once a contract was established.\nThe results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. The cross-sectional design means that associations are not directional, and cannot state cause and effect relationships. Administrators' attitudes may influence hospice referral patterns, or simply be the result of greater or lesser exposure to hospice care. The study is limited to the experience of administrators in one state, and may not generalize to other geographic regions. Although response rates are good, nonresponse bias may affect results. Investigators could not obtain data on nonrespondents to ascertain differences. However, this sample is more generalizable than any other published study on this topic, and North Carolina end of life practices are similar to national averages. 4 Finally, it is important to acknowledge that administrators' attitudes are likely to explain only a portion of the variance in hospice use among nursing homes. Other factors such as local patient characteristics, physician practices, and willingness of hospices to serve patients with dementia are also likely to influence access. 26  on patient requests for types of treatment, and difficulty in prognosis related to diagnoses such as dementia. 27,28 The results of this study have implications for clinical practice, for policy, and for future research. Dying nursing home residents who wish to access hospice services must overcome barriers unique to this setting. Physicians and family caregivers may need to convince reluctant administrators, or select nursing homes based on hospice access. Given that a majority of nursing home and hospice administrators agree that Medicare rules are a major barrier, reforming these rules may be an important strategy to facilitate collaborative care. Future research should test new models of hospice services tailored to the needs and conditions of the nursing home environment.

Prognostic information facilitates more realistic decision making regarding ongoing treatment, fosters risk-benefit considerations of specific interventions, and contributes to appropriate utilization of health care services. Objective: The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) has been used as a tool for measurement of functional status in palliative care. This study explores the application of the PPS as a tool for projecting length of stay until death or discharge in a home-based hospice program. Methods: Records of 396 patients admitted to a large community-based hospice program between January 1, 2001, and March 31, 2001, were reviewed. PPS scores were evaluated for their predictive ability related to length of hospice survival and consideration for hospice discharge. Other variables analyzed included diagnosis, presence of comorbidities, and age. Results: PPS scores were associated with length of survival. Negative-change scores were predictive of patient decline toward death, while stable PPS ratings over time resulted in discharge consideration. The tool as used by this hospice was not highly discriminating between the 30% to 40% scores or the 50% to 70% scores.The PPS scores are associated with patient length of survival in a hospice program and can be used in evaluating hospice appropriateness. BACKGROUND", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "P ROGNOSTICATION PLAYS an important role in end-of-life care. 1 Predictions about prognosis can aid in autonomous decision making by patients and families, allow for appropriate future planning, and facilitate appropriate use of resources at the end of life by avoidance of futile care. 2 While nine out of ten persons polled wish to die at home, one in five will die in the hospital, often after receiving the most technologically advanced care, a discrepancy that may arise from the inability to effectively prognosticate. 3 When patients were asked to rate important attributes of end-of-life care, 96% rated knowing what to expect about their physical condition as very important. 4 Effective prognostication can also be useful in research by ensuring both that patients with similar illness severity are compared and that findings predictive of long-term outcomes are correctly interpreted in randomized, controlled clinical trials. 5 When therapeutic options are still feasible, prognosis is not nearly as important as it becomes when treatment options and diagnostic knowledge are limited. 6 Yet physicians and other health care professionals are poorly trained in prognostication and feel ill-prepared to make such predictions. 5 The Hospice Medicare Benefit requires the patient's attending physician and the hospice medical director to certify that the patient admitted has a prognosis of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal course; therefore, hospice programs have a definite need for an objective measure of prognosis in terms of length of survival. Physician establishment of prognosis is a key factor in timely hospice referral and facilitation of maximal benefit from hospice care. 7 The hospice program is held accountable for continued evaluation of the patient's prognosis and discharge of the patient if the prognosis deviates from the 6month life expectancy.\nPrevious studies have found great variability in the ability to predict the hospice length of stay. Forster and Lynn asked two oncologists, an internist, an oncology nurse and a hospice social worker to predict the life expectancy of 108 inpatient hospice candidates. Predictions were found to be overly optimistic by an average of 3.4 weeks, the predictions were only moderately correlated with actual life-span, and no two prognosticator's predictions correlated closely with one another. 8 Christakis and Escarce analyzed the survival of 6451 hospice patients and found short survival overall (36 days), substantial variation in length of survival after enrollment, and substantial variation based on diagnosis. 9 Another study by Christakis and Lamont asked 343 different doctors to make survival estimates for 468 terminally ill patients at the time of hospice referral. Only 20% of their predictions were accurate. Sixty-three percent were overoptimistic, while 17% were overpessimistic. 10 While optimism may have value in patient care, optimistic bias in predicting length of life may often deprive patients of timely access to the full range of hospice services 7 and to personal closure, such as saying good-bye to loved ones.\nA number of studies have evaluated the use of the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) as a predictor of length of survival. Developed in 1948 to evaluate patient response in cancer treatment, the Karnofsky Scale evaluates functional status with a focus on the need for hospitalization. 11 Studies conflict regarding the tool's ability to predict sur-vival, with some studies showing strong correlations and others weaker relationships with survival. 8,12,13 Numerous researchers have found that symptom factors are important adjuncts to the KPS in predicting length of survival. [14][15][16][17] Influential symptoms include weight loss, dyspnea, dry mouth, and disorientation. 7 Bruera and colleagues found dysphagia, cognitive failure, and weight loss to be strongly associated with survival after hospice referral. 17 In a review of the literature on estimating length of survival in endstage cancer, den Daas found that performance status was the strongest variable associated with length of stay and that some aspect of problematic nutrition was the second strongest. Several studies also found that mental status deterioration was associated with a shorter length of stay. 18 In 1996, the PPS, a tool developed by the Victoria Hospice Society, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, was introduced. 11 Designed to measure functional performance and progressive decline in palliative care patients, this tool was not oriented to evaluation for hospitalization like the Karnofsky Scale. Used in Victoria for the communication of patient status and the evaluation of home nursing care workloads, the PPS was also recommended for studying the effects of treatment on the patient, planning visits according to patient acuity, and making discharge decisions. Noted advantages of the tool are simplicity (written instructions and definitions accompanying the tool circumvent the need for any additional training) and speed (the tool can be completed within minutes).\nThe strength of the PPS as a prognostic guide is that it evaluates the patient's performance status (ambulation, activity, extent of the disease, and self-care) similar to the KPS, but also adds evaluation of intake and level of consciousness. The PPS should be an improvement over the KPS as a predictor of hospice length of stay as it includes three additional highly predictive variables of survival: performance status, nutritional limitations, and mental status deterioration.\nVirik and Glare found the PPS to be valid and reliable in that the score on admission predicted outcome and time to death on discharge and the prediction appeared to be irrespective of other clinical or demographic variables. 19 Morita et al. found the PPS to be highly correlated with the KPS. 20 ", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PROGNOSTICATION IN HOSPICE CARE 493", "text": "A limiting factor in using either the KPS or the PPS is that both are primarily based on the patient's functional status.

Although the involved hospice had utilized the tool to evaluate and document admission, ongoing appropriateness, and discharge consideration for over 5 years, no study had been done to verify its appropriateness for such use.

A followup study at this hospice after in-servicing all the nurses on the instructions for use and definition of terms distributed with the scale might reveal better discrimination between categories.\nMorita et al., 20 Virik and Glare, 19 and our study found distinct survival profiles based on the PPS scores. Unlike the Morita study, we did not have sufficient numbers of patients to substantiate individual categories for the 10% and \u054670% admission PPS categories. Notwithstanding, we found similarly distinct survival profiles, supportive of the assertion of the utility of admission PPS scores in predicting patient survival. Our results related to analysis by diagnosis groups are consistent with other studies evaluating noncancer diagnoses. We found noncancer diagnoses HEAD ET AL. 498 to be less predictable and that patients with lung disease and dementia have longer hospice stays on the average than patients with cancer. 7,9,23 While patients with dementia or debility had the lowest average PPS scores on admission and were the oldest of any patient group, 33.3% of them were discharged. The extreme differences between the mean and median lengths of survival for patients with lung disease and dementia may be reflective of the trajectory of these illnesses, with acute exacerbations and periods of stability, versus the gradual decline of the majority of patients with cancer. Patients discharged did not differ from patients who died based on the PPS at admission: the mean score for all patients was 38.9%, while the mean for discharged patients was 41.2%, and both groups had median scores of 40%. However, the scores of patients discharged did not decline significantly, as did the scores of patients who died. Stable PPS scores over time may well justify discharge, especially if the patient's length of stay approaches the outer limits of the 6-month Medicare benefit. Thus, it appears that stability in functional status over time may be predictive of an improved prognosis. Data related to survival patterns after being discharged alive were not available and, therefore, it was not possible to further assess the appropriateness of discharge decisions based on improved prognosis.\nCertain characteristics of the study population limit analysis in this study. Heavy concentration of PPS scores in the 30% to 40% range, with very few cases having scores at either end of the scale, restricts comparative analysis. While we can determine the length of survival for patients in the range of from 30% to 40%, low numbers in the 10% to 20% and 70% and above ranges limit what we can predict for patients in these ranges. The overall short length of stay for hospice patients in the study hospice, a problem common to most hospice programs, means that the majority of the patients have low scores based on physical function.\nThe data set used for this study required PPS scoring by the same clinician who acted on the score (i.e., the nurse assigning the PPS score helped decide when and if the patient would be discharged). This is a limiting factor in evaluating the relationship of PPS scores to discharge decisions, as is the low number of patients discharged in this study population.\nAnother limiting factor was the low numbers of patients admitted with noncancer diagnoses. Our data support differences in functional performance and length of survival among the major hospice diagnoses groups, but results may be more generalizable if a greater number of noncancer patients had been included. However, we chose to define our population by admission date rather than diagnosis group.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study, the PPS proved to be significantly associated with hospice length of survival.

However, the tools available to guide prognostication and care planning in this population have limited data to support their use. For instance, one of the most widely-used prognostic tools, the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), has been studied primarily in inpatient settings and in patients with cancer. Its prognostic value in a heterogeneous US hospice population is unknown. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the PPS as a predictor of mortality in a heterogeneous hospice population, and to determine whether it performs equally well across diagnoses and sites of care. Design: Prospective cohort study using existing medical records. Setting/Subjects: This study was conducted at a large community hospice program, and included all patients enrolled in hospice during the study period. Measurements: Each patient's PPS score was recorded at the time of enrollment and patients were followed until death or discharge from hospice. Results: A total of 466 patients enrolled in hospice during the study period. The PPS score was a strong independent predictor of mortality (log rank test of Kaplan Meier survival curves p \u03fd 0.001). Six-month mortality rates for 3 PPS categories were 96% (for PPS scores 10-20), 89% (for PPS scores 30-40), and 81% (for PPS scores \u054650). Evaluation of interaction terms in Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated a stronger association between PPS score and mortality among nursing home residents and patients with non-cancer diagnoses. Analysis of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated strong predictive value overall, with somewhat greater accuracy for nursing home residents and patients with noncancer diagnoses.The PPS performs well as a predictor of prognosis in a heterogeneous hospice population, and performs particularly well for nursing home residents and for patients with non-cancer diagnoses. The PPS should be useful in confirming hospice eligibility for reimbursement purposes and in guiding plans for hospice care.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A LTHOUGH MOST PATIENTS who enroll in hospice die very soon, their survival is also highly variable. For instance, the national median length of hospice service is approximately 21 days, and one-third of patients enroll in the last week of life. 1 However, some patients survive for several months after enrollment and a few (approximately 5%) live for more than 6 months. 1 This variability makes it very challenging for referring physicians to predict prognosis accurately. 2 In addition, it is often very difficult for hospice providers to develop care plans that accurately anticipate their patients' trajectories of decline and death.\nSeveral simple rating scales have been developed to allow clinicians to predict prognosis using readily available clinical data. Some of these, like the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) have been developed and validated primarily cancer patients. [3][4][5] Others, such as the Karnofsky Performance Scale, have been used in other populations, but have scale categories that make them less suitable for a hospice population (e.g. \"need for hospitalization\"). 6 The most promising prognostic scale for use with hospice patients is the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS). 7 A modification of the Karnofsky, the PPS has been found to have good construct validity and interrater reliability and appears to be a good predictor of mortality for patients in palliative care units. 8,9 Anecdotal data suggest that the PPS is becoming a widely used screening tool for hospice admission for many large hospice organizations. However, published reports of the PPS's prognostic accuracy come from palliative care inpatient populations, and these data are drawn mostly from cancer patients. [7][8][9] The PPS has not been adequately evaluated as a predictor of prognosis in home-dwelling patients, nursing home residents, and patients with noncancer diagnoses. It is particularly important to evaluate the PPS's predictive value in these hospice patients because approximately 80% of hospice care in the United States is delivered in these settings and at least half of U.S. hospice patients are admitted with non-cancer diagnoses. 1 There are at least two ways in which the PPS could improve the care of hospice patients, if it is found to have acceptable predictive ability. First, more accurate prognostic estimates would help hospice staff to develop care plans that anticipate imminent death, ensuring that resources are mobilized quickly for these patients. Second, more accurate prognostic estimates could help hospices to justify the appropriateness of admissions to fiscal intermediaries that review the appropriateness of hospice admissions.\nTherefore, the goals of this study were to examine the prognostic accuracy of PPS in a U.S. hospice population and to determine whether its accuracy is affected by diagnosis or site of care.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Sample and recruitment", "text": "This study was conducted at the Hospice of Lancaster County (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) over a 12-month period spanning 2003-2004.

A score of 0, corresponding to death, anchors the lower end of the scale. Raters evaluate domains in the order described above, and so the first domains contribute most to the composite score.

Next, we plotted survival data to determine that the proportional hazards assumption was valid. 11,12 Next, to examine the PPS's performance in the subgroups of interest (e.g., groups defined by site of care and diagnosis), we evaluated the significance of interaction terms (PPS \u03eb diagnosis; PPS \u03eb site of care) in Cox proportional hazard models. When interaction terms were significant, we then compared the PPS's predictive value in each subgroup (e.g., cancer vs. noncancer) by calculating its ability to predict death at 1, 3, 7, 30, and 90 days after enrollment.

The mean PPS of the sample was 38 (standard deviation \u03ed 13.5; range 10-70). Because there were so few patients with PPS scores of 60 or 70 and no patients with a score \u054680, scores of 60 and 70 were combined and evaluated as a single group. Crude mortality rates (not accounting for censoring or incomplete follow-up) were examined for PPS scores of 10-20, 30-40, and 50-70 (Table 2).\nTo examine the PPS's ability to predict early versus late deaths, ROC curve areas were plotted for survival at five times (1, 3, 7, 30, and 90 days after enrollment). These results (Fig. 1) suggest that the PPS is most accurate in predicting early deaths (\u05451 week). The PPS became less accurate in predicting later deaths and was only somewhat better than chance at predicting deaths at 90 days.\nNext, survival was examined using time to event analysis to account for censoring of observations due to discharge or variable periods of follow-up. In Kaplan-Meier survival curves the PPS was strongly predictive of mortality (logrank test p \u03fd .001) (Fig. 2). Using these curves, patients admitted with a PPS score of 40 or 50 had an 80% mortality at 6 months. For patients with PPS scores of 60 or 70, 6-month mortality was only somewhat lower (73%). Therefore, at least in this population, a PPS score of 70 or less at the time of hospice enrollment was associated with a very poor prognosis.\nUnivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated a significant effect of PPS score on survival (hazard ratio \u03ed 0.96; p \u03fd .001). None of the other patient characteristics described in Table 1 was associated with survival in either univariate or multivariable proportional hazards models.

Care planning under these circumstances requires that hospice teams mobilize services rapidly and respond quickly to meet needs that they identify. To do this effectively, it is essential that hospices are able to identify those patients who are likely to die very soon. Although the PPS is widely used in this way, its value as a predictor of prognosis in a general hospice population has not been adequately evaluated. The results of this study offer several important insights into the use of the PPS as a prognostic tool for patients who have enrolled in hospice.\nFirst, in this study the PPS was a valuable prognostic tool for use in patients who have enrolled in hospice. As a single-variable predictor of mortality, it appears to perform at least as well as the ECOG or Karnofsky performance status scores have been demonstrated to in cancer patients. 4,14 Moreover, it does so remarkably well in a heterogeneous hospice population.\nSecond, the PPS performed somewhat better as a predictor of prognosis in nursing home residents and in noncancer patients. In fact, it appears that the PPS offers even greater value as a predictor of mortality in a typical hospice population than it does for inpatients and patients with cancer, the population in which it has been primarily studied. [7][8][9] These findings provide further support for the use of the PPS as a prognostic tool for hospice patients, many of whom are in nursing homes or have noncancer diagnoses, or both.\nThird, these findings have important implications for determinations about hospice reim-bursement based on prognosis. In this population, the 6-month mortality estimate based on Kaplan-Meier plots for PPS scores of 40-50 was 80%. Even for the highest PPS scores in this sample (60-70), the 6-month mortality estimate was 73%. Therefore, for patients with a PPS score of \u054570 at the time of hospice enrollment, survival for greater than 6 months is unlikely.\nThis finding is particularly important because existing diagnosis-based hospice eligibility criteria 15 do not perform well. 16 Therefore, in discussions with fiscal intermediaries, hospices may find that the PPS provides useful evidence of a poor prognosis, particularly when a patient's score is very low. For instance, these results indicate that a hospice could predict with a high degree of certainty that a patient with a PPS score of 10-20 at the time of admission would be very unlikely to survive for 6 months and should be appropriate for hospice. More broadly, these results demonstrate that even patients with PPS scores of 50-70 at the time of hospice enrollment are more likely than not to die within 6 months. Thus even these relatively high functioning patients meet the general prognostic criteria for hospice enrollment. 17 There are at least two limitations of this study that should be considered in interpreting and applying its findings to clinical care. First, this study included survival data for only one hospice. Although this hospice's population is typical of other hospices nationwide in many respects, including its typical lengths of stay, a variety of other local factors may limit the degree to which these data are applicable to other settings. These factors, and particularly patient characteristics such as ethnicity, should be considered in future studies. Second, because the range of PPS scores in this population was truncated (10-70), these results do not permit an analysis of the prognostic utility of higher PPS scores. Although this is a theoretical limitation, the PPS distribution described here is similar to that reported in previous studies. [7][8][9] Moreover, it is unlikely that a typical hospice population would enroll significant numbers of patients with higher PPS scores. Therefore, these results should be applicable to most U.S. hospice populations.\nHospices face considerable time pressures to provide the best possible care to patients and families in the last days of life.

[1][2][3][4][5] Inappropriate use of sedation could cause unnecessary reduction in consciousness levels leading to poor quality of life. On the other hand, if sedation is not applied to patients with truly refractory suffering, they may suffer unnecessarily.\nTherefore, a valid clinical guideline for palliative sedation therapy is strongly required. This report describes a summary of the clinical guide-line developed by a Japanese national task force.

Determinants of the quality of life, dying, and death vary among individuals, and thus there are no uniform criteria. However, palliation of physical distress, peace of mind, feeling meaning and value of life, strengthening relationships with the family, preparation for death, and life completion are important factors for many patients and families.\nThis guideline stresses respect for individuality and humaneness, the necessity for reevaluation, and the responsibility of primary clinicians.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Development process", "text": "The Sedation Guideline Task Force developed this guideline, The members of the Task Force were selected from national distinguished experts, and consisted of five palliative care physicians, four nurses, two oncologists, two psychiatrists, two anesthesiologists, two bioethicists, a medical social worker, and a lawyer (Table 1).\nFirst, the Task Force performed a systematic literature review and obtained 114 articles. The full texts of all articles were distributed to the members. Because the evidence levels of the majority of the articles were grade 4 or 5 by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (2002), we decided to use the Delphi technique to construct the guideline. 6,7 On the basis of literature findings and clinical experience, six members drafted the guideline.\nNext, the draft was divided into 145 sentences, and all members were requested to rate the validity of each sentence on a 9-point Likert-type scale from 1 (not appropriate) to 9 (appropriate). The median value was 8 or more in 138 items (the difference between the minimum and maximum was 5 or less in 107 items and 6 or more in 31 items), and in the remaining 7 items the median values were 7 or 7.5. The median, minimum, and maximum values were disclosed to each member, and the differences in opinions were discussed and resolved in a face-to-face conference. Third, the revised guideline was divided into 137 sentences, and the validity was evaluated by the same method. In all items, the median value was 8 or more and the difference between the minimum and maximum was 5 or less. We determined that the major difference had been resolved, and adopted the draft as a provisional version by the Task Force after minor revision.\nFourth, five external reviewers selected from national experts who had not been involved in this project (a palliative care physician, an oncologist, a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist, and a palliative care nurse), five end-users (three physicians, and two nurses working in palliative care units or teams), and five bereaved family members reviewed the provisional version and provided free-form comments.\nFifth, after dissemination of these free-form comments to all members, the revised guideline was segmented into 137 sentences. In all except 2 items, the median value was 8 or more and the difference between the minimum and maximum was 5 or less. For the two items in which the difference between the minimum and maximum was 6, reevaluation of the revised items achieved the median value 8 or more and the minimum value of 7.

Thus, it is desirable to provide information in advance to patient and family about potential choices for refractory suffering, including sedation, if they want such information and/or the estimated benefits of the information disclosure outweigh the estimated harms.\nWhen patient will differs from family will. The care team should (1) help families to understand the patient's suffering and conditions by providing sufficient information and arranging an environment in which the family can attend the patient; (2) support the patient and his/her family in talking to each other and finding a solution that is acceptable to both parties; and (3) provide psychological support to families to relieve factors contributing to their conflicts, such as grief and guilt.\nWhile the patient and his/her family continue to discuss, the care team should explore treatment options to maximally respect the patient's will and to maximize the patient's benefits.

There is growing realization that spirituality and religion can affect every aspect of an individual's life. This effect may also extend to those patients with advanced disease. Individuals with life-threatening illness frequently strug-gle with fear, anger, physical discomfort, loss of independence, and troubling spiritual questions, as well as changing self-image, roles, and relationships. [1][2][3][4] One's spirituality or religious beliefs and practices may have a profound impact on how the individual copes with the suffering that so often accompanies advanced disease. 5 One study of individuals with advanced disease revealed that although they often had high religious and/or spiritual needs, they possessed low religious and/or spiritual resources to address these needs. This disparity placed them at risk for compromised adjustment to their illness. 6 In a 2-year longitudinal study of medically ill elderly patients, higher religious struggle (e.g., questioning God's love) was predictive of greater risk of mortality. 7 This suggests that negative religious coping can affect health outcomes.

The prevalence of the sources of distress, as measured by the NCCN tool, is displayed in Figure 1. Problems with mobility (\"getting around\"), pain, swelling, fatigue, and constipation were cited by more than 70% of patients. Distress was not related to demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, or ECOG status. As might be anticipated, distress was highly correlated with responses on the POMS.

Distress was also correlated with the emotional, and functional well being subscales of the FACT-G (p \u03ed 0.003 and 0.008, respectively), but not the physical or social/family subscales, nor the total FACT-G score.\nWith regards to their spiritual assessment, when answering questions from the FICA, 87.2% considered themselves at least somewhat spiritual, with 77.4% agreeing to being at least somewhat religious. The vast majority (90.3%) found this important to them (see Fig. 2 for the complete responses to the FICA). More than half (58%) responded affirmatively when asked if they were part of a spiritual or religious community.

These subjects were representative of the kinds of patients typically referred for palliative care services: moderately distressed, with major physical and psychosocial symptom burden, along with reduced function and significant caregiving needs. The majority reported that spirituality was important to them and they perceived themselves to be at least somewhat spiritual, with slightly fewer admitting to being religious. Negative religious coping (i.e., statements that suggested punishment or abandonment by God) in this group was positively associated with distress, confusion, depression, and negatively associated with physical and emotional well-being, as well as quality of life.\nThus, our study and others demonstrate that spirituality is vital to patients with life-threatening illness. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Yet, little is know regarding the optimal role of non-chaplain clinicians in assisting patients to achieve spiritual well-being. Patients in this study and in others want their doctors to be aware of their spiritual beliefs. 25,26 In many of these studies, fewer of these patients desired actual discussions regarding spiritual issues with their doctors and other health care providers. 27 This may be a reflection of the patient's concern that by discussing spiritual issues, the physician will be distracted from treatment of the underlying disease, or other factors.\nSeveral studies have asked patients specifically what types of spiritual interactions they desire from their health care professional. Several surveys report that approximately half of patients desire that their physicians pray with them. 27 This request is particularly controversial among clinicians because physicians are perceived as powerful figures and initiating prayer may be perceived as coercive by patients who may be unable to decline such an invitation. [28][29][30][31][32] When patients request prayer from their physician, nurse, or other professional, participation is possible if ethical principles are considered. 33,34 At the same time, clinicians should not feel obligated to participate in rituals that are discordant with their own beliefs but can assist the patient by finding someone who does feel comfortable. 34 The results of our study reinforce Pulchalski's advice that we as medical caregivers should consider spirituality as a potentially important component of every patient's physical well-being and mental health. 13 Unfortunately, clinicians are unlikely to focus on these needs, because studies demonstrate that spiritual well-being is rarely addressed by clinicians. 12,28 This lack of attention may be the result of insufficient training regarding spiritual care issues and efforts are underway to include spirituality in medical school curricula. 35,36 Future studies should address the specific benefits of including questions regarding spirituality during the initial history and physical, particularly when working with patients with life threatening illness. These studies should explore the optimal way to frame these questions to enhance patient and clinician acceptance.\nThe results of this study also highlight the potential negative aspects of spirituality.

Consultation by a spiritual care provider/chaplain with expertise in this area is critical, yet these referrals are frequently declined. Studies are needed to explore patient/family barriers to accepting these referrals. Additionally, systems need to be developed to destigmatize consultation by expert spiritual care providers.\nThis study was limited by its relatively small sample size and the fact that it was restricted to one institution, a large academic medical center. The cross-sectional nature of the data limits understanding these measures over time.

After identifying the psychological and physical health impacts of bereavement and outlining the prevalence of detrimental outcomes, we conclude that a minority of bereaved persons experience severe and sometimes lasting consequences, whereas the majority manage to overcome their grief across the course of time. We detail criteria for establishing the efficacy of bereavement intervention and examine the impact of intervention according to these stringent criteria. We critically examine previous reviews and summarize their conclusions. Using a narrative review approach, we apply a public health framework to organize intervention programs into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies. A comprehensive, updated review of empirical studies in these categories leads to the following conclusions: Routine intervention for bereavement has not received support from quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness and is therefore not empirically based. Outreach strategies are not advised, and even provision of intervention for those who believe that they need it and who request it should be carefully evaluated. Intervention soon after bereavement may interfere with \"natural\" grieving processes. Intervention is more effective for those with more complicated forms of grief. Finally, a research agenda is outlined that includes the use of rigorous design and methodological principles in both intervention programs themselves and in studies evaluating their efficacy; systematic investigation of \"risk factors\"; and comparison of relative effectiveness of different intervention programs (i.e., what works for whom).", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION D", "text": "O PEOPLE WHO LOSE a significant person in their lives through death actually need help from counselors or therapists to adapt to their loss? Do such interventions really help bereaved individuals to adjust? Such questions have been the subject of considerable debate and a growing number of empirical investigations in recent years. The issues involved are critical. Today, psychological intervention is more often put to stringent empirical test for its efficacy, and the implementation of empirically supported treat-ments (ESTs) is becoming a more standard requirement. 1 Bereavement intervention programs need to be empirically assessed for their effectiveness and associated costs to bereaved individuals and to society. 2 It is also important to establish that intervention efforts are directed to those bereaved who need and benefit most from them. In this paper, we examine the ability of bereavement intervention programs to reduce symptoms of grief, to prevent or cure complicated grief, and to mitigate long-term negative consequences of bereavement.

Nevertheless, before considering issues concerning intervention to enhance adaptation to bereavement, the health impact and prevalence of problems in bereavement need to be more precisely identified. There is, in fact, a substantial body of scientific research on the consequences of bereavement. 2,3 Bereavement can be viewed as a normal, natural human experience, one that is part of nearly everyone's life, even an essential element of the human condition. Studies have shown that most individuals manage to come to terms with their bereavements over the course of time, in many cases even emerging with \"new strength\" as time goes on and new challenges are mastered. However, it has also become evident that bereavement is associated with a period of intense suffering for the majority of individuals and with an increased risk of negative mental and physical health outcomes for some. Adjustment can take months or even years. Reactions are subject to substantial variation, both among individuals and across cultures. Furthermore, although most individuals eventually recover from their grief and its accompanying symptoms, for a substantial minority mental and physical ill health is extreme and persistent. Death of a loved one even increases the mortality risk for the survivor. This effect has been empirically well substantiated after partner loss and, more recently, among parents who have lost a child. 3,4 How prevalent are psychological and physical health problems after bereavement? Prevalence rates for the various health detriments vary not only according to the particular debility in question but also across investigations of different bereaved samples. 5 Consistently, however, in a minority of cases the psychological reactions are so severe as to reach levels equivalent to the diag-nostic criteria for mental disorder. A review of studies of pathological grief reported estimates from different studies ranging from 5% to 33% among acutely bereaved persons. 5 However, it is difficult to know precisely how to interpret such prevalence rates for pathological grief because criteria have not been established and the definition of pathological grief (also labeled traumatic or complicated grief) remains imprecise. At this point we need to be cautious in drawing conclusions about the incidence and prevalence of pathological grief.* With respect to other bereavement-related disorders, although 50% of a spouse-bereaved sample in one study reached the criteria for diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at one of four points of measurement (first 2 years of bereavement), only 9% met this level at all four points. 6 In another study, young persons who had experienced the violent loss of a significant person in their lives and who had no previous history of trauma had high rates for PTSD and acute stress disorder. 7 Of those participants, 22% met lifetime criteria for a trauma-related diagnosis combining acute stress and PTSD. With respect to affective disorders, 42% of widowed persons have been found to reach levels equal to or above the cut-off point for mild depression 4-6 months after loss, compared to 10% of married persons. 8 In this study, the depression rate declined to 27% after 2 years, still significantly", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "INTERVENTIONS IN BEREAVEMENT S-141", "text": "*Pathological grief is not (yet) a diagnostic category of mental disorder, and any agreed-on standard for diagnosis is so far still lacking (although scientists are currently working hard to validate classification procedures and come to better consensus. 32 This state of affairs is in contrast to the Post Traumatic Stress or Major Depressive Disorders categories that have established criteria and cut-off points in, for example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 33 Classification of pathological grief at present is frequently based on a somewhat arbitrary statistical cut-off point (e.g., the top 20% of scores on a complicated grief scale are classified as reflecting pathological grief). Another problem relates to the fact that there may be other forms of pathological grief than persistent, debilitating \"chronic grief\" that is closest to proposed DSM criteria. 3 Some researchers have described absent, inhibited, or delayed grief as pathological 34 categories that are also well-recognized by grief therapists whereas others deny the existence of such categories. 35 Jacobs and Prigerson 3 acknowledged that subtypes such as delayed or inhibited grief may not be identifiable in their proposed criteria. Following these arguments, we need validation of criteria and consensus on types of pathological grief before we can make firm statements about its prevalence.\nhigher than for married persons. According to Zisook and Shuchter, 9 major depressive syndromes have been found to occur in 24-30% of widowed persons 2 months after the death, approximately 25% at 4 months, and 16% at 1 year.\nResearch on physical ill health has consistently reported elevated rates among bereaved persons on measures of physical symptoms, doctor visits, use of medication, disability, and hospitalization. 3 For example, in one study, 20% of widowed (as compared to 3% of married) individuls scored above the cut-off point for severe physical symptoms 4-6 months after the loss. This rate declined to 12% after 2 years. 8 Mortality is a dramatic consequence in terms of risk; but in terms of actual numbers, very few bereaved individuals die as a result of their loss. 3 In conclusion, we can infer from the various prevalence rates that there are marked differences among bereaved persons, not only with respect to the intensity of their grief reactions but also with respect to the types of complication and patterns of comorbidity that they may experience. 10 Even though the severe effects on mental and physical health outlined above appear to affect only a minority of bereaved persons, the prevalence rates are of sufficient magnitude to cause societal concern.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Intervention: definition and efficacy criteria", "text": "To answer the questions \"Is intervention for the bereaved necessary?\" and \"Is intervention actually effective?\" we must first define \"intervention.\" The range of potentially available behavioral interventions in current western society includes crisis teams visiting family members within hours of a loss; self-help groups with the goal of fostering recognition and friendship; programs to educate bereaved individuals about working through grief; cognitive restructuring and behavioral skills programs; treatments involving the sharing of information, emotions, and support; brief group psychotherapy, as well as behavior therapy, hypnotherapy, and dynamic therapy. 11,12 It is useful here to confine the scope to consideration of organized or institutionalized counseling or therapy. Types of intervention for the bereaved vary from voluntary counseling for bereaved persons in so-called \"self-help\" aid to individual or family therapy programs designed to help when grief complications have arisen. 13,14 We focus here on help that is specifically aimed at bereaved persons (thereby excluding, for in-stance, palliative care, which is primarily intended for the dying) and that provides personto-person support, either individually or in groups.\nAs we noted in our earlier review, 15 the basic principle underlying any provision of intervention is that it benefits the bereaved person in terms of mitigating the emotional and practical problems that have been experienced after the loss of a loved one. Researchers must establish that the psychological treatments for bereaved persons have been demonstrated to be efficacious in controlled research with a delineated population. 1 As a starting point, reviewers need to set up stringent criteria to structure the evaluation of treatments, following as closely as possible the empirically supported treatment criteria provided in the general psychological treatment literature. 1 Establishment of the efficacy of bereavement intervention needs to be based on the following:\n1. Empirically tested intervention programs. Frequently, judgment is based on subjective assessments made by the bereaved persons themselves who report their satisfaction with the intervention program and its benefits in overcoming problems. Clearly, such reports are subject to biases. For example, dissatisfied dropouts are typically not counted; people may respond in a manner that is desirable, having committed themselves to continue in a program; and respondents may say nothing in terms of actual change.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methodologically sound research designs.", "text": "Major shortcomings in bereavement intervention efficacy studies still remain:\n\u2022 Control groups. Many studies still lack a notreatment-control group or placebo group comparison condition. 15 \u2020 Grief is a process that is expected to change over time, so if there is no non-intervention control group, it is impossible to attribute effects to the intervention itself. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the grief intervention may do harm rather than SCHUT AND STROEBE S-142 \u2020Alternative treatment groups provide a potential control group condition too, 1 but well-established interventions (i.e., those well-described and transferable, with treatment manual, tested, replicated and found effective, and accompanied by indications and counter-indications) are not available in the area of grief counseling).\ngood, an effect that also must be measured against a no-treatment control. \u2022 Participant assignment procedures. Assignment to conditions should be random or by matched assignment. For example, a comparison of accepters versus decliners of the intervention is not a valid assessment of efficacy, because there are likely to be systematic differences between the groups. \u2022 Consideration of nonresponse and attrition.\nBereavement intervention studies typically have low acceptance and attendance rates. 15 Yet nonresponse and attrition can seriously influence results and affect generalizability. For example, participants may be more depressed than nonparticipants. Those who drop out may be less depressed, may have recovered, or may have benefited least. \u2022 Reasonable levels of adherence. Absence from sessions or high dropout in control conditions can seriously bias evaluation of efficacy of an intervention program. Existing studies differ markedly in adherence, from hardly any absences to as little as 30% regular attendance. 15 Adopting the strict criteria outlined above for efficacy studies necessitates excluding consideration of several kinds of counseling: for example, pastoral care, intervention by medical doctors, and support from funeral directors. This is not to deny the potential importance of these types of intervention. They have simply not, to our knowledge, been adequately put to the test.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Reviews of efficacy studies", "text": "There are many individual studies and a few reviews on the efficacy of intervention programs in helping the bereaved to adapt to their loss. Some reviews cover the whole range of bereavement interventions for a variety of bereavements, adopting either meta-analytic and/or narrative approaches. [15][16][17][18] Others are more limited with respect to the type of bereavement (Curtis and Newman 19 focused their review on benefits of intervention for children), type of intervention (Jacobs and Prigerson 7 focused specifically on psychotherapeutic treatment), or specific bereavement-related pathology (Zisook and Shuchter 9 focused on so-called depressions of bereavement). Additional authors have provided secondary reports of the primary reviews noted above. 2,16 There are other similarities and distinctions between the major reviews, both in selection crite-ria and in the conclusions drawn about efficacy. We summarize and evaluate these reviews next.\nComprehensive reviews. Kato and Mann 17 focused on the efficacy of group versus individual intervention, using selection criteria that required random assignment to treatment versus control groups, similar recruitment procedures for both groups, and post-bereavement initiation of intervention. These reviewers concluded that there were methodological flaws in most of the studies and that neither group nor individual intervention had been shown to be particularly effective. Litterer, Allumbaugh, and Hoyt 18 provided an indepth review that also included meta-analysis but that did not impose stringent criteria for selecting studies. In contrast to the Kato and Mann 17 review, they concluded that intervention was helpful and, in particular, they argued for help soon after bereavement. The limited attention to methodology raises doubts about these conclusions. The overall quality of efficacy studies of grief intervention is frequently too poor to permit meta-analysis. There are huge differences between studies, making it extremely difficult to carry out detailed standardized comparison across studies. Furthermore, when meta-analysis is conducted, important information necessarily gets lost. For example Litterer, Allumbaugh, and Hoyt 18 excluded longer-term follow-up effects of intervention from investigation because too few of the studies included follow-up data. Yet this information is critical because the general aim of intervention is to achieve enduring effects. Litterer, Allumbaugh, and Hoyt 18 may have come to less positive conclusions about the efficacy of intervention had they included long-term assessment. In addition, these reviewers made no distinction between different types of bereavement intervention in assessing efficacy. An evaluation of which types of interventions help which groups of bereaved persons is critically needed.\nWe previously presented a narrative review 15 based on a public health framework, whereas other reviews have lacked theoretical structure. We based selection of the studies for review on the stringent criteria defined above. We also categorized studies into different types of intervention, following the well-established distinctions described by Caplan. 20 The review covered both short-and long-term effects of bereavement intervention. We concluded that intervention was differentially effective according to the degree of complication in the grieving process (as detailed", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "INTERVENTIONS IN BEREAVEMENT", "text": "S-143 below). However, we presented this conclusion tentatively because we recognized that methodological shortcomings were a major obstacle to establishing efficacy.\nLimited-scope reviews. Curtis and Newman 19 reviewed the efficacy of a range of communitybased interventions for bereaved children, reporting limited empirical evidence and considerable methodological weaknesses in designs. They concluded that the case for universal inclusion of children in support programs remains unproved. Jacobs and Prigerson 6 reviewed evidence specifically for the treatment of their proposed new diagnostic entity of traumatic grief. Because no interventions had been designed for this diagnosis, the review covered existing psychotherapeutic treatments. The coverage and conclusions were similar to those in our 2001 review 15 Zisook and Shuchter 9 reviewed interventions specifically for bereavement-related major depressive disorders, noting that the onset, exacerbation, or persistence of this type of disorder are among the most frequently encountered complications of bereavement. Surprisingly, therefore, they found very few well-controlled studies of the treatment of bereavement-related depression. Although evidence suggests that intervention could prevent complications in highrisk populations, no studies were available to establish efficacy specifically for individuals with past personal histories of major depression.\nSecondary reports. Jordan and Neimeyer 16,21 summarized some of the above qualitative (narrative) and quantitative (meta-analytic) reviews of the literature on the efficacy of individual and group interventions, primarily for adults, including a report of an unpublished meta-analytic review by Fortner and Neimeyer. Their conclusions were more in line with those of Kato and Mann 17 and our previous paper 15 than with Litterer, Allumbaugh, and Hoyt. 18 Evidence for the efficacy of grief intervention is quite weak. Most recently, Genevro 2 provided a concise overview, based largely on our previous review 15 and that of Jordan and Neimeyer, 16 and drawing conclusions consistent with those preceding reviewers.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Overview of empirical studies", "text": "For the current paper we updated our review of the literature to see whether problems with de-sign and methodology and shortage of studies have been overcome. We follow the approach we used in our earlier review, 15 observing the stringent criteria outlined above in providing a critical assessment of the available studies of bereavement intervention programs. In this section, we first summarize our previous findings 15 and then extend this review to include studies that have appeared since that review and meet the identified criteria. As before, a qualitative rather than quantitative approach is followed. Examination of the studies revealed that there are still an insufficient number of methodologically comparable and rigorous studies to use meta-analytical techniques.\nThe efficacy of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. As in 2001, 15 we subdivided bereavement interventions into three types. (1) General or primary prevention interventions are open to all bereaved persons, to anyone who has experienced a loss through death. Sometimes these interventions are targeted toward specific subgroups of the bereaved (for example, bereaved parents or spouses). Primary prevention is directed toward those who are experiencing uncomplicated bereavement. (2) Secondary prevention interventions are designed for bereaved persons at high risk, that is, for those who are deemed for one reason or another to be likely to experience a complicated form of grief. Examples would be death through homicide or the concurrent loss of multiple family members under traumatic circumstances. (3) Tertiary prevention interventions are targeted toward persons who are experiencing complications in their grieving process. Treatment of bereaved persons with depressive disorders would fit in this category, as pre-existing pathology is present. Treatment involves implementing psychotherapeutic treatment techniques specifically aimed to alleviate complicated or pathological grief and associated disorders.\nIn our 2001 review, 15 16 studies fell into the primary prevention category, although many were methodologically flawed. We concluded then that \"primary preventive interventions receive hardly any empirical support for their effectiveness. The rare positive effects that are found often seem only temporary, and sometimes negative results of the intervention have been reported too.\" However, we also noted that primary prevention for bereaved children can be effective. Fewer (seven) studies fell into the secondary pre-", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SCHUT AND STROEBE S-144", "text": "vention category, and results were somewhat mixed. Effects, if found, were rather modest, and there were some indications that improvement was only temporary. Screening for high risk seemed to increase efficacy. Finally, seven studies of the efficacy of tertiary prevention interventions were available. Most of these studies found positive and lasting results, although they too were often modest. In general, the quality of the tertiary prevention studies was higher than those in the other categories (e.g., pre-post control design). Importantly, in these latter studies, the provision of intervention was based on a request for-rather than an offer of-help.\nReview update. A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and PsycInfo databases identified 30 additional studies of intervention efficacy that have been published since our previous review. 15 Many are still methodologically unsound, a striking problem being the continued absence of control groups. Only seven of these newer studies met the design criteria and will be reviewed here.\nFour of these fell within the primary category. 22,25 Generally better results were found in these studies than in the earlier ones. \u2021 These studies also contrasted with earlier ones in that all but one used inreaching procedures: that is, intervention was given to those who requested it themselves rather than being offered it on an outreaching basis. Thus, contrary to earlier studies, participants in these newer programs were selfselected. The outreaching procedure used in the earlier studies was regarded as a possible explanation for the lack of positive results or the presence of negative results. 15 The newer studies suggest that an inreaching primary prevention strategy leads to better results. The one outreaching study 22 found positive results only with the high-risk group. Another possible explanation for the better results of the more recent inreaching studies was that they provided intervention later in bereavement (after several months or years), which had also been suggested as a more effective procedure. Further studies are needed to determine the relative importance of the time and inreach and outreach factors in contributing to efficacy.\nOnly one additional secondary prevention study was found. 26 In this study of children bereaved by suicide, those in the intervention group showed more improvement in depressive symptoms than those in a community-care control group. The primary prevention studies of Sandler et al 24 and Murray et al 23 also addressed secondary prevention. These investigators found intervention to be more effective for high-risk children and adolescents who had higher distress at baseline. Thus, there is now more support for the efficacy of secondary prevention, at least for children and adolescents.\nFinally, two recent tertiary prevention studies have been conducted. 27,28 Reynolds and colleagues 28 investigated the impact of medication and therapy (alone and in combination) on subjects with bereavement-related major depressive episodes (onset between 6 months pre-bereavement to 1 year post-bereavement). They found no significant effect with psychotherapy, whereas medication alone appeared to be helpful. Piper and colleagues 27 offered time-limited group psychotherapy to patients who had been bereaved on average 9 years earlier and who met criteria for complicated grief. This study is somewhat difficult to interpret because there was no nonintervention control. It was further limited by the fact that assessment was \"soon after therapy ended,\" so long-term effects are not known. However, comparison was made between two different programs (interpretive and supportive therapy), and patients in both programs improved in both grief symptoms and general outcomes.\nIn conclusion, the more recent studies are quite consistent with and confirm the patterns that we identified in 2001. 15 The quality of investigation has improved somewhat since the last review, and we identified a few well-controlled studies among the still large number of weak studies. More fine-grained patterns are beginning to emerge. For example, newer studies suggest that the impact of intervention is greater for girls than for boys. [23][24][25] Future studies should also examine the interaction of gender and type of therapy. There has been continued focus on the efficacy of intervention for bereaved children. Newer studies support our earlier, tentative conclusion 15 that not only secondary and tertiary but also primary prevention may be effective for children. 25 However, as Curtis and Newman 19 concluded, the case for universal inclusion in support programs remains unproved, and the basis for referral needs careful evaluation.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "INTERVENTIONS IN BEREAVEMENT", "text": "S-145 \u2021The efficacy of intervention in the Goodkin et al. 22 study is questionable. Significant pre-to post-intervention improvements were reported (sometimes for the control group too) but no significant interactions were reported, to indicate relatively better improvement for the intervention compared with the control group.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "GENERAL CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A number of implications can be drawn from our review of the efficacy of primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive intervention programs. First and foremost, the notion that routine intervention should be given simply on the basis that an individual has experienced a bereavement has not received support from quantitative evaluations of its efficacy and is thus not empirically based. This conclusion is endorsed by other reviewers 16,17 and by leading experts. According to Raphael and colleagues 10 \"there can be no justification for routine intervention for bereaved persons in terms of therapeutic modalities-either psychotherapeutic or pharmacological-because grief is not a disease\" (emphasis added). Similarly, Parkes 30 stated, \"There is no evidence that all bereaved people will benefit from counseling and research has shown no benefit to arise from the routine referral of people to counseling for no other reason than that they have suffered a bereavement.\" He went on to conclude: \"To be of benefit counseling needs to be provided for the minority of people who are faced with extraordinary stress, who are especially vulnerable and/or see themselves as lacking support.\" Children are likely to be a special case, perhaps benefiting even from primary intervention. However, indications are that not all children need or benefit from intervention, and strategies of inreaching and screening for risk would seem to be advisable.\nOur second conclusion is that provision of intervention soon after bereavement may interfere with natural grieving processes. Third, outreach strategies have not been shown to be effective and are therefore not generally advised. Almost without exception the studies with less favorable results have been those that used this procedure, while inreaching interventions have continued to show better results. Those who seek out and ask for help are likely to be motivated and to have trust in counselors or therapists. They may have suffered more and have a greater need for help. However, provision of an intervention should be carefully evaluated even for those who feel that they need it and who request it. Finally, the more complicated the grief process, the better the chances that an intervention will be effective. These conclusions all emerge from a comparison of the general effectiveness of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs.\nResearch improvements still need to be made.\nBereavement intervention programs themselves should be tightly designed, and studies evaluating their efficacy should follow stringent design and methodological principles. Interventions that are based on \"inreaching\" need further development to see whether efficacy can be improved to match interventions with an \"outreaching\" strategy. Furthermore, systematic comparison of the relative effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches is needed. We need to establish answers to the question, \"What works for whom?\" We also need better identification and understanding of \"risk factors\" as well as a theoretical frameworks to guide our research. Finally, American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines (including ethical principles) should be applied to implementation of grief intervention programs as well as to the investigation of their effects. More than a decade ago, Robak 31 criticized the bereavement research field for failing to provide empirical studies on psychotherapy and counseling: \"This is a troubling state of affairs, as it confirms an important discrepancy between science and practice in psychology and perhaps even indicates that practitioners are practicing without being informed about loss, death and bereavement through empirical work. . . . Not everything in print is research! Therapists, counselors, and educators should reexamine the database for their assumptions. Where are the empirical studies? They are not in psychotherapy and counseling.\"\nAlthough small steps in the right direction are now being taken, this fundamental message still holds. To create a body of sound scientific knowledge, the research agenda for the future must expand the number of well-designed and executed empirical studies on the efficacy of bereavement intervention.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Defining empirically supported therapies", "journal": "J Consult Clin Psychol", "year": "1998", "authors": "D Chambless; S Holton"}, {"title": "Report on bereavement and grief research", "journal": "", "year": "2004", "authors": "J Genevro"}, {"title": "Handbook of Bereavement Research: Consequences, Coping and Care", "journal": "", "year": "2001", "authors": "M S Stroebe; R O Hansson; W Stroebe; H Schut"}, {"title": "Mortality in parents after death of a child in Denmark: A nationwide followup", "journal": "Lancet", "year": "2003", "authors": "J Li; D Precht; P Mortensen; J Olsen"}, {"title": "Pathological grief reactions", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "1993", "authors": "W Middleton; B Raphael; N Martinek; V Misso"}, {"title": "Incidence and SCHUT AND STROEBE S-146 prevalence of post traumatic stress symptomatology in the conjugally bereaved. 3 rd International Conference on Grief and Bereavement in Contemporary Society", "journal": "", "year": "1991", "authors": "H Schut; J De Keijser; J Van Den Bout"}, {"title": "Corcoran C: Psychological outcomes associated with traumatic loss in a sample of young women", "journal": "Am Behav Sci", "year": "2001", "authors": "B Green; J Krupnick; P Stockton; L Goodman"}, {"title": "Determinants of adjustment to bereavement in younger widows and widowers", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "1993", "authors": "W Stroebe; M Stroebe"}, {"title": "Treatment of the depressions of bereavement", "journal": "Am Behav Sci", "year": "2001", "authors": "S Zisook; S Shuchter"}, {"title": "Counseling and therapy of the bereaved", "journal": "Cambridge", "year": "1993", "authors": "B Raphael; W Middleton; N Martinek; V Misso"}, {"title": "Encyclopedia of Mental Health", "journal": "Academic Press", "year": "1998", "authors": "M Stroebe; W Stroebe; H Schut; J Van Den Bout"}, {"title": "Encyclopedia of Primary Prevention and Health Promotion", "journal": "Plenum", "year": "2003", "authors": "R Hansson; M: Stroebe;  Grief"}, {"title": "Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological intervention for bereaved persons", "journal": "APA", "year": "2001", "authors": "B Raphael; C Minkov; M Dobson"}, {"title": "Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy: A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner", "journal": "Springer", "year": "1991", "authors": "W Worden"}, {"title": "The efficacy of bereavement interventions: Determining who benefits", "journal": "APA", "year": "2001", "authors": "H Schut; M Stroebe; J Van Den Bout; M Terheggen"}, {"title": "Does grief counseling work?", "journal": "Death Stud", "year": "2003", "authors": "J Jordan; R Neimeyer"}, {"title": "A synthesis of psychological interventions for the bereaved", "journal": "Clin Psychol Rev", "year": "1999", "authors": "P Kato; T Mann"}, {"title": "Effectiveness of grief therapy: A meta-analysis", "journal": "J Couns Psychol", "year": "1999", "authors": "D Litterer Allumbaugh; W Hoyt"}, {"title": "Do community-based support services benefit bereaved children?

Measurement plays an important role in end-of-life care, in clinical assessment, research, quality improvement, and an emerging use in public accountability. There are unique challenges to measuring the care of dying individuals, including the potentially insurmountable task of the inaccuracy of prognostication. Such challenges should be acknowledged but should not distract from the important goal of developing an authoritative base of scientific evidence to guide care of the dying and to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring quality of care for seriously ill persons and those who care for them. Using the context of measurement of quality of care, this paper highlights important challenges to the retrospective assessment of both processes and outcomes of end-of-life care, and provides research recommendations to advance the state of the science.\nOver the past century, both the physician-patient relationship and the experience of dying have tremendously changed. At the turn of century, the majority of persons died at home, usually of an acute illness. Now, the majority of Americans die of chronic, progressive illnesses often with prolonged periods of physical dependency. Death has become institutionalized, with a majority of persons dying in either acute-care hospitals or nursing homes. 1 Many persons die", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MEASURING END-OF-LIFE CARE OUTCOMES RETROSPECTIVELY S-43", "text": "within days after a transition from either location. Furthermore, the physician-patient relationship has changed dramatically from physicians' uniformly not informing persons of cancer diagnosis 2 to the now widely endorsed model of shared decision making. Indeed, care of dying individuals is very unlike that at any other time period. Preferences are very important to defining the quality of end-oflife care. 3 The vast majority of 46-year-old persons with acute myocardial infarction would prefer treatments to salvage myocardium or prevent a second myocardial infarction. However, the same statement cannot be made regarding the use of second-or third-line chemotherapy in a 76year-old individual with non-small cell lung cancer. Reasonable persons will differ on whether to use or to stop chemotherapy. Measuring quality of care for those near the end of their lives is not as simple as a medical record review that examines whether aspirin was prescribed. A key aspect to examining the quality of end-of-life care is the consumer voice.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CHALLENGES OF MEASURING QUALITY OF END-OF-LIFE CARE", "text": "Several difficult challenges inherent in measuring the quality of end-of-life care are overcome with research that uses a retrospective design. Several papers have attested to difficulties of prognostication 4,5 and its implication to public policy in the U.S., which is based in part on the notion that there is a recognizable and definable state of being \"terminally ill.\" 6 Key to the assessment of quality of end-of-life care is determining the point during a course of a disease and individual readiness when the goals of care should be redirected to end-of-life needs. Simplistically, the question is \"Who should be counted in the denominator?\" 6 For domains such as pain, numerous guidelines attest that key to quality of care is the assessment and treatment of pain regardless of whether these persons are counted among \"the dying.\" However, other processes of care may be linked to whether a person is counted among those close to death.\nAt the crux of prognostication is the application of information from the retrospective outcomes of a cohort of similar persons to an individual person's future. Certain diseases and conditions (e.g., heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia) are difficult to prognosticate because of possible events such as sudden death or the development of pneumonia. Such concern, in part, is an argument for the use of the retrospective or mortality follow-back approach. With this approach, the denominator is clearly defined because deaths are required by law to be reported to state department of health.\nIt should be noted that methodological challenges beset both prospective and retrospective data collection. An argument claiming that one method is superior is wrong. Rather, multiple methods, either combined or in sequence, are needed to examine a complex, multidimensional phenomenon such as end-of-life care.\nEven if the issue of prognostication could be resolved, respondent burden and nonresponse are important limitations to a prospective approach to examining the quality of care in the last months and days of life. Among seriously ill hospitalized adults, Wenger and colleagues found that 40% were not able to be interviewed in the Study to Understand Prognosis and Preference for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUP-PORT). 8 Those unable to be interviewed were the sickest patients, often closest to death. Two studies conducted in the United Kingdom found that only one third of palliative care patients could complete a brief assessment using the Palliative Care Outcome Scale. A similar percentage of cancer patients in a London hospital were not well enough to be interviewed. 9,10 A key advantage of the retrospective assessment is that the denominator is clearly defined and the nonresponse bias of being unable to collect information on the sickest persons is minimized.\nAn additional advantage of the retrospective or \"mortality follow-back\" approach is that it is cost-effective and one does not have to review medical records to identify those persons \"at risk for dying\" or to conduct multiple interviews in an attempt to collect data in a similar time period. This mortality follow-back approach involves attempting to contact the informant or \"next of kin\" listed on a death certificate to identify an appropriate respondent, usually the person who was involved in decision making and who knew best about the decedent's last month or year of life.\nSix National Mortality Follow-back surveys have been conducted in the U.S., providing valuable information on the dying experience including functional trajectory and the site of death, 11 quality of life in the last year of life, 12 and use of hospice services. 13 To date, only one investigatorinitiated study has attempted to use a national sample of death certificates to identify key informants whose aggregated reports could characterize the experience of dying in the U.S. 14 In this study, respondents (usually close family members), were asked to act as proxies for the decedents by reporting the decedents' experience as they understood it from the decedents or based on their direct observations, and to report their own experience. Despite the widespread use of the mortality follow-back survey to elucidate the quality of end of life, there remain important research questions regarding its use in characterizing the quality of care of dying individuals.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "WHAT IS QUALITY OF END-OF-LIFE CARE?", "text": "Since SUPPORT, 15 progress has been made in the definition and the development of measurement tools to examine the quality of end-of-life care. An important stimulus to the development of new instruments was funding that was available from several foundations. It allowed three conferences to be held at the J. Erik Johnson Woods Hole Center of the National Academy of Sciences compound (Woods Hole, MA). These conferences brought together scientists, health care providers, and leaders in the hospice industry. 16,17 Similar to conferences held to define and stimulate measures of quality of life, 18 the forum provided an invaluable stimulus for pursuit of complementary yet different measures of end-oflife care.\nSeveral proposed definitions and instruments have been developed to examine the quality of care, [19][20][21][22][23][24][25] quality of life for dying persons, [26][27][28][29] and quality of death and dying. 30 It is somewhat reassuring that there is substantial agreement on key domains (e.g., physical comfort and emotional support, shared decision making, communication, support to family members, and access to care). However, there are also differences.\nLife closure is one outcome indicator in which current differences suggest the need for further investigation. Teno and colleagues 19 developed an after-death instrument (now the Family Evaluation of Hospice Care, used by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization) which focuses on providing actionable feedback to monitor and improve the quality of end-of-life care. In the cognitive testing phase of this study, some respondents expressed concerns about whether they would want a health care provider to discuss closure or life completion, as well as concerns about their ability to report on this.

Much work remains to be done. Proposed conceptual models should be examined with different ethnicities and instruments accordingly adapted. Instruments should be translated to different languages and revalidated. Research is needed to understand the inter-relationship of the domains and their association with overall satisfaction with the quality of care. Although cross-sectional construct validity has been reported, research needs to examine the ability of these instruments to detect clinically meaningful changes with system interventions. Such research will benefit future studies using both prospective and retrospective designs.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ARE PROXIES RELIABLE AND VALID?", "text": "There are important concerns about the reliability and validity of the proxy report during a period of bereavement. 17,34,35 A key concern is the validity and reliability of bereaved family members' reports about the quality of end-of-life care. 36 Several excellent reviews have been written regarding the accuracy of the proxy and seriously ill persons. 36,37 Each of these reviews noted concerns about the validity of a proxy report for subjective states (e.g., pain, depression, anxiety) Tang and McCorkle 37 point out that the bias introduced by the use of a proxy is usually of modest magnitude. The bias of the use of proxies, for the most part, is that the proxy reports greater pain or distress than a contemporaneous assessment by the patient. For objective observations, proxies are able to report with sufficient accuracy. Although research suggests the need for caution in the use of a proxy for assessment of a subjective statement, careful consideration must be given to the competing threats for the validity of the study. As reported in the SUPPORT study, the exclusion of persons unable to be interviewed threatens the generalizability and validity of research findings. Excluding these persons from analysis because of the low reported accord of patient and proxy leads to a biased and nongeneralizable sample. Creative solutions are needed. One worthy of consideration is the approach taken in the SUPPORT study to calibrate the proxy response based on the multivariate modeling among a sample of cases that had both the patients and proxy as respondents. A sensitivity analyses was done to understand whether the inclusion of the calibrated proxy response led to different conclusions.\nOnly four studies have examined the concordance of terminally ill person's prospective responses with bereaved family members' retrospective assessments after the deaths of the patients. [38][39][40][41] The largest study, by Hinton, 38 found that for the proxies demonstrated poor agreement for symptoms when their responses after death were compared with patients' responses before death. Agreement about pain ( \u03ed 0.12), depression ( \u03ed 0.16), and anorexia ( \u03ed 0.09) were poor, whereas agreement about dyspnea ( \u03ed 0.51), nausea and vomiting ( \u03ed 0.36), anxiety ( \u03ed 0.43), and malaise ( \u03ed 0.79) was moderate or substantial. 38 A single-item overall measure of satisfaction had moderate agreement with a of 0.42.\nThere are two other concerns with the use of proxies for retrospective assessment of quality of end-of-life care. An important concern is whether bereavement affects respondents' abilities to recall events and whether their perceptions of the quality of care differ with resolution of grief. Comparisons of assessments made before and after death suggest that families change their assessments. Hinton found that proxies demonstrated improved concordance with a terminally ill patient prior to death as compared with concordance of patient prior to death and a proxy report after the death. 38 As noted by McPherson and Addington-Hall, 36 emotions affect a person's ability to recall information. An important concern with the use of bereaved family members is that the information given by these proxy respondents may be unreliable, as the responses reflect their own emotional states rather than the experience of the dying persons. It is possible that bereaved family members with anxiety or depression are more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the dying persons' medical care.\nSurvey research is now beginning to address aspects of questionnaire design to improve the accuracy of respondent recall. It is theorized that there are three types of autobiographical memory. (1) Extended events are those memories at the top of the hierarchy. This type of memory has a defined beginning and ending. (2) Summarized events memories that integrate frequently occurring events. (3) Specific events are at the bottom of the hierarchy and focus on single but significant events in a persons' life. 42 The best survey methodology to assist the bereaved respondent in more accurate recall of events is unknown. One study reported that using an event-history calendar improved reporting on employment, moves, missing work resulting from illnesses, and income when compared to surveys that used question lists. 43 Only four studies have examined the impact of timing of the interview in relationship to perception of quality of end-of-life care. 44 , [45][46][47] Lynn and colleagues noted similar responses when comparing persons who completed an interview early during bereavement as compared to those who were interviewed at a later time point. 44 Cartwright and associates compared the timing of recruitment at 3 months compared to 9 months. 47 Factual information is similar at both time periods, and no significant differences were observed for symptoms, help, or care received. Interestingly, there were more refusals at 3 months and an increase in difficulty of locating respondents at 9 months secondary to persons relocating with the death of a significant other. Casarett and colleagues 46 found no difference in satisfaction among respondents interviewed 2 and 6 weeks after the death of a significant other. One study, which followed 13 bereaved respondents, compared responses early (mean 3.9 months) and later (mean 8.5 months). Agreement for the frequency and severity of pain was poor ( \u03ed 0.22, for frequency and 0.11 for severity). 36 Anxiety and depression demonstrated a fair-to-moderate correlation. The direction of change was for reports of symptom frequency and severity to lessen during bereavement. To date, no study has examined whether proxies assessments of quality of care delivered to the dying persons and themselves changes during a period of bereavement.\nThe selection of potential respondents is another concern with the use of retrospective assessment. Mularski and colleagues 48 reported only moderate agreement (interclass correlation coefficient [ICC \u03ed 0.44]) among 94 family respondents for 38 decedents. An eligible respondent for this study had to visit the decedent for at least 6 hours in an intensive care unit. Eleven of the 20 quality ratings had a moderate correlation, as measured by ICC. As with previous research on patient proxy accord, there was a higher rate of concordance for objective items such as functional status and health care costs, whereas for the more subjective items (e.g., emotional state, transcendent items) there was a lower concordance. In the initial validation of an afterdeath interview, Teno and colleagues 20 found only 29 of 105 respondents stated that there were alternate persons who they believed could provide accurate information about the patients' conditions in the last month of life.\nA final word of caution with the use of retrospective design is that one must be cognizant of the difference between the case series (i.e., a mortality follow-back is an example of case series) and prospective cohort design. As pointed out by Bach and colleagues, not all persons who are believed to be \"terminally ill\" actually die. In addition, careful thought needs to be given to the time frames that each research methodology examines. It is important to point out that both methodologies have important limitations. As noted above, there are important biases that affect the validity of prospective cohort studies. The proper use of these methodologies acknowledges the limitations of both methodologies.\nCreative solutions and additional research is needed to examine both the prospective and retrospective use of proxies for seriously ill and dying individuals. First, studies need to examine whether screening questions can be used to identify proxies with higher rates of concordance. These studies need to go beyond reporting associations to examine the degree to which screening potential proxy informants could improve data accuracy. Second, the role of a proxy differs over the course of an illness. Studies must also examine whether concordance varies with disease trajectory or severity of reported concerns. Finally, bereaved family members and close friends are more than just proxies.

Two thirds reported one or more concerns with being informed about what to expect while dying. Nearly 60% reported using all or most of their savings in the end-oflife care process, and 47% reported that they found it difficult to cover health care costs. \u2022 More than one in four persons who needed home health services reported not receiving enough help, and those persons were more likely to die in nursing homes.\n\u2022 In an open-ended question regarding what would be the single most important thing that could be done to improve end-of-life care, 1.5% stated that a concern that was strongly suggestive of medical error (e.g., I wish the doctors had read the x-rays more carefully, so she shouldn't have had unnecessary brain surgery\"), and 3.1% stated a concern that suggested a potential medical error (e.g., a delay in diagnosis). Based on these data, we estimate that between 28,808 and 90,687 U.S. deaths per year may result from medical error.\nResearchers in the United Kingdom have also conducted a series of mortality follow-back surveys to characterize the dying experience. 23,47,[49][50][51][52] The six U.S. National Mortality Follow-back surveys have examined important policy-related questions (e.g., the disparities of socioeconomic status and race; the association of debility and use of formal health services, and the lifetime use of nursing homes), but only a few papers have addressed issues relevant to end-of-life care. Teno and colleagues 11 and Weitzen and colleagues 53 examined the association of functional decline and site of death. Greiner and colleagues examined the use of hospice among minorities. 13 Lentzner and associates reported the quality of life in the last year of life. 54 A mortality follow-back survey is an efficient means to collect national and generalizable information on the last days, months, and years of life. A key recommendation of this paper is that the National Mortality Follow-back Survey Program should be revitalized. This recommendation was also made in 2003 by the National Academies of Science. The last National Mortality Follow-back Survey was conducted in 1993.

Children with complex chronic conditions die differently (longer hospital stays, more symptoms, more procedures especially during the final 3 months of life) than do children who do not have such conditions. 11 Children with different types of complex chronic conditions have symptom patterns that differ by condition with some children experiencing two to eight troubling symptoms while dying. 7,[12][13][14] Available symptom reports tend to be from a single site or a single geographic region and thus do not constitute population-based research findings. Documenting the prevalence, intensity, and variation in symptom patterns by type of death will provide the basis for prioritizing troubling symptoms for interventions designed to prevent or diminish the symptoms and the suffering caused by them.\nDesigning interventions intended to diminish symptoms and related suffering presumes the ability to measure the symptom characteristics. The remarkable advances in the availability of psychometrically sound and developmentally appropriate instruments to measure the health status of well children and adolescents has not translated into such instruments for use with terminally ill children or adolescents. Recent re-views on this issue concluded that no instrument yet existed for most symptoms experienced by a dying child. 7,15 A concentrated focus is needed on assessing existing pediatric instruments for their clinical validity when used with terminally ill children and on developing and testing instrumentation where none now exists.\nCertainly, there are data from terminally ill adults regarding symptom profiles and interventions but such research findings may not accurately generalize to terminally ill children. Although scant, there are data that indicate children and adolescents receiving care in a pediatric intensive care unit died more quickly after life-sustaining treatment was withdrawn (86% within the hour) 16 than did adults who lived a mean of 4 hours after such treatment was withdrawn. 17 Children receiving end-of-life care that includes an experimental agent have also been found to have biological responses that differ from those of adults receiving the same agent. 18,19 Basing pediatric end-of-life care on the symptoms and experiences of adults is a tenuous approach and could have catastrophic implications for defining and providing quality care for dying children and adolescents.", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Psychological and spiritual suffering", "text": "The psychological and spiritual impact of a child's dying is not restricted to the patient and thus requires the extension of care efforts to include parents, siblings, extended family members, peers, and health care providers. The care necessary to address the psychological and spiritual suffering of children and their families needs to extend across time and stages of treatment, including bereavement. The clinical course of a terminally ill child can be comprised of periods of chronic strain as well as episodes of acute crisis, 20 which together are a source of unpredictable tension for the families, the ill child, and the child's health care providers.\nThere is little empirical research to inform palliative care providers about the psychological and spiritual suffering of children and adolescents facing death. 21,22 Children's understanding and processing of death depends on the level of their cognitive development and previous experience. 23,24 Based on clinical experience, the terminally ill child is reported to grieve loss of function and future 4 and to worry about being forgotten, experiencing pain, and leaving family members behind in sorrow. 25 Attention has been paid to determining the steps by which children achieve sophisticated understanding of concepts related to death and dying 23,24,26 ; less investigation has focused on practical issues related to alleviating the psychological and spiritual suffering of terminally ill children. 27 An important role of mental health professionals is to assess dying children for symptoms of depression and anxiety, although such assessment is rarely done. 22 Families make many practical adjustments in terms of time, money, and location in order to accommodate treatment of the terminally ill child. 20 During end-of-life care, parents can find themselves without the time or emotional resources to care adequately for their healthy children, 28 attend to other personal and professional responsibilities, 29 and manage the suffering of their sick child. 29,30 Siblings report feeling confused, uninformed, 26 and worried about their dying sibling's pain and suffering as well as having worries about other family members and even peers. 31 Parents and siblings show signs of grief while awaiting a child's imminent death. 4,20,28,32 Psychological suffering is further aggravated when the family's social networks are disrupted during a child's end-of-life care 30,31,[33][34][35] when a family or some of its members relocate in order for the seriously ill child to receive specialized care. 20 Future research needs to address the stability of social support for the patient and family from diagnosis through bereavement 35 and the mechanisms by which social support relieves suffering 33 in order to best develop and refine relational (supportive) interventions.\nThe psychological and spiritual suffering of survivors (parents, siblings, extended family members, peers, and health care providers) is concerning. Contact from health care providers is often noticeably absent (and missed) after the death of a child. 1,30,36 Although families transition to extended family, friends, and religion for support after the death of a child, the loss of the intimate shared experience between the family and those health care providers involved at their child's bedside is not inconsequential. A gradual withdrawal of contact allowing health care providers to support bereaved families without leaving them feeling abandoned and forgotten 37 and to assess family members for signs of complicated bereavement and make referrals for psychological services 4,34 is a model of care meriting evaluation.\nIn summary, while research on the identification and amelioration of physical suffering needs improvement, research on the psychological and spiritual suffering associated with a child's endof-life is markedly insufficient. Little prospective research has been conducted to examine the longitudinal impact of disease, treatment, and impending death on the psychological and spiritual well-being of dying children and their families. 20 Little more than clinical anecdotes are available in the literature to guide the practice and development of psychological and spiritual interventions. The development of such interventions needs to keep pace with the rapid advances in medical treatments that can foster clinical optimism and prognostic variability that makes a child's outcome uncertain. This uncertainty may contribute to a different profile of anticipatory grief and bereavement experiences.

Involvement of psychologists and/or social workers has been effective in facilitating the communication of such sensitive information and in turn with higher parent satisfaction with end-of-life care. 6,39 Certain factors, such as personal discomfort felt by health care professionals or a focus on cure or survival, may contribute to avoiding or delaying important conversations with patients and families about end-of-life care. 30,38 Discussions about do-not-resuscitate orders (DNR) have been reported as occurring only hours before the child's death, 14,36 when parents are already taxed with the emotional burden of their child's suffering. 22 Indeed, nearly 50% of pediatric oncologists who participated in a survey of members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology reported that they only initiate discussions about DNR orders after being prompted by the patient's family. 38 In another descriptive study, a major study finding was the existence of a 3-month discrepancy on average between when physicians and parents first realize that there is no realistic chance for the child's survival. 39 Furthermore, only half of the parents studied learned of their child's terminal status through direct discussion with the patient's medical care providers. What these combined study findings do not address is the possible existence of differences in parent satisfaction with their child's care when they initiate end-oflife discussions or when the health care team initiates such discussions. More research is needed to determine whether a certain parent profile exists regarding preferences for timing and content of end-of-life discussions. To the extent that endof-life care depends on both health care providers and parents reaching the same prognostic conclusions, addressing any communication barriers is imperative.\nCommunication about prognosis and end-oflife issues becomes further complicated when disclosure to the terminally ill child is considered. Clinicians generally agree that children should be informed about their prognosis and will benefit from open communication about their impending death. 4,25,[42][43][44][45] Such recommendations about disclosure are based primarily on clinical experience and not controlled clinical trials involving seriously ill children or adolescents. Most initial disclosures to the child about prognosis come from the parents. 46 Some parents, in an effort to protect their child and preserve hope, as well as to protect themselves from an unfathomable reality, will resist disclosing to a dying child. 43,47 In a recent retrospective study, 27% of parents who did not have end-of-life discussions with their terminally ill child reported regret, whereas all parents who did have such discussions denied having regret. 46 More research about disclosure (i.e., timing, who discloses, content of disclosure) and patient and family outcomes is needed. Without data to inform appropriate, effective communication procedures, it remains unclear when discussions should be initiated, what type of information should be provided, and how information should be delivered to dying children. Children differ in the amount of diagnostic and prognostic information that they desire.

Some settings exclude parents from such discussions up to 93% of the time and nurses at more than half of the time. 52 Some ethnic cultures prefer not to disclose prognosis to the child or parent and thereby exclude both from discussions about care options. 53,54 Care outcomes from including or excluding patients and parents from decision making have not been directly compared, and thus we do not have data to help identify characteristics of those patients and parents or other family members who prefer to be included or excluded from the decision making.\nParents report that end-of-life decisions are among the most difficult that they face on behalf of their seriously ill child. 55 Yet, an acknowledged gap in the decision making literature is how seriously ill children and their parents make treatment and end-of-life decisions and what factors influence these decisions. 56 The ability of a parent under duress and competency of the terminally ill child or adolescent to participate in decision making are particular concerns. To begin to address the issues of parent ability and child competency, interview questions derived from a particular decision-making framework (the descriptive-decision-theoretic model) 57,58 have been used in studies involving terminally ill pediatric oncology patients, their parents, and their health care providers. Study findings indicate that certain seriously ill children and adolescents were able to complete a complex decision-making process in which they considered more than one decisional element at a time and were able to integrate the elements into a decision when risk was involved. 59 Some evidence-based practice guidelines for end-of-life decision making are now available for pediatrics 54,60,61 and for neonatology, 62 but they have not been formally assessed in clinical care situations. Mechanisms to support the testing of these and other practice-directed guidelines are needed.\nInclusion in decision making may have profound effects on the quality of survivorship of bereaved family members. In studies involving adults (patients and family members) who are not terminally ill, the satisfaction with participation in treatment decision making influenced satisfaction with care and with quality of medical outcomes at the time of and for months after the actual decision making. [63][64][65][66][67] These data derived from adults may not apply to the parents of dying children but this needs to be determined.\nCurrent care options for terminally ill children and adolescents can include locale of death and type of care service, ie., hospital, home, hospital with hospice care or home with hospice, or other form of home-based nursing care. Differences in outcomes of these existing options have not been assessed, perhaps in part because of the low use of hospice care (less than 5% of all dying children in America receive such care). 7,68 Formal assessment of the effectiveness of different care models on care outcomes is needed. However, given that the majority of terminally ill children die in hospitals (estimates range from 50% to more than 80% of all dying children), 7,11 and that up to 90% of those deaths occur in pediatric intensive care units after a week of hospitalization, 69 hospitals have the opportunity to define excellence in endof-life care for children and adolescents.

This uncertainty likely drives much of the delay in initiating palliative services for sick children. Similarly, families often struggle with the decision to begin palliation in fear that such services imply that the search for cure has been abandoned. To accommodate the uncertain course of disease and to preserve the hope for cure while tending to the child's physical, psychological, and spiritual symptoms, the integration of palliative care and curative treatment has been consistently recommended. 36,40,47,70 Research about the interface and integration of palliative and curative, and palliative and end-of-life care, is very much needed to benefit the seriously ill child and that child's family.\nEthical concerns exist about including terminally ill children and adolescents and their family members in clinical research. Proposed endof-life research is carefully scrutinized by review bodies that weigh the potential risks (e.g., subject matter and timing of contact that could create or add to existing psychological distress, burdens of time and effort) with the potential benefits of new knowledge that could advance care of future children and families. Of additional concern is the ability of terminally ill children to give assent to their participation in research. Concerns have resulted in design alterations tend to include a more frequent reporting schedule to research oversite bodies, or an added follow-up component to allow a direct assessment of the effects of participation on the dying child and family members.\nConcern for burden on the child or family is merited but needs to be balanced by consideration for a child or parent's desire to participate as a way possibly to benefit others. Access to the terminally ill child or adolescent is essential to doc-", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HINDS ET AL.

Follow-up contacts immediately to several weeks after the original study participation with parent participants in end-of-life studies indicate that the majority of parents (ranging from 97% to 99%) report the experience to be valuable and deny regrets about participation. 71,72 In one follow-up study, 28% of participating parents did report being negatively affected by participation, but no detail about the cause of the negative impact was provided in the report. 71 These few studies involved parents of children with cancer and not the terminally ill child, and thus it is not certain that the findings apply to parents whose child died of other causes.\nClinicians have reported a self-perception of being insufficiently prepared to provide end-oflife care to children and to their family members, having relied upon trial-and-error methods to learn such care strategies. 38 Doubts about their abilities to address adequately patient and family suffering has contributed to some health care professionals exiting from their discipline or from involvement with dying children. 9 Similarly, prognostication accuracy of a child's death remains difficult. Prognostication relies upon sensitive clinical knowing, scientific knowledge about predictors of fatal outcome, and clinical wisdom. This skill could significantly contribute to facilitating a \"good death\" by providing the dying child, adolescent, family, and care providers the opportunity to begin preparing for the child's death. Preparation will mean different behaviors, thoughts, and plans for each individual involved.\nAccurate prognostication may be further complicated by an implicit health care practice belief that with enough effort, research, and expertise, the lives of very ill children can be savedwhether that means that the illness is cured, the injuries repaired, or the threat to life is controlled. 73 But children are dying. The proportion of children living with chronic, irreversible disease processes continues to rise, with many of the children and adolescents succumbing to their disease. 74,75 Certainly more research and knowledge can save lives, but more knowledge about dying can make possible the so-called good death for those children who will die. Health care professionals are quite receptive to opportunities to learn about end of life care .46 Formal end-of-life care curricula have been developed and are at this time discipline-specific End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC; EPEC). These curricula have been very well received but an extension of their success to include different and multiple disciplines (as is reflected in the newer IPPC model) would more accurately simulate real clinical care. The educational impact and clinical outcomes of discipline-specific curricula compared to the same from an interdisciplinary curriculum might be quite revealing. The principles made explicit in the developed curricula have seeming applicability to multiple disciplines, and thus it may require minor revisions to offer the existing curricula for endof-life care to an interdisciplinary group.\nA final area of opportunity to facilitate a good death for children and adolescents who will die of disease or trauma is to identify through systematic processes the indicators of quality endof-life care. These indicators could help to guide health care providers in their care efforts so that they may not have to rely upon trial-and-error learning and could persuade health care settings that excellence in end-of-life care can be defined, made explicit, and thus be achieved.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Significant challenges exist to conducting the critically needed research on dying children and adolescents and their families, to implementing clinical demonstration models of excellence of end-of-life care, and to testing the few available evidence-based practice guidelines related to end-of-life care.

However, prediction of survival is difficult, particularly with critically ill and dying patients within the hospitals. The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) was designed to assess functional status and measure progressive decline in palliative care patients, yet it has not been validated within hospital health care settings. Objective: This study explores the application of the PPS for its predictive ability related to length of survival. Other variables examined were correlates of symptom distress in a tertiary academic setting. Methods: Patients were assigned a score on the PPS ranging from 0% to 100% at initial consultation. Standardized symptom assessments were carried out daily, and survival was determined by medical record review and search of the National Death Index. Results: Of 261 patients seen since January 2002, 157 had cancer and 104 had other diagnoses. PPS scores ranged from 10% to 80% with 92% of the scores between 10% and 40%. Survival ranged from 0 to 30 months, with a median of 9 days. By 90 days, 83% of patients had died. Proportional hazards regression estimates showed that a 10% decrement in PPS score was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-1.92). Proportional odds regression models showed that a lower PPS was significantly associated with higher levels of dyspnea.The PPS correlated well with length of survival and with select symptom distress scores.

In palliative care, patients pose a great challenge to caregivers because dynamic changes in their physical condition and overall performance status make accurate prognostication of time to death difficult.\nThe commonly used prognostic tools such as the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) do not take into account the continued changes in oral intake and level of consciousness once a patient is bedridden. 3 Scales for the palliative care population need to parse this part of the patient's life more finely. Such a scale for this patient population is the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), which is a derivative of the KPS. 3 In the PPS the use of hospitalization is removed as a criterion for a lower score. The PPS incorporates five observer-rated parameters (ambulation, activity, self-care, intake, and level of consciousness). The scale grades a patient's general condition as 0% (dead) to 100% (normal) in increments of 10 percentage points. 3 Previous studies have looked at survival prediction using the PPS. [4][5][6] Originally the scale was developed and used in Victoria, British Columbia, in a population that consisted of both homebased patients as well as patients admitted to a hospice unit. 3 Morita et al. 4 and Bruera et al. 5 conducted similar studies of survival prediction using the PPS were conducted on patients admitted to a palliative care unit. Although the PPS was developed for use with this patient population, it has not yet been validated within hospital acute health care settings. 1,3,[6][7][8] Clinical symptoms play a large role in various prognostic tools. Acuity measurement tools such as the McCorkle symptom distress scale 9 and others have been developed to rate severity of patient symptoms. Several investigators 4,5,10 have identified various symptoms/signs that are independent predictors of survival or prognostic indicators in their studies. However, none of these signs or symptoms has been compared to the PPS as predictors of survival.\nTherefore, we conducted a study looking at the application of the PPS for its predictive ability related to length of survival as well as the relationship of the PPS to a variety of correlates of symptom distress to determine if clinical symptoms could be associated with survival or functional status in an inpatient patient population at a U.S teaching hospital that was seen on a consultative palliative care service.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Patients", "text": "Between February 12, 2002 and July 31, 2004, a total of 310 adult inpatients with advanced cancer or other advanced (life-limiting) diseases were seen in consultation at the request of their primary physician teams by the Pain and Symptom Consult service at the University of North Carolina (UNC).

Among the 261 patients analyzed, the PPS scores ranged from 10% to 80%, with 92% of the scores between  10% and 40%. The PPS score for each patient was: a score of 10 in 24%, a score of 20 in 29%, a score of 30 in 25%, a score of 40 in 14%, a score of 50 in 3.7%, a score of 60 in 1.65%, a score of 70 in 1.65% and a score of 80 in 1%. Table 1 summarizes the patients' characteristics. The majority (60%) of all patients seen had a diagnosis of cancer. Patients were followed for a median of 9 days (quartiles 3 and 41 days). The PPS distribution by diagnosis is shown in Figure 1. Kaplan Meier estimates of survival by PPS are shown in Figure 2. Three distinct survival groups were identified based on various ranges of the PPS (10-20; 30-40; \u0546 50). Because only a few patients had a PPS score of 50 and above (n \u03ed 20), these patients were evaluated as a single group. The length of follow-up and status at the end of follow-up is known for 250 patients. Survival or follow-up time, defined as the number of days from the date of interview to the date of death (n \u03ed 228) or date of study termination (n \u03ed 22), whichever occurred first, ranged from 0 to 911, with a median of 9 days (quartiles 3 and 41 days). Eleven patients had missing follow-up information. By 90 days, 83% of the patients had died. Some cases were censored as these patients were still alive and under follow-up at time of study termination.\nAs seen in Table 2, estimates from a proportional hazard multiple regression model for survival show that having a PPS score that is 10% lower is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.42-1.92) after adjusting for the four symptom variables (dyspnea, agitated delirium, fatigue, and pain). This remains true when compared by self-rater (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.31-1.9) or proxy (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.35-2.27).The unadjusted estimates were also very similar (data not shown). Because the scores on the PPS improve as they get higher unlike the symptom distress scale which worsens with each increase, the results were reported with estimates in opposite directions.\nTables 3 and 4, show estimates from a proportional odds multiple regression model for PPS. When the model included all patients, a lower PPS was significantly associated with higher levels of dyspnea (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.86) and agitated delirium (odds ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.90).

It has been adopted by a few centers with dedicated palliative care programs. However, physicians in the majority of U.S. tertiary hospitals do not have a dedicated palliative care unit to which to refer these patients. Previous studies have shown that physicians' estimation of prognosis tends to be inaccurate. 11,12 Therefore, a more uniform way of prognosticating outcome in these patients would involve the use of a scale such as the PPS. However, the survival predictability of this scale has not previously been tested solely in an acute tertiary care setting.\nSince the inception of the PPS in Victoria, British Columbia, several investigators have conducted validation studies of the PPS as a correlate to survival. Review of six studies (including the current study) shows varied populations with differing median survivals despite similar PPS  scores (Table 5). This is the only study conducted solely in an acute tertiary care center. In this study, we assessed the validity of the PPS in predicting survival of inpatient palliative care patients in a tertiary care hospital, using a single PPS score at the time of initial evaluation. Studies among inpatient hospice populations have shown that the PPS is predictive of survival. 4,6,7 Other studies have looked at heterogeneous hospice populations and arrived at similar results. 1,8 The common finding in these studies including ours is that there is a difference in survival patterns among various groups of PPS scores. These survival patterns vary from study to study possibly due to different patient numbers within the various PPS score groups. The survival patterns in our study are similar to that of Morita et Al., 7 despite the fact that this group assessed the PPS at admission and subsequently, every 3 weeks until patient death. This leads us to infer that a single PPS score at admission is sufficient in predicting mortality. This is important because in the acute hospital setting, there is often lack of time and/or resources to evaluate serial PPS measurements. Here, the single determination may help inform the initial evaluation of the patient and the initial prognostic assessment.\nThe majority (92%) of our patients had PPS scores ranging from 10% to 40%. This skewing of the PPS in our population reflects the type of patients referred to palliative care in this tertiary-care hospital. However, despite their advanced disease, we were able to identify three distinct survival curves similar to previous studies. 7 The majority of patients seen also had a diagnosis of cancer. This may reflect the fact that physicians and caregivers are more likely to think of cancer (as opposed to other chronic illnesses) as a terminal condition needing specialized care with end of life issues. Although oral intake was not analyzed as an independent correlate of survival in this study, the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate shows a distinct separation between PPS scores of \u0545 20 and 30 in which oral intake is the major determinant. A person with a PPS of 30% is totally bed-bound, unable to do any activity, and has extensive disease. They require total care; have normal or reduced oral intake; and are either fully conscious or drowsy with or without confusion. A person with a PPS of 20% is only different in that oral intake level is minimal to sips. 3 In future studies, it may be beneficial to specifically correlate the level of oral intake with survival to determine if it could be used as a prognostic marker of survival. Several investigators have explored the possibility of identifying symptoms that are of prognostic significance. Bruera et al., 5 Morita et al., 4 and Flacker and Kiely 10 all found that level of oral intake is associated with mortality.\nOf the four measures of symptom distress (dyspnea, pain, fatigue, and agitated delirium) that we assessed, only dyspnea was found to clearly correlate with survival. While the association was modest, the assessment of dyspnea may provide useful information in addition to the PPS in formulating prognostic estimates. Previous studies 10 have found dyspnea to be an independent predictor of survival. This common finding of dyspnea as a correlate of survival independent of functional status may represent the terminal pathway of acute diseases such as sepsis, pneumonia and CHF which are common in palliative care patients. Thus, dyspnea may be a marker of the final acute illness that is superimposed at this point in the dying process.\nOur results corroborate Anderson's initial findings that the palliative performance scale is a useful tool in predicting survival of palliative care patients and is valuable in prognostication of disease. However, a critical limitation of any study of a prognostic marker is to discuss its inability to predict death accurately in an individual patient. The PPS is more useful to describe mortality risk across populations, but may not be as useful in an individual patient.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Prognostication in hospice care: Can the Palliative Performance Scale help?", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2005", "authors": "B Head; C S Ritchie; T M Smoot"}, {"title": "Trends in the aggressiveness of cancer care near the end of life", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2004", "authors": "C C Earle; B A Neville; M B Landrum; J Z Ayanian; S D Block; J C Weeks"}, {"title": "Palliative Performances Scale (PPS): A new tool", "journal": "J Palliat Care", "year": "1996", "authors": "F Anderson; G M Downing"}, {"title": "Clinical predictors of survival in advanced cancer", "journal": "J Support Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "P Glare"}, {"title": "Prediction of survival of terminally ill cancer patients-a prospective study", "journal": "Gan To Kagaku Ryoho", "year": "1998", "authors": "T Morita; J Tsunoda; S Inoue; S Chihara; O Ishimoto; N Hisaoka; M Itoh"}, {"title": "Estimate of survival of patients admitted to a palliative care unit: a prospective study", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "1992", "authors": "E Bruera; M J Miller; N Kuehn; T Maceachern; J Hanson"}, {"title": "Validation of the Palliative Performance Scale for inpatients admitted to a Palliative Care", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "K Virik; P Glare"}, {"title": "", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2002", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Validity of the Palliative Performance Scale from a survival perspective", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "T Morita; J Tsunoda; S Inuoe; S Chihara"}, {"title": "", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "1999", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Is the palliative performance scale a useful predictor of mortality in a heterogeneous hospice population?", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2005", "authors": "J Harrold; E Rickerson; J T Carroll; J Mcgrath; K Morales; J Kapo; D Casarett"}, {"title": "Development of a symptom distress scale", "journal": "Cancer Nurs", "year": "1978", "authors": "R Mccorkle"}, {"title": "A practical approach to identifying mortality-related factors in established longterm care residents", "journal": "J Am Geriatr Soc", "year": "1998", "authors": "J M Flacker; D K Kiely"}, {"title": "Extent and determinants of error in doctors' prognoses in terminally ill patients: prospective cohort study", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2000", "authors": "N A Christakis; E B Lamont"}, {"title": "Survival of Medicare patients after enrollment in hospice programs", "journal": "N Engl J Med", "year": "1996-07-18", "authors": "N A Christakis; J J Escarce"}], "figures": [{"figure_label": "1", "figure_type": "", "figure_id": "fig_0", "figure_caption": "FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1.

Draft papers were written on various topics concerning PST. This paper is a summary of the individual papers, written after two meetings and extensive e-mail discussions. Results: PST is defined as the use of specific sedative medications to relieve intolerable suffering from refractory symptoms by a reduction in patient consciousness, using appropriate drugs carefully titrated to the cessation of symptoms. The initial dose of sedatives should usually be small enough to maintain the patients' ability to communicate periodically. The team looking after the patient should have enough expertise and experience to judge the symptom as refractory. Advice from palliative care specialists is strongly recommended before initiating PST. In the case of continuous and deep PST, the disease should be irreversible and advanced, with death expected within hours to days. Midazolam should be considered first-line choice. The decision whether or not to withhold or withdraw hydration should be discussed separately. Hydration should be offered only if it is considered likely that the benefit will outweigh the harm. PST is distinct from euthanasia because (1) it has the intent to provide symptom relief, (2) it is a proportionate intervention, and (3) the death of the patient is not a criterion for success. PST and its outcome should be carefully monitored and documented.

In these circumstances, no effort should be spared to relieve unbearable suffering that may invade and dominate consciousness and leave no space for other things. 1 As a treatment of last resort, sedation of the patient may then be considered. 2 The available literature suggests that there are large differences between centers and countries with regard to the reported frequency of and indications for sedation. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Its use varies between countries 15,16 and may be increasing. 10 As with all end-of-life decisions, the initiation of sedation may give rise to emotions and ethical dilemmas. [17][18][19][20][21][22][23] When sedation in the imminently dying is used inappropriately, it may even be labeled \"slow euthanasia.\" [24][25][26] Clearly, there is a need for internationally accepted standards for sedation at the end of life.\nThere is a lack of systematic research on the use of sedation in the last phase of life. Scientifically sound research (in particular randomized studies) in patients receiving palliative sedation therapy is almost impossible as a result of methodological, practical, and ethical reasons. Therefore, guidelines on this topic will never be rigorously evidence-based.\nThere are a limited number of guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice. 22,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] Two of these were recently published as a national guideline, 32,35 some were developed at institution level by a specific task force 27,31,36 and others reflect the opinion and experience of the authors. 22,[28][29][30]33,34,37 The proposal to develop recommendations for sedation in the last phase of life was raised in 2002 during an Internet discussion on palliative medicine. An international group of palliative care clinicians from Europe (United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Finland), Canada, the United States, Argentina, South Africa, Israel, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, came together, led by the second author of this paper (M.D.). The aim was to develop internationally accepted definitions and recommendations based on the published literature.\nThese recommendations apply to patients with progressive and terminal disease with a life expectancy of days to maximally a few weeks. As the majority of the patients described in the literature and in clinical practice have cancer, the recommendations apply primarily to patients with cancer; however, many may be valid for patients with other terminal diseases as well.", "n_publication_ref": 51, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Procedure", "text": "The 29 members of the expert panel identified themselves on the basis of their clinical experience in palliative medicine and their interest in the topic of sedation.

Sedation in palliative care has been named in various ways, for example, \"sedation,\" 12 \"terminal sedation,\" 22,41,42 \"sedation for intractable distress in the imminently dying,\" 43 \"end-of-life sedation,\" 44 \"total sedation,\" 11,45 \"sedation in the terminal or final stages of life,\" 10 \"controlled sedation,\" 46,47 \"palliative sedation,\" 27,48 and \"palliative sedation therapy.\" [49][50][51] Although the term terminal sedation is most often used in the literature, 22 this does not convey the important aim of the treatment, i.e. symptom palliation, and it risks being interpreted as an intention to terminate the patient's life. Sedation is an option for symptom control, and is not euthanasia. 52 The panel found only five major articles addressing the definitions of sedation in palliative care. 32,41,[49][50][51] The panel prefers the term palliative sedation therapy (PST), because this describes the sedation procedure as a therapy. The term is also compatible with the present MeSH subject headings concerning palliative care. For the purpose of this paper, it is defined as \"the use of sedative medications to relieve intolerable suffering from refractory symptoms by a reduction in patient consciousness.\" This definition makes the aim of the treatment (relief of intolerable suffering resulting from refractory symptoms) and the nature of the procedure (use of specific sedative medications to reduce consciousness) explicit. The degree of sedation necessary to relieve suffering may vary from superficial to deep.\nSuffering and distress are subjective criteria, so only the patients can determine the suffering to be intolerable. 26,28 Therefore, the panel believes that it is reasonable that when patients express a certain degree of symptom distress, they themselves should indicate whether the suffering is severe enough for treatment by sedation to be considered. If the patient is unable to express his or her degree of discomfort and/or suffering, a proxy judgment by family members and/or caregivers should be sought. The health care team should be confident that the proxy expresses the (presumed) wishes of the patient and not his or her own.\nRefractory symptoms have been defined in various ways, for example, as symptoms for which \"all other possible treatments have failed\" 41 or for which \"palliative care is available but can not adequately relieve suffering.\" 22 However, the panel recommends Cherny's definition of refractory symptoms as \"symptoms for which all possible treatment has failed, or it is estimated that no methods are available for palliation within the time frame and the risk-benefit ratio that the patient can tolerate\" 28 as this definition can readily be used in clinical practice.\nMany of the drugs used in palliative care for the relief of symptoms may result in sedation as a secondary or side effect. A reduction in the patient's level of consciousness may be a temporary phenomenon and, in most cases, not intended, although it may be beneficial in a restless patient. For the purpose of this paper, we do not regard this as PST. The aim of PST is the relief of suffering and not the shortening of life. 5,22,23,37,41,42,48,49,51,[53][54][55][56] Lack of clarity and consensus regarding the intent of PST is a cause for concern and highlights the need for further research. 16,49,51,54,57 The intention of PST can be assessed by the proportionality or adequacy of the action. 48 In PST the combination and amount of drugs used will be sufficient, but not more than is needed, to alleviate distress by reducing the level of consciousness. Intent may be judged by looking at the drug record. Repeated doses, titrated to ease an individual's distress, are the mark of proportionate sedation. Single large doses are the mark of ignorance or intentional harm.", "n_publication_ref": 47, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PALLIATIVE SEDATION THERAPY IN THE LAST WEEKS OF LIFE 69", "text": "Viewing sedation (rather than the relief of symptoms) as the desired outcome may discourage regular review and consideration of alternatives.

This implies that the team looking after the patient has enough expertise and experience to judge the symptom as refractory and that there is consensus on this subject. Advice from specialists in palliative care or, if not available, more experienced colleagues is strongly recommended (grade D). 6. In the case of continuous deep PST, the disease should be irreversible and advanced, with death expected within hours to days (grade D).\nWithout exception, all papers dealing with PST specify the existence of refractory physical and/or psychological symptoms as a prerequisite for PST. A symptom is regarded as being refractory (as opposed to difficult to treat) when the clinician perceives that further invasive or noninvasive interventions are (1) incapable of providing adequate relief, (2) associated with excessive and intolerable acute or chronic morbidity, and/or (3) unlikely to provide relief within a tolerable time frame. 28 This implies a rigorous diagnostic approach, paying attention to the physical, psychological, social, and emotional dimensions of the symptom. 5,43,58 It also implies that all available symptom-targeted medications, procedures, or interventions attempted have been ineffective or produced unacceptable side effects, or, if considered, were ruled out as too burdensome or risky for the patient, or have been refused by the patient.\nAdditional factors may influence the determination of refractoriness, such as emotional fatigue of carer and family 12,28 and the values and preferences of professional caregivers 11,[59][60][61][62][63] and patients. [64][65][66] Several studies indicate widely varying practices of PST among physicians, based on personal factors, for example, philosophy about a good death, beliefs about the effect of PST on survival, medical practice, experience, religious practice, and levels of burnout. 8,11,12,61,[67][68][69] If a physician is unable to relieve a distressing symptom he/she may feel pressured to use PST, or even disproportionate sedation. There is some evidence that fatigue and burnout of physicians results in increased use of PST. 60,61 The perceived imminence of a patient's death may influence the doctor to prescribe sedation rather than look for alternatives. Other concerns include the wide variation in the reported use of sedation, 49 the proportion of symptoms that are labeled as refractory 70 and the use of PST in a patient who is incapable of making his or her wishes known. 71 Refractoriness has a temporal component, from both the patient's and the system's perspective. The practice of intermittent or temporary sedation recognizes that either a symptom might respond to continued or future therapy, 7,28,66 or that the patient's ability to tolerate the symptom may be improved following the rest and stress reduction provided by sedation. 19,28 Furthermore, the relative availability", "n_publication_ref": 32, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DE GRAEFF AND DEAN 70", "text": "of interventions influences the determination of refractoriness. 19 Consultation, whether local or distant, may supplement the expertise of the primary carer or team. [72][73][74] Transfer to a more expert setting, e.g. a palliative care unit, should be considered if deemed appropriate and feasible, and if desired by the patient.\nThe panel found 22 case series (totaling 936 patients) that described the symptoms occurring in the last days to weeks of life necessitating PST. 3,[4][5][6][7]10,12,14,55,[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] In these studies, the most frequent reasons for PST were delirium and/or terminal restlessness not responding to adequate treatment with haloperidol or other drugs (55%). Other reasons were dyspnea (27%), pain (18%), and nausea/vomiting (4%).\nPsychological and existential distress as an indication for PST is a controversial issue. 18,19,29,47,55,59,62,64,66,[88][89][90][91][92] The panel believes that PST for psychological or existential distress should be initiated only under exceptional circumstances and only after consultations with experts in this area.\nPsychological and existential issues may also influence suffering caused by refractory physical symptoms since in the concept of \"total\" pain (or any other physical symptom) psychological or existential distress may amplify a physical symptom. [93][94][95] The opinion of the panel is that the patient must have received skilled multidimensional management directed at the physical, psychological and existential dimensions of the symptom before a symptom is considered to be refractory. 27,43,96 Furthermore, emergency sedation may be considered for catastrophic events such as massive bleeding or asphyxia caused by airway obstruction.\nThe percentage of patients requiring PST for refractory symptoms varies hugely (from 3% to 68%) as do the indications for PST (e.g., 14 to 91% for delirium, 0% to 63% for dyspnea and 3% to 49% for pain). [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]97 These differences may be caused by differences in terminology, selection of patients (in particular with regard to diagnosis and life expectancy), differences in management and/or regional, international or cultural differences.\nThe panel found 10 guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice for the use of PST. 22,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] These used the following indications and conditions:\n\u2022 The presence of intractable/refractory physical or mental symptoms. 22,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] \u2022 Consensus of the (multidisciplinary) palliative care team as to the refractoriness of the symptom based on a state-of-the-art multidimensional assessment 32,35 and, in difficult cases, reached through a case conference. 29,32 If necessary, a palliative care or other expert (e.g. a pain specialist or a psychiatrist) should be consulted. 27,29,[31][32][33][35][36][37] \u2022 In the case of continuous and deep PST, the disease should be irreversible and far advanced, usually with death expected within hours to days. 27,30,32,[35][36][37] Decision-making and informed consent Recommendation:\n7. A systematic and inclusive process should be used, actively involving the patient (when possible and appropriate) or the designated surrogate decision maker and/or family as well as all members of the team that is providing care for the patient to determine: a) whether the symptoms are truly refractory b) whether to use sedation for refractory symptoms c) how sedation will be implemented and by whom d) how the patient will be monitored e) what criteria will be used to assess efficacy, safety and the need to adjust therapy f) whether to continue or discontinue concurrent therapies, in particular nutrition, fluids and medication (grade D)\nTo intentionally reduce patient awareness, even consensually, is a decision requiring careful consideration. Sedation may mean that completing the tasks of life's end are short-circuited or prevented. Initiating PST may lead to strong emotional reactions, not only of the patient and his family, but also of the professional caregivers involved. 98 The reported degree of involvement of, and information given to patients and families varies considerably 7,9,41,78,99 and the distress of the family members may be high. 65,100 Several of the published guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice state specifically that PST should be consistent with the patient's wishes and be discussed with the patient (if pos-", "n_publication_ref": 109, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PALLIATIVE SEDATION THERAPY IN THE LAST WEEKS OF LIFE", "text": "sible) and/or his family 22,27,30,32,33,[35][36][37] and that it should be made clear to the patient and/or his family that the aim of PST is to alleviate symptoms and not to hasten death. [29][30][31][32][35][36][37] Such an explanation clearly distinguishes PST from physician assisted death. 16,31,58,65,69 In emergency situations PST may have to be initiated immediately, without having the opportunity to discuss it with the family or the team. Anticipated emergencies that might necessitate sedation should be managed proactively by discussion with patients, family members and the multidisciplinary team. A management plan should be agreed upon, which may include the use of PST.\nDespite a relative lack of com-prehensive discussions of decision-making in PST in the palliative care literature, the following approach can be extrapolated from the literature on sedation for refractory symptoms 7,8,10,20,21,28,41,57,58,78,91,[101][102][103][104] and from related literature on decision-making in advanced illness or at the end of life.

Cultural perspectives will therefore have a major effect on attitudes to sedation at the end of life-for patients, families and health professionals.\nCulture is a \"living, dynamic, changing, flexible system of values and world views by which people live, a system by which they define identities and negotiate their lives\" 114 and may be applied to an individual, a family, a community, an institution, or any group of people who share a common characteristic such as age, gender, job, disability, place of residence or religious beliefs. It does not necessarily equate with race (which is purely physical) or ethnicity (which includes a psychological sense of belonging). Culture must therefore be viewed in context, as multiple factors may influence the individual or group in a given circumstance.\nThe use of sedation at the end of life may be influenced by the cultural background of both patient and staff. In a prospective study, large differences in rates of sedation and in indications for PST were found between hospices in Israel, Spain, and South Africa, which may be attributed to cultural differences. 5 There are considerable differences between countries and cultures in the attitudes of physicians with regard to patient involvement in decision making and in preferences of patients and families to be involved in this process. 40,60,115 There is a paucity of literature about cultural aspects of PST. Purnell 116 has postulated a model of cultural competence that may provide a framework for the determination of patient and family attitudes to palliative sedation. Important aspects of this model include:\n\u2022 Communication (including discussion of diagnosis and prognosis); \u2022 The role of the family in decision making 117 ; \u2022 Spiritual beliefs and practices (which may preclude PST) 90 ; \u2022 Health care practices (preferences for traditional remedies and/or refusal of medication, availability of medications 118 ;\n\u2022 Perception by the patient of health care practitioners (determining the role of the physician); and \u2022 Death rituals and preferred place of death. 119 In order to recognize and acknowledge differences in perspectives toward sedation at the end of life, health professionals must have a strong sense of their own cultural identity, including that of their professional role and place of work. Age, gender, religious or spiritual beliefs, and ethnicity are as significant for health professionals as they are for patients, within the context of the dominant culture. Health care professionals must have a sufficiently broad and open-minded attitude to enable them to forego ethnocentricity-the perception that their own culture, beliefs and values are superior-in order to accept the explanatory models of their patients, and to work within those models.\nThe interpretation of intolerable physical or emotional distress as an indication for sedation at the end of life might be a perspective specific to some health professionals, and not necessarily shared by patients, families, or other professionals, such as chaplains or others providing spiritual guidance who may have a different view of such distress. This emphasizes the importance of advance communication between health care and other professionals, patients, and families in order to make decisions based on patient preferences rather than the physician's own values. 120 ", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Types of sedation", "text": "Recommendation:\n9.

However, in two clinical surveys sedation was not considered as altering the patient's 123 or the professional carers' 124 perception of dignity. \u2022 What are the consequences of altering consciousness?-A brief episode of sedation requires a brief therapeutic action and leaves the patient the choice of further sedation. Moreover, reassessment of the indication for PST and of its efficacy remains possible, based on the judgment and preference of the patient himself. In contrast, judgment and preference cannot be obtained from a deeply sedated patient. If prolonged deep sedation is initiated, then the generally proposed option is to wake the patient from time to time (the exact period of time is not specified) in order to verify indication and agreement. 125 Some authors pre-fer that such \"awakenings\" should be planned instead of being performed \"just to see where we are\", 28,37 but other authors mention the risk of disrupting a fragile steady state that could be difficult to achieve again. 29,81,37 The panel regards the maintenance of communication and thereby the possibility of (re)assessment of the indication and efficacy of PST as an important advantage of mild/intermediate and/or intermittent sedation. However, preferences of the patient should also be considered and attempts at mild and/or intermittent sedation may fail because of progression of the disease leading to irreversible loss of consciousness.

[42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] There are no studies comparing midazolam to other drugs. However, midazolam has several advantages. It has a short half-life, it may be administered parenterally, it has few undesirable side-effects, and it is not only a sedative, but it also has anxiolytic, antiepileptic and muscle relaxant properties. The most commonly used antipsychotic drug used with the purpose of sedation is levomepromazine, often given in conjunction with benzodiazepines.\nPhenobarbital 13,41,42,81,136,137 and propofol 43,131,133,134 are used relatively infrequently, often as sedative drugs of last resort. Opioids rarely feature as sedatives. 78 Many consider opioids inefficient sedatives, with sedation occurring at doses that may be associated with undesirable effects; moreover, even high doses of opioids may fail to induce sedation. The panel strongly feels that opioids should not be used for the purpose of sedation.\nTable 2 summarizes doses of the more frequently used sedatives administered in the last 48 hours of life. Tolerance to midazolam, related to younger age and prolonged administration has been described, resulting in the need for increasingly higher dosages. 13,85,132,135,138 Nutrition and hydration Recommendations:\n13. The ethical aspects of sedation are separate and distinct from the ethical aspects of hydration; thus, the decision whether or not to withhold or withdraw nutrition and/or hydration should be discussed separately from the decision to initiate PST (grade D). 14. Nutrition and fluids should not be offered to imminently dying patients unless it is considered likely that the benefit will outweigh the harm. In a deeply sedated patient who is imminently dying, parenteral fluids are unlikely to influence either symptom control or survival time. If the sedation is intended to be transient or if deep sedation is considered for a patient with a life expectancy of longer than a week, then hydration may be medically indicated (grade D).\nNutritional and fluid requirements change during the course of a terminal illness. The need for nutrition and hydration may change toward the end of life, when the predominant goal of care is to ensure comfort in the period leading to a peaceful death.\nWhile there is an extensive literature about nutrition and fluid management in palliative patients with cancer, none of this relates specifically to sedated, imminently dying patients.\nThere is no evidence that artificial nutrition prolongs survival in dying patients, and in view of the associated risks, artificial nutrition should not routinely be offered to these patients. When sedation is proposed in patients who are receiving artificial feeding, it may be appropriate to recommend discontinuation. There is however a diversity of opinion about fluid administration. A systematic review of the literature on fluid status in the dying concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about either the beneficial or harmful effect of fluid administration to terminal patients. 139 For reasons of clarity, the issue of sedation must be distinguished from the distinct and separate issues of hydration. 30,48 The discontinuation of hydration is not a typical or essential element to the administration of sedation in the management of refractory symptoms at the end of life. Ethically, the withdrawal of death deferring treatments in the dying remains, for some, controversial. 140 Opinions and practices vary. This variability reflects the heterogeneity of attitudes of the involved clinicians, ethicists, the patient, family and local norms of good clinical and ethical practice. 41 Many of the review and opinion papers discuss the perceived pros and/or cons of giving or withholding fluids in terminal patients.

However, account should also be taken of cultural preferences and styles of decision-making. Although the provision of nutrition and fluids may be medically futile, there may be cultural and psychological benefits. If sedation is intended to be transient, hydration may be medically indicated.\nOne of the most difficult situations is where deep, permanent sedation is given to a patient who is expected to survive for more than one week.

Others would argue that giving fluids would neither prevent death, nor make it more comfortable, but merely prolong the dying process.

Where risks of treatment are involved, the risks must be proportionate to the gravity of the clinical indication. In these deliberations, clinician considerations are guided by an understanding of the goals of care and must be within accepted medical guidelines of beneficence and nonmalficence. The decision to act on these considerations depends on informed consent or an advance directive from the patient.\nThe use of sedation for the relief of symptoms at the end of life is open to abuse. There are data from several countries indicating that administration of sedating medication, ostensibly to relieve distress, but with the manifest intent of hastening death, is commonplace. 16,[170][171][172][173] These practices represent a deviation from normative ethical clinical practice and may accurately be described as \"slow euthanasia.\" [24][25][26] Such practices may be recognized by the use of large and sometimes single doses of sedatives, no attempt at titration (so that regardless of the level of distress the patient is rendered comatose), and infrequent or absent monitoring.\nSedation in the management of refractory symptoms is distinct from euthanasia because: (1) the intent of the intervention is to provide symptom relief; (2) the intervention is proportionate to the symptom, its severity and the prevailing goals of care; and (3) finally and most importantly, the death of the patient is not a criterion for the success of the treatment. 52 Despite this distinction, some critics of the use of sedation argue that the practice is morally equivalent to euthanasia. The essential core of this argument is that if both sedation for the management of refractory symptoms at the end of life and euthanasia aim to relieve suffering and end with the death of the patient, then they are morally equivalent. 175 Some argue that the discontinuation of nutrition and hydration in association with sedation for the management of refractory symptoms is tantamount to \"slow euthanasia\" by starvation and dehydration. 142,[176][177][178] This is argued both by opponents to euthanasia, who are concerned about maleficent aspects of the practice of forgoing nutrition and, in particular, hydration, 142,[176][177][178][179] and also by proponents of elective death who argue that if these acts are morally equivalent, then the more rapid mode of elective death is more humane and dignified. 22,180 The Principle of Double Effect is sometimes used as an ethical justification for the use of PST. Briefly, this principle states that when a contemplated action (in this case sedation) has a good (relief of suffering) and a bad (possible foreshortening of life) effect it is permissible if (1) the action is either morally good or is morally neutral, (2) the foreseen yet undesired untoward result is not directly intended, (3) the good effect is not a direct result of the foreseen untoward effect, (4) the good effect is \"proportionate to\" the untoward effect, and (5) there is no other way to achieve the desired ends without the untoward effect. However, this principle does not apply to the use of proportional sedation in the management of refractory symptoms during the last weeks of life because the death of the patient at the end of a long and difficult terminal illness is not necessarily untoward 13,21,180,181 and there is no evidence that proportionally administered sedation shortens life as several retrospective studies show no differences in survival between sedated and non-sedated patients. 6,10,[12][13][14]56,78,97,126,182 The median survival of sedated patients in different case series is 1-4 days.

The health care team should determine the appropriate intervals for the assessment of the effect of PST.\nMonitoring of patients sedated for symptom control at the end of life is an under-researched area. Some studies have been carried out on procedure-related sedation, 183 or sedation in the ICU, 184 but their findings may not be relevant to palliative care.\nAs the aim of PST is to relieve distress, then comfort, rather than vital signs, should be monitored. Monitoring and care will depend upon the level of consciousness. Attention should be paid to distress and sedation levels, adverse effects of sedation and the needs of the family. 7,65,98 Monitoring tools (e.g., the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale 185 and scales measuring communication level (Communication Capacity Scale 85,186 ), consciousness, motor activity and/or agitation, such as the Ramsay Sedation Scale, 187 the Glasgow Coma Scale, 188 the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, 189 the Sedation-Agitation Scale, 190 the Agitation Distress Scale 85,186 or the Motor Activity Assessment Scale 191 may be used, although their usefulness and appropriateness in palliatively sedated patients has not been proven. There is a clear need for research in this area. For measuring consciousness, clinical assessment (somnolence versus stupor versus coma) may be sufficient in most cases.\nOutcomes should be evaluated by the patient (if possible), the family and the staff involved.\nThe effectiveness of PST has been poorly studied. A number of studies mention \"improvement,\" \"success,\" or \"good relief\" in 90%-100% of cases, without specifying how the effect was measured. 41,42,75,76,81,87 Only two prospective studies systematically used outcome measures.

Cultural factors may play an important role.\nThe aim of PST is to relieve the distress of the patient; this frequently does not require reduction of consciousness to a level where communication is no longer possible. Thus, the dose of the sedatives is titrated against the relief of suffering (proportionality), emphasizing the importance of adequate monitoring of the effect of PST. Deep and continuous sedation is usually only necessary after failure of mild/intermediate and/or temporary sedation to relieve suffering and should therefore be the exception rather than the rule.\nPST is an unusual and extraordinary intervention that requires medical and nursing expertise and communicative skills of the various professional caregivers involved.\nBenzodiazepines are the sedatives of first choice.

Methods: In Pennsylvania hospitals, we completed semistructured interviews with 131 providers involved in decision making or discharge planning. We used qualitative methods to analyze transcripts. Results: Most interviewees characterized palliative care as end-of-life or hospice care that is initiated after the decision to limit curative treatment is made. Few recognized the role of palliative care in managing symptoms and addressing psychosocial needs of patients with chronic illnesses other than cancer. Interviewees viewed earlier and broader palliative care consultations less in terms of clinical benefits than in terms of cost savings accrued from shorter terminal hospitalizations. In general, they thought nurses were most likely to facilitate these consultations, surgeons were most likely to resist them, and intensive care specialists were most likely to view palliative care as within their own scope of practice. Suggestions for broadening palliative care utilization included providing education and training, improving financial reimbursement and sustainability for palliative care, and fostering a hospital culture that turns to high-intensity care only if it meets individual needs and goals of chronically ill patients. Conclusions: In acute care hospitals, palliative care is primarily perceived as a means to limit life-sustaining treatment or allow death. Moving consultation earlier in the hospitalization of \"dying\" patients is a greater preoccupation than increasing palliative service use earlier in the illness trajectory. Any move short of far upstream will require palliative care specialists to market benefits to patients and referring providers in ways that emphasize compatibility with parallel treatment plans and do not threaten provider autonomy.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "P ALLIATIVE CARE has been associated with better outcomes, including enhanced patient care, [1][2][3] facilitation of understanding of the diag-nosis and prognosis, 4 increased patient satisfaction, 3 improved symptom control, [5][6][7] decreased health care utilization, 3 and improved financial performance of institutions. [8][9][10][11] Particularly in response to these last two outcomes-decreased utilization and improved financial performance-palliative care consult services have become more common in academic and community hospitals. 12,13 For these programs to grow, referring physicians need to understand what palliative care is, what services it provides, and to whom. The specialty of palliative care grew out of the hospice movement in the 1970s and as such has been associated with care for \"dying\" patients, particularly those with cancer. Furthermore, hospital-based palliative care has been supported by administrators largely based on the expectation of cost savings accrued by decreasing length of stay or reducing per diem resource use associated with terminal hospitalizations. Thus, for many, palliative care is synonymous with dying. 14 Palliative care providers want to change this perception and encourage a broader view of palliative care as treatment focused on symptom relief and the promotion of quality of life among patients with life-limiting chronic illnesses before they are perceived as \"dying.\" 15,16 This transition \"upstream\" in the course of life-limiting illness is motivated by two issues. First, the uncertainty about when dying begins in noncancer patients has resulted in late palliative care referral and suboptimal treatment. 17,18 Second, many studies report high symptom burden, caregiver stress, and communication difficulties during both terminal and nonterminal hospitalizations among patients with life-limiting illnesses. [19][20][21] Opportunities to address a variety of care needs, including symptom control, psychosocial concerns, spiritual needs, physician-patient-family communication, and the needs of health care providers, may be missed if palliative care services are considered only when death is thought to be imminent or disease-oriented care has failed. In some cases, it is difficult to predict how long patients will live, particularly if they have diseases other than cancer. For instance, patients with congestive heart failure typically die of sudden arrhythmia and do not have a predictable terminal phase of progressive decline. 22 Thus, it would be optimal if palliative care were instituted earlier in the disease trajectory. Moreover, palliative care should be regarded as coexisting with diseaseoriented therapy throughout a patient's care. 23,24 As the disease progresses, the patient may decide to forgo some types of therapies, at which time the relief of symptoms and attention to psychosocial needs may become paramount.\nWhile there are some studies of how patients view palliative care services, [25][26][27] few studies have explored how physicians and other health care providers in acute care hospitals perceive and utilize these services. A better understanding of provider perceptions could inform efforts to broaden the use of palliative care by its proponents. To address these issues, we performed a qualitative analysis of the contents of our field notes and a sample of interviews conducted during 2-day site visits to 11 acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania as part of a study to identify organizational programs, policies, and practices that influence the intensity of treatment given to elderly patients with life-limiting illnesses.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "Our study was part of a larger project that investigated hospital-level variations in end-of-life treatment intensity.

The larger study included 20 hospitals. The chief executive officers of 13 hospitals (65%) agreed to their hospital's participation. Seven hospitals did not agree to participate: 3 failed to return our repeated telephone calls, and 4 actively refused.

To ensure uniformity in topics cov-ered and allow for valid comparison of responses, the investigator used a standardized interview protocol and specific sequencing of questions. Each interview lasted about 60 minutes and was audiotaped.\nAt the beginning of each interview, the investigator asked the participant to present his or her most recent case involving the treatment of a patient who was aged 65 or older and died in the hospital. Treatment decisions included whether to admit the patient to an ICU and whether to initiate processes such as intubation, dialysis, enteral or parenteral nutrition, transfusion, or cardiovascular support. The investigator followed up with questions about why certain decisions were made and whether they were affected by factors related to the patient, patient's family members, community, health care providers, and organizational policies, procedures, or resources.\nAt the end of the site visits, the handwritten field notes were typed and the audiotaped interviews were transcribed by a professional transcriptionist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Development of coding criteria", "text": "We initially applied the constant comparative method to field notes and semistructured interview transcripts to compare data and develop categories of responses. 28,29 As we read and reviewed the participant interviews and investiga- tor field notes, we discerned factors related to treatment decisions.

Their discussions about palliative care at the hospitals varied widely and included talk about palliative care training, curriculum, programs, services, teams, and specific experiences. However, from our analysis of notes and transcripts, we discerned four major themes: perceptions of palliative care, current utilization of palliative care, barriers to utilization of palliative care, and suggestions for increasing palliative care consults.\nPerceptions of palliative care. Most participants perceived palliative care to be a type of care that focuses on terminal pain and symptom management and on facilitating decisions to stop life-sustaining treatments. Some viewed palliative care as reserved for patients with terminal cancer, and some viewed it as care for \"actively dying\" patients (i.e., during the last days or hours of life). For example, one physician stated: \"[The patient is] on a non-rebreather mask in the ER, he looks terrible, and he looks like he's gonna' die. I said, 'Well, get him a bed in palliative.'\" Aside from nurses, not many participants identified palliative care's role earlier in the disease process. Conflation of the terms \"palliative care,\" \"hospice care,\" \"end-of-life care,\" and \"terminal cancer care\" tended to be at the root of confusion related to who should receive palliative care, who should recommend and provide it, and when it should be started. For example, as one physician and ED director stated: \"The patients are coming [to the ED] for medical treatment, not for palliative treatment. . . . The ['Hospice House'] is palliative treatment. They are . . . going there because, you know, perhaps they have intractable pain and they are near the end.\" This view of palliative care was based on disease progression (i.e., when it is \"time\") rather than on the need for services.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PERCEPTIONS OF PALLIATIVE CARE 103", "text": "In some cases, the participants worried that other individuals (physicians, patients, and patients' family members) viewed the institution or consideration of palliative care as a signal that health care workers had abandoned all hope for a specific patient. For health care providers, the options are sometimes viewed as \"doing everything or doing nothing,\" and palliative care is essentially viewed as \"pulling the plug\" or \"doing nothing.\" A number of participants viewed palliative care as incompatible with the hospital and ED goals of saving lives, and some surgeons perceived instituting palliative care as being \"soft\" or \"giving up.\"\nAlthough physicians rarely discussed palliative care as a supportive service that could be useful 6-12 months before death, nurses tended to believe that it should be available to all patients, not just as an option after disease-oriented care fails or becomes too burdensome and not just when patients reach the end of life. Nurses also emphasized the role of palliative care in facilitating discussions and decision making about goals of care and quality of life-issues that they felt treating physicians frequently neglected.\nMany physicians felt that symptom management for pain and shortness of breath was part of their job and core competency. Thus, they felt that palliative care consults in nonterminally ill patients were \"lateral consults.\" For example, one physician stated: \"Primary care docs . . . felt like they were doing an adequate job in this area. . . . [Palliative care] was something that was just a continuum of what they were doing. They didn't see it as another step.\"\nOthers recognized palliative care as a specialty whose practitioners can be called upon for various roles with actively dying patients, such as intervening when a patient's expressed desires are being ignored, dealing with \"difficult\" patients and family members who have unrealistic expectations about the patient's disease outcome, and taking the time to listen to patients and \"sort out\" what they want. As one palliative care provider described it, \"What we're doing is what everyone else is NOT doing.\" In this sense, many discussed palliative care consults as central to conflict resolution concerning care goals and decision making during the last days of life.\nCurrent utilization of palliative care. Among the circumstances under which participants felt that palliative care consults should be arranged were cases in which aggressive care was futile, end-oflife preferences were not being met, there were disputes over the goals or course of care, or there were concerns about high-intensity treatment, particularly in elderly patients. The focus of palliative care was getting the family or other health care providers to do \"less.\" The sense was that the palliative care team would be more successful in getting terminally ill patients and families to go along with a comfort limitation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Cases in which there was earlier consultation for comfort measures included those in which patients were stridently committed to comfort care, were competent, and were supported by their family.\nConsults are physician dependent. As one nurse indicated, the willingness to use palliative care \"greatly depends on the medical doctor\" and \"everything is very doctor-driven.\" Although anyone can informally suggest a palliative care consult, the patient's physician usually has to formally order it. In one hospital, physicians and nurses launched an effort to make it allowable for registered nurses or social workers to initiate a palliative care consult, but this effort failed. Participants suggested that reversion to the previous norm was due to intimidation of registered nurses by angered medical doctors.\nNevertheless, the palliative care providers whom we interviewed said they received a lot of \"anonymous\" tips from registered nurses and even radiation therapists who believe that a patient's care may be futile or inappropriate for ex-pected outcomes. This suggests that palliative care is gaining recognition, but primarily in negotiation of \"more appropriate\" treatment plans for actively dying patients. Some experienced nurses said they try to educate newer nurses about how to get a palliative care consult. They also try to push physicians to transfer patients out of the ICU if they are either stable or better served by receiving \"palliative care\" (i.e., comfort measures only). For example, one surgical ICU nurse stated: \"A palliative care consult is either nurse or family directed . . . . Often times it's the family coming to the nurse and saying, \"What do you think? Should we . . . keep going?\" And then the nurse kind of initiates a conversation, but based on a family member's comment. And then we will take that to the physician, but present it as \"the family asked me about [this],\" not as \"we need to talk about [this].\" Similarly, social workers try to alert physicians to psychosocial issues they identify, and generally the physicians are receptive to having these issues addressed.\nSome hospitals reported having high rates of transfers to their palliative care services from other units or hospitals when death is imminent. Sometimes the palliative care services admitted patients directly from the community. For example, they admitted home hospice patients whose families become afraid at the end of the patient's life. In one case, a woman had difficulties dealing with home hospice for her husband, a patient with esophageal cancer, but the hospice service said it would not follow the patient into a nursing home, so the patient was admitted to the hospital and died there.\nNursing homes in one city were fearful of being sued or accused in the newspaper of \"doing nothing\" for their patients who experienced changes in mental status and became difficult to manage, so they tended to transfer these patients to the ED. Many were subsequently admitted with terminal delirium to the geriatric psychiatric service, where a palliative care consultation was obtained. Additionally of note, when participants spoke about critically ill patients' needs, they mentioned relying on a variety of non-palliative care programs. Those discussed included ethics committees, pastoral care services, hospitalist programs, and long-stay review boards. For example, at two hospitals, medical doctors and registered nurses relied heavily on the chaplain, who served as the bridge between the family and the medical doctors.\nBarriers to utilization of palliative care. Participants were more likely to mention barriers to using palliative care near the end of life than they were to mention barriers to using it earlier in the disease trajectory. This is not surprising, given their perceptions of palliative care. Participants identifying underuse of palliative care earlier in the disease trajectory were palliative care providers or advocates, such as nurses, social workers, and administrators. They perceived that the biggest barriers to early use were the narrow view about palliative care's range of services discussed above and the physicians' concerns about loss of autonomy. More specifically, the treating physicians worried that palliative care providers would change the goals of care before the physicians were ready. In one case, for example, the attending told the registered nurse and post-call resident that the palliative care service had \"already done one thing he [the treating physician] doesn't like to do\" by stopping the tube feeds.\nWith respect to care near the end of life, participants frequently mentioned the following factors as barriers to their own or others' use of palliative care services: the pervasiveness of a culture currently geared toward high-intensity treatment; the concerns of hospitals and health care providers about reputations and lawsuits; the beliefs and perceptions of patients; the beliefs, experience, and medical specialty of individual physicians; and economic constraints that affect hospital practices and staffing.\nNumerous participants described the hospital culture as one that embraces only high-intensity treatment (e.g., an active life-sustaining treatment plan) and resists palliative care and comfort measures. For example, as an ED director stated, \"From the perspective of a medical doctor in the emergency department, we have a job to do and it is to save people's lives.\" And as an oncology and palliative care nurse stated, \"Even though [patients] are in palliative care [a designated inpatient unit], . . . we give blood, we've had people still on dialysis, we have people that are not just on 1 antibiotic but 4 and 5. . . . You have the patients at the other end, where it truly is comfort measures only, . . . but many have . . . aggressive medical therapy and they are still a \"palliative\" DNR.\nIn another hospital, the culture was described as \"very aggressive unless there is a written advance directive and it's very clear.\" In this type of hospital culture, patients and families were de-", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PERCEPTIONS OF PALLIATIVE CARE 105", "text": "scribed as expecting \"the best,\" which was felt to be synonymous with aggressive, technologyintensive treatment. The physicians' and surgeons' concerns about which patients to refer to palliative care services and when to refer them are often coupled with their individual resistance to transitioning from cure to palliation. One highranking surgeon, for example, said: \"Well, they don't call internists 'fleas' for nothing, because the flea is the last thing to leave a dying dog. Okay? I see people all the time in this hospital who have no prognosis who continue to get 'salvage chemotherapy.'\" Although nonphysicians perceived physicians generally to resist this transition, some specialists were singled out. In one interview, a participant described an oncologist as wanting to give \"another round of chemo\" even though it seemed futile to other members of the care team. In another interview, a social worker said of oncologists, \"If they can't cure them,\" they \"kill them\" in the process of trying. Surgeons were mentioned as the most resistant. As a nurse ICU manager remarked: \"The vascular surgeons will resist until the patient's totally mottled and the toes are falling off. They just absolutely will not ask for a palliative care consult.\" According to participants at one hospital, cardiologists rarely consulted palliative care providers and only did so after consulting neurologists and other subspecialists. In contrast, some participants viewed hospitalists as more likely than other physicians to initiate life-sustaining therapy but also more likely to withdraw the therapy if it was not meeting treatment goals. Some physician resistance stemmed from lack of training in comfort measures and the conflation of personal moral beliefs and treatment goals and outcomes. For example, one family practitioner said that he believed that there is no afterlife, so time on earth is the only time we have. As a result, he said it is imperative to do everything you can to keep a person alive so that they do not \"go into the void prematurely.\" Further, some physicians felt it was \"inhumane\" or \"unethical\" not to continue feedings, even if the patient had an advance directive indicating no enteral or parenteral feedings. As one participant stated, \"Even though they [the physicians] were receptive to palliative care, they still insisted on IV fluids.\" One participant felt that physicians who were \"pro-life\" were more likely to push for more intensive treatment.\nIn general, participants believed that young physicians were more likely to support palliative care and more likely to consider the opinions of nurses about the needs of patients, in part due to medical school and residency training with explicit end-of-life curricula. They believed that older physicians were sometimes better at finessing difficult conversations, such as those related to code status and transition to comfort measures, but were more resistant to high doses of pain medication and more concerned about palliative care consultants' threats to their autonomy. These physician-based perception barriers were largely cited as culprits in failed administration and provider initiatives to change relevant hospital standards of care. Additionally, though, proponents and providers of palliative care cited resource limitations as barriers to increasing utilization of palliative care. For example, one large urban major teaching hospital had only enough money to fund several part-time physicians and nurse practitioners in palliative care. Similarly, an academic medical center relied upon foundation grant support to partially fund the salaries of physician and nurse practitioner staff, and the providers worried that their own billing would not sufficiently support the program after the grant ran out.\nParticipants also voiced economic concerns about insurance reimbursement issues. In one hospital, a case manager explained that when patients were at the end of life and were transitioned to palliative care, the insurer would lower the rate paid to the hospital to a skilled nursing rate, creating tension between hospital finances and providers' perceptions of the patients' best interest.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Suggestions for increasing palliative care consults.", "text": "In most hospitals we visited, participants felt that palliative care services were underutilized (particularly at the end of life) and that change would take time. According to one registered nurse, \"Our nursing staff and our physician staff see palliation very differently . . . And the attending physicians tend to believe that they can cure a lot of patients, not necessarily of their chronic conditions, but of their acute event . . . We've been trying to re-educate, you know, yes, they're having an acute event, but they also have a chronic condition that should be managed and, you know, palliative care could help in that aspect.\"\nHospital staff suggestions included the following: arranging negotiations involving hospital administrators, chaplains, ethics committee members, and units with continued problems; providing workforce development, education, and training about palliative care; increasing the number of staff involved in palliative care; improving financial reimbursement and sustainability for palliative care; raising community awareness; and changing the normative hospital culture. Recommendations to increase end-of-life consults, particularly for withdrawal of life support, centered on the need to attend to frustrations with futile treatment, communicate with resistant doctors, and change the hospital culture geared toward high-intensity care. These motivations were commonly centered on potential cost savings accrued from shorter terminal hospitalizations rather than on clinical benefits. Although less commonly discussed, recommendations to move palliative care \"upstream\" in the illness trajectory or broaden its use included such strategies as incorporating palliative care providers into care teams for high-risk patients (e.g., heart failure patients being considered for ventricular assist devices) and mandating palliative care consults for all medical ICU unit admissions. To increase consults for actively dying patients and to move consults \"upstream,\" several physicians mentioned the value of role modeling and collegiality. They indicated, for instance, that palliative care providers might increase utilization of their services over time if they had strong clinical skills, were \"good citizens\" of the medical staff, were true to their word, followed through with ideas and programs, were highly reliable, and were not perceived as usurping consulting physicians' autonomy.\nFinally, to overcome the barrier of the prevailing perception of palliative care as the \"death service,\" several interviewees suggesting changing how they described their service. For example, one palliative care consult team began to bill themselves as the \"pain and symptom management consult service.\" Several palliative care providers believed that chronic disease management, a holistic approach, was a better description of what they did and possibly even a better name for palliative care.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "When we visited 11 hospitals and had fulllength interviews with 129 health care providers, we found that there were several common misperceptions that must be changed before palliative care services can be integrated and utilized optimally in the acute care hospital setting. These include beliefs that palliative care is applicable only in the last days of life, is antithetical to intensive care, is reserved for patients with cancer, is a signal that the physicians have given up on the patient, and would be a \"lateral consult\" because symptom management is within most physicians' scope of practice.\nAlthough we found that most participants knew that palliative care focuses on pain relief and decision-making guided by goals of care for patients near the end of life, few identified its role in managing other symptoms of life-limiting illnesses and addressing the needs of patients who were not actively dying. In cases in which participants felt that palliative care consults were initiated \"too late,\" they usually believed that limitation of life-sustaining treatment should have occurred earlier in the hospital course. Very few identified the initiation of palliative care consultation earlier in the illness trajectory as an unmet need.\nIn discussing the benefits of earlier consultation, participants were more likely to mention potential cost savings than clinical benefits. Indeed, hospital-based palliative care is promoted by the Center to Advance Palliative Care as a means for hospitals to reduce costs through shorter length of stay or to lower costs per day once the patient has been referred to palliative care. Generally such cost savings are realized by moving patients to lower acuity settings (e.g., out of the ICU) or by decreasing resource intensity (e.g., discontinuing treatments) and have as their hallmark \"doing less,\" particularly for actively dying patients. This professional marketing and the types of consultation it creates serve to reinforce clinician misperceptions of palliative care as a service reserved for those in whom all other (life-sustaining) treatments have failed. Ultimately, clinicians often view palliative care as \"death services\" because most hospital-underwritten palliative care programs were created for and thus cater to this narrow demand.\nWe found that most nonphysicians felt that treatment decisions, including palliative care consultation or hospice referral, depended almost entirely on the idiosyncrasies of treating physicians, rather than the clinical or social circumstances of the patient. In general, experienced nurses were perceived to be most amenable to palliative care service utilization, educating new nurses, and informally facilitating initiation of consults via families, residents, or sympathetic nonprimary attending physicians. Among physicians, surgeons", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PERCEPTIONS OF PALLIATIVE CARE 107", "text": "were perceived as the most resistant to palliative care services, fearing interference with their decisions to continue life-sustaining treatment. And intensivists often believed that they had the same skills as palliative care consultants.\nOur study had two limitations that deserve mention. First, it is possible that our findings of the conflation of palliative care and hospice care are a result of our interview protocol, in which we asked participants to begin by discussing treatment decisions made in recent terminal hospitalizations, rather than asking them specifically about palliative care. However, without prompting them about palliative care, we found that many participants immediately discussed their perceptions and assumptions about palliative care and other treatment options. Second, our study involved a small number of hospitals and was conducted in only one state. These factors may limit the generalizability of our results concerning perceptions and utilization of palliative care in acute care hospitals. However, despite the limitation of our sample, by interviewing nonphysicians in addition to physicians, we obtained more nuanced information about clinical decision making. Indeed, we found that physicians often had little insight into their own behavior but that nurses and case managers, who have the opportunity to observe multiple physicians taking care of similar patients, were able to detect and describe variations in physician behavior and attitudes. Expanding our study to a larger and more diverse sample is warranted, because insights into individual-level and hospital-level factors associated with variations in the utilization of palliative care services may help eliminate the barriers to receiving these services.\nUnlike most previous studies of palliative care, our study was a qualitative study in which we conducted in-depth interviews with a large number of physicians and nonphysicians. While many of our findings are new, some of them are consistent with findings of earlier studies. Palliative care may be gaining an increasing foothold in medical practice, but there continue to be problems in the way that it is perceived by health care professionals and patients. 8,33,34 Views that palliative care is synonymous with hospice care have been shown to fuel the perception that palliative care has little place in acute inpatient medicine. [35][36][37] Although nurses in acute care settings have been shown to be more accepting of a multidisciplinary team approach, 38 many studies note the need for further staff education and training, particularly regarding the dimensions of palliative care and the identification of patients who could benefit from this care. [39][40][41][42] Of particular importance are doctors' views on palliative care, which are likely to be especially influential in shaping an individual patient's care course. 33,43,44 For example, the belief that the decision to limit life-sustaining treatment is primarily physician-driven was confirmed in a recent study of 15 university-associated ICUs. 45 Although all physicians should have basic palliative skills, not all will be able to treat patients in complex cases. The idea that all physicians are inherently capable of delivering palliative care services perhaps stems from the perception that these services refer primarily or even exclusively to symptom management. 39 This particular aspect of palliative care is something that physicians start learning the first day of internship, but it is seldom taught in a systematic manner and seldom covers special problems of symptom management that emerge in specific hospital settings. 33,35,46 For example, in the ICU setting, 38,40 problems of particular concern include performing pain-provoking procedures, 47 having greater difficulty in assessing pain and discomfort, 47 and encountering higher levels of stress in patients' families. 48,49 A number of patients will require specialist palliative care from an experienced interdisciplinary team whose core activity is dealing with more complex problems, and access to specialist advice or care should be widely available. In our study, hospital staff suggestions for increasing integration and utilization of palliative care included providing training. Educational efforts must address issues concerning how to communicate effectively with patients and their family members, 50 how to involve patients in decision making early in the course of their illness, 51 and how to ensure that the advance care planning goals of patients are met. 52 An in-house education program for hospital staff about available palliative care services and how staff can work with consultative teams to provide these services to patients with life-limiting illnesses may help to achieve such ends. Further, by acting as an advisor to the patient's primary medical provider and staff, the palliative care consultant or team can promote seamless integration among institutions, settings, and services via use of the full array of interinstitutional and community resources (e.g., hospital, home care, hospice, long-term care, and adult day care services).\nMany factors are known to influence treatment decisions, including type of disease, prognosis, intensity of treatment, potential adverse effects, goals, and personal beliefs. The ineffectiveness of prior efforts to change practice patterns may also influence perceptions and utilization of palliative care services. 53,54 Although there were differences in the maturity of palliative care programs in the hospitals we visited, we did not find much variation in the themes and problems that participants discussed concerning the need for and utilization of palliative care services. Therefore, the development and testing of standardized strategies to eliminate barriers to palliative care services may be promising. In acute care settings, we found that moving consultation earlier in the hospitalization of a \"dying\" patient was a greater preoccupation than increasing palliative service use earlier in the illness trajectory. Any move short of far upstream will require that palliative care specialists market their benefits to patients and health care providers in ways that emphasize their unique skill set and compatibility with parallel treatment plans and do not threaten the autonomy of referring providers.", "n_publication_ref": 30, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PERCEPTIONS OF PALLIATIVE CARE 109", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Do hospital-based palliative teams improve care for patients or families at the end of life?", "journal": "Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2002", "authors": "I J Higginson; I Finlay; D M Goodwin; A M Cook; K Hood; A G Edwards; H R Douglas; C E Norman"}, {"title": "Is there evidence that palliative care teams alter end-oflife experiences of patients and their caregivers?", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2003", "authors": "I J Higginson; I G Finlay; D M Goodwin; K Hood; A G Edwards; A Cook; H R Douglas; C E Normand"}, {"title": "It had been on my mind before, but I did not know how to start talking about death", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2003", "authors": "M W Rabow; K Schanche; J Petersen; S L Dibble; S J Mcphee"}, {"title": "Assessing the effectiveness of a hospital palliative care team", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "1995", "authors": "J E Ellershaw; S J Peat; L C Boys"}, {"title": "Place of death: U.S. trends since 1980", "journal": "Health Aff (Millwood)", "year": "2004", "authors": "J Flory; Y X Yinong; I Gurol; N Levinsky; A Ash; E Emanuel"}, {"title": "Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care: \u0357www.dartmouthatlas.org\u0358 Accessed", "journal": "", "year": "2006-06-09", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Hospital based palliative care teams improve the insight of cancer patients into their disease", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "2004", "authors": "B Jack; V Hillier; A Williams; J Oldham"}, {"title": "Differences in Medicare expenditures during the last 3 years of life", "journal": "J Gen Intern Med", "year": "2004", "authors": "L R Shugarman; D E Campbell; C E Bird; J Gabel; T Louis; J Lynn"}, {"title": "The impact of a regional palliative care program on the cost of palliative care delivery", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2000", "authors": "E Bruera; C M Neumann; B Gagnon; C Brenneis; H Quan; J Hanson"}, {"title": "Benefits of Palliative Expertise", "journal": "", "year": "2002", "authors": " Mt;  Sinai"}, {"title": "A high volume specialist palliative care unit and team may reduce in-hospital end of life care cost", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2003", "authors": "T J Smith; P Coyne; B Cassel; L Penberthy; A Hopson; M A Hager"}, {"title": "The growth of palliative care programs in United States hospitals", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2005", "authors": "R S Morrison; C Maroney-Galin; P D Kralovec; D E Meier"}, {"title": "", "journal": "Task Force on Palliative Care; Last Acts Campaign", "year": "", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Foundation: Precepts of palliative care", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "1998", "authors": "Robert Wood ; Johnson "}, {"title": "Differences in understanding of specialist palliative care amongst service providers and commissioners in South London", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "2002", "authors": "S Payne; F Sheldon; N Jarrett; S Large; P Smith; C L Davis; P Turner; S George"}, {"title": "Simultaneous Care: Disease treatment and palliative care throughout illness", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2003", "authors": "F J Meyers; J Linder"}, {"title": "Palliative care: The World Health Organization's global perspective", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2002", "authors": "C M Sepulveda; A Yoshida; T Ullrich"}, {"title": "Illness trajectories and palliative care", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "2005", "authors": "S Murray; M Kendall; K Boyd; A Sheikh"}, {"title": "Patterns of dying: palliative care for nonmalignant disease", "journal": "Clin Med", "year": "2004", "authors": "F Murtagh; M Preston; I Higginson"}, {"title": "SUPPORT investigators: The symptom burden of seriously ill hospitalized patients.

However, most patients with cancer die without access to palliative care services (APCS), and patterns of referral are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of patients' access to palliative care. Patients and Methods: We reviewed patient records from the computerized database at UT M. D. Anderson Cancer Center over 2 (2003 and 2004) to determine differences in characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without APCS. APCS was defined as a palliative care consultation and follow-up or transfer to the palliative care unit. Results: A total of 499 of 1453 (34%) inpatients who died at our cancer center had APCS. There were no significant differences in race, age, or insurance status between the APCS groups. The two major predictors of a low rate of APCS were hematologic malignancies (20% rate of APCS versus 44% for solid tumors, p \u03fd 0.0001) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (15% versus 52% for non-ICU admission, p \u03fd 0.0001). Patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted to the ICU had the lowest APCS rate (10%, p \u03fd 0.0001).

[1][2][3] In 2005, approximately 570,000 patients died of cancer. 4 Because of the availability of anticancer treatments and higher patient expectations, patients with cancer seek life-prolonging measures with growing regularity. 5 As patients live longer, the need for supportive and/or palliative care increases. In recent years, palliative care has become recognized as a major com-ponent of cancer care in the United States, 6,7 but despite the rapid growth in palliative care services, the majority of general hospitals and cancer centers still do not have these services. 8 Even when palliative care services are present, many patients with cancer die without access to palliative care services (APCS), and the pattern of referral is not well understood. We have shown previously that approximately 35% of patients who died at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the fiscal years 2003 and 2004, were seen by our palliative care service. 9 We are not sure why the remaining 65% of the hospital decedents did not have APCS.

D. Anderson Cancer Center to identify all in-hospital deaths during 2 fiscal years (2003 and 2004). Our Institutional Review Board approved the study.\nM. D. Anderson Cancer Center is a 500-bed tertiary-care hospital. In 1999, a palliative care program was established at the institution. Methods were used to build referrals include extensive education sessions as well as direct communication with the primary oncologists about the program. In January 2002, an inpatient Palliative Care Unit (PCU) was established. Referrals to the PCU came primarily through transfers from other oncology inpatient services through the mobile consultation team, with fewer referrals coming via admissions from our palliative care ambulatory clinic and the Emergency Center.\nAt M. D. Anderson, patients are seen by a palliative care physician in the mobile consultation team or the ambulatory treatment center, upon request by the treating oncologist, to help with symptom management and/or to facilitate disposition to hospice care. Patients with severe symptoms or with significant psychological or family distress who require an interdisciplinary team approach are transferred to the PCU under the primary care of one of the palliative care physicians. The interdisciplinary team consists of a physician, fellows, an advance practice nurse (APN), a counselor, a chaplain, a social worker, physical and occupational therapists, and a pharmacist. The majority of the PCU patients (52%) are discharged to hospice after their symptoms are controlled. 10 The program maintains an ongoing contact with local hospices in the community through different activities that include monthly bus rounds. 11,12 Patients (or their insurance companies) are billed for all services provided in the cancer center. At the time of transfer to the PCU, the billing code is changed from that of primary oncology services to palliative care services. We determined APCS prior to death by merging the files of patients who died in the hospital with the billing files of patients seen by the palliative care service. APCS was defined as either being under the primary care of one of the palliative care attending physicians at the time of death or being under the primary care of an oncologist and being seen by the palliative care consultation team before death.\nWe collected the following information: demographic data, tumor type, and place of residence and compared it according to the patients' APCS. Primary tumors were further divided into hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome) and solid tumors. We calculated median length of stay (MLOS) for all patients.\nWe determined which patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at any time during admission by merging the files of patients who died in the hospital with the specific code for ICU admission.\nWe collected and compared the type of health insurance and the median cost of care per patient between patients who had APCS and those who did not for the final admission before death.

We were not able to determine whether patients with APCS achieved better control of physical and emotional distress; however, there is ev-idence that APCS results in improved symptom control. 10,13 In addition, critically ill patients with cancer in the ICU frequently express high levels of physical and emotional distress that can be alleviated by specialized palliative care team intervention. 14 Patients with hematologic malignancies tend to have lower rates of access to palliative care services compared to solid tumors. 15 Studies of patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU reveal an in-hospital mortality rate approaching 65% for patients who required ventilatory support. 16 Even if such patients survive to hospital discharge, their overall survival is very limited. The cost per year of life gained is higher for patients with hematologic malignancies than for those with solid tumors. However, recent advances in the management of complications and improved survival of patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU might have played a role in the low APCS rate in this subset of patients. [17][18][19][20][21] Despite the fact that these interventions have significant physical and psychosocial effects on patients and caregivers, [22][23][24] it has been recognized in the literature that palliative care is not offered to these patients and their families. 25,26 Maddocks et al. 14 compared the final month of life of patients with colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or acute leukemia and found that fewer patients with hematologic malignancies were referred to palliative care and that more died in the acute care setting.

In contrast, 75% of the patients with colorectal cancer and 61% of the patients with lymphoma were referred to a palliative care team. The symptom distress levels of all the patients were similar in Maddocks' study, arguing against a previous proposal that patients with hematological malignancies are not referred to palliative care because they have a lower symptom burden. 27 In view of the recent advances in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and their complications, as well as the improvement in the ICU mortality rate of these patients, a model that integrates palliative care along with standardized and investigational treatment might facilitate earlier access to palliative care. Such models have been studied by Meyers et al. 28 and have found acceptance in cancer research settings.\nWe found no significant difference in APCS associated with the demographic variables age, race, and insurance status. This is in contrast to the previous finding that patients with black ethnicity have a higher chance of dying in an acute care facility. 29 Our findings also do not agree with a study in patients with breast cancer that suggested that age is a strong predictor of APCS, with older women with breast cancer having the highest APCS compared to middle-aged and younger women. 30 In a study done in Australia to determine the extent of coverage of patients with cancer by designated community palliative care services, there was no difference in coverage related to gender, socioeconomic status, residential area, or race. We, however, found that a higher percentage of Texas residents had APCS than did not.\nIn a systematic review of the literature regarding problems and issues in accessing specialist palliative care, Ahmed et al. 31 found evidence of a lack of education about palliative care among health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, and social workers, as well as among patients and caregivers. In that systematic review, patients who belonged to a minority group or who were older had lower rates of access to palliative care. The authors concluded that there is a need for more knowledge about palliative care among all these groups and that standardized criteria for referral to palliative care services should be developed.\nIn our previous study of the impact of palliative care services, we found a significant reduction in deaths in the ICU after the palliative care unit was established. 9 In the current study, patients who were referred for palliative care had lower rates of admission to the ICU. While a causative relationship cannot be inferred from these findings, one explanation could be that palliative care services were helpful in providing an alternative place of death for critically ill, symptomatic patients who would have otherwise died in the ICU. However, an alternative explanation is that palliative care services were consulted because these patients were considered not appropriate ICU admission candidates. The SUPPORT study found no change in the percentage of ICU deaths following an educational intervention. 32 Our preliminary data after the opening of the palliative care unit 9 and our current results suggest that palliative care referrals may have impact in reducing ICU deaths. Further research is needed to clarify this point.\nThe overall cost for patients who accessed palliative care was lower. Patients who accessed palliative care and subsequently died in the palliative care unit continued to receive appropriate medical care, including intravenous hydration, intravenous antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and blood product transfusions, in addition to the symptom management and counseling of patients and their families. 10 This speaks to the feasibility of a model of an acute PCU where all appropriate interventions are offered to patients.\nOur study has some limitations. Because of the retrospective data collection, we were not able to assess the impact of palliative care services on the physical and psychological distress of patients and families. Therefore, we are not able to conclude that increased involvement of the palliative care team resulted in improved symptom control and/or quality of life in patients and families. This study was conducted in a major referral center and it is not clear if these findings can be generalized to other populations such as community-based practices.\nOur database does not allow us to clearly differentiate between patients admitted to surgical compared to medical services. However, because of the patterns of referral between services in our cancer center the vast majority of patients die under medical services. We are also unable to clearly determine how many of the hematological patients died on bone marrow as compared to hematologic or lymphoma services. However, most patients with hematologic malignancies in our institution die under the care of the primary leukemia or lymphoma services. Also, it is not clear how many of the patients studied were candidates for palliative care service referral. More research is needed, preferably in a prospective setting, to clarify this point.

These findings are compared to those from earlier studies in terms of PPS survival profiles and covariates. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the admission PPS scores of 733 palliative care patients admitted between March 3, 2000 and August 9, 2002 were examined for survival patterns. Other predictors for survival included were age, gender, and diagnosis. Results: Study findings revealed that admission PPS score was a strong predictor of survival in patients already identified as palliative, along with gender and age, but diagnosis was not significantly related to survival. We also found that scores of PPS 10% through PPS 50% led to distinct survival curves, and male patients had consistently lower survival rates than females regardless of PPS score.Our findings differ somewhat from earlier studies that suggested the presence of three distinct PPS survival profiles or bands, with diagnosis and noncancer as significant covariates.

A study by Kirk et al. 1 on \"what cancer patients and their families receiving palliative care want to be told\" has found prognosis and hope as most important in patient and family communication. Having accurate and timely prognostic information becomes the basis for one's transition from curative treatments to considering appropriate supportive care and likely decline to death. This remains a clinical challenge with wide variability seen in patient diagnoses, stages, degrees of symptom distress and pursuit of treatments. Furthermore, current literature suggests clinicians are not accurate in prognostication when estimating survival times of terminally ill patients. 2 To illustrate, Christakis and Lamont 3 conducted a prospective cohort study in five Chicago outpatient hospice programs to compare survival estimates of 343 clinicians against actual survival of 468 terminally ill patients. They found that overall, clinicians overestimated survival by a factor of 5.3; the inaccuracy was not restricted to particular types of clinicians or patients.\nThe 2001 systematic review by Chow et al. 4 showed that the use of prognostic tools can improve the accuracy of clinician survival prediction estimates. The review identified several prognostic indicators, with performance status most strongly correlated to survival duration. This was followed by the \"terminal syndrome\" with such factors as anorexia, weight loss, and dysphagia. One reported prognostic tool that measures the functional status of palliative care patients is the Palliative Performance Scale i (PPS). The PPS, adapted from the Karnofsky Performance Scale's functional dimensions of ambulation, activity level and evidence of disease, 5 and adds self-care, oral intake, and level of consciousness. PPS is divided into 11 categories from 0% to 100% in 10% increments. A patient with PPS 0% is dead; with PPS 100% is mobile and healthy. Since it was first published by Anderson et al. 6 in 1996 as a tool for measuring changing functional status in palliative care patients, PPS has been adopted and used in a variety of healthcare settings in different countries.\nDespite its extensive clinical use, a 2005 MED-LINE search found only four journal articles on the use of PPS for survival prediction. One study 7 involved patients with cancer in a palliative care unit (PCU), while the other three included heterogeneous populations from inpatient hospices 8 and community-based hospice programs. 9,10 Even though all four studies confirmed that PPS is a strong predictor of survival duration in those already identified as hospice or palliative care patients, there are important differences in the findings that require further investigation. For instance, in their 1999 study of terminally ill patients with cancer, Morita et al. 7 reported the presence of three distinct PPS profiles or bands at PPS 10%-20%, PPS 30%-50%, and PPS 60% or more, respectively. In contrast, the 2001 study by Virik and Glare 8 revealed no such distinct groupings. Whereas in the two 2005 studies, Harrold et al. 9 computed mortality rates using three equal divisions of PPS scores at PPS 10%-20%, PPS 30%-40%, and PPS 50% or more, and Head et al. 10 grouped PPS 10%-20% and PPS 60%-70% because of insufficient sample size.\nIn this paper, we describe the findings of a retrospective cohort study examining PPS as a prognostication tool for palliative care patients admitted to the Victoria Hospice Society (VHS) Palliative Care Unit in British Columbia, Canada. Our results are compared to those published in the literature in terms of PPS survival profiles and other variables associated with PPS in predicting survival times. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings and suggest next steps to further validate PPS as a prognostication tool for terminally ill palliative care patients.

Gender and age (but not primary diagnosis) were found to be significant predictor variables as well; no clinically significant interaction effects among these variables were noted from Cox regression analysis. These findings are different from those of Harrold et al. 8 that report an interaction between PPS and cancer/noncancer diagnosis in a Cox model for survival time. Their cohort consisted of 214 patients with and 252 patients without cancer. However, because our data included only 11.7% patients without versus 54% patients with cancer by Harold et al., this likely limits the ability to detect any difference as a result of our smaller sample proportion.\nComparing differences between PPS 10% and PPS 20%, Figure 1  difference from PPS 10% with clinically significant differences in mortality rates at 7 days and 30 days. That is, some patients at a very low functional level and apparently imminently dying do survive longer than others. Which specific diseases, cancer types or complications contributed to these differences warrant further investigation and clinical understanding.\nOur cohort had median survival times of 1 day at PPS 10% (CI 1,1), 2 days at PPS 20% (CI 2,2), increasing to 9 days at PPS 30% (CI 7,11), then to 17, 27, and 40 days at scores of PPS 40%, PPS 50%, and PPS 60%, respectively. Based on the mortality rates computed from this cohort, it can be expected that approximately 50% of patients with PPS 10% would not survive past 1 day upon admission, approximately 90% would not survive beyond the fourth day, and 99% would not survive by the seventh day; patients with PPS 30% would have greater than 50% chance of survival for 7 days or longer. Although the data demonstrate that male patients have shorter survival times than females given the same initial PPS score (mean 23 versus 31 days), the clinical relevance of this difference is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to clinically differentiate gender-specific survival times.\nWhile these findings support earlier studies that PPS is indeed a strong predictor of survival in terminally ill palliative care patients, there are also differences across these studies that warrant further investigation. In particular, our study showed that scores of PPS 10%, PPS 20%, PPS 30%, and PPS 40% display distinct hazard ratios and survival curves. This is in contrast to published reports by Morita, 7 Harrold 9 and Head 10 each reporting various groupings of PPS scores into bands or profiles. For example, in their analysis, Harrold et al. 9 used three bands at PPS 10%-20%, PPS 30%-40%, and PPS 50%-70%. Similar to ours, however, the 2002 study by Virik and Glare 8 consisting of 135 patients found distinct PPS survival curves with no evidence of grouping into bands.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "PPS IN EOL PROGNOSTICATION 1071", "text": "There are several possible reasons and limitations that may explain the differences observed across these studies. First, the patient cohort characteristics may differ because of disease stage, symptom crises, or complications and age. For instance, Virik and Glare 8 compared the overall median survival times of their patients with those from Morita et al. 7 (13 versus 27 days) and concluded that their patients were likely closer to the terminal stage of their illness. A second reason for discrepancies may relate to the location of care or the type of the PCUs. For example, the VHS PCU combines tertiary and residential patients. Tertiary admissions are usually for symptom crises or complex issues and may not be easily compared to other palliative settings. Although VHS also has a large palliative home clientele with many home deaths, only PCU deaths were included in this study. It is unclear whether survival patterns would be different across various locations. A third related limitation for PPS in survival estimation is that this study neither proves nor disproves the utility of PPS as a general predictor of patient prognosis since patients identified as palliative or hospice are a subset of the general population. Fourth, although not implied in these studies, misinterpretation of how to use the PPS tool can occur because it is a clinician's judgment for each level using relatively broad criteria. Because PPS was originally published, this issue has occasionally arisen, prompting clarification and minor refinement by VHS. Although no different in content and structure from the original PPS, PPSv2 is now the official version used at the Victoria Hospice. PPSv2 includes slight wording clarifications and definitions of terms not in the original version.

It has clinical utility as an easy-to-use communication tool. Despite its widespread use, the validity and predictive accuracy of PPS as a prognostication tool is not well understood. The four studies published to date have shown PPS to be a good predictor of survival in palliative patients with cancer but varying results in terms of the presence of distinct survival profiles, the influence of other predictor variables, and its applicability to heterogeneous hospice populations beyond patients with cancer. A larger analysis using 10 years of patient data, including information on disease, age, setting of care, and rate of change in PPS, is underway and may provide further insight and clarity.

Begin at the left column and read downwards until the appropriate ambulation level is reached, then read across to the next column and downwards again until the activity/evidence of disease is located. These steps are repeated until all five columns are covered before assigning the actual PPS for that patient. In this way, 'leftward' columns (columns to the left of any specific column) are 'stronger' determinants and generally take precedence over others.\nExample 1: A patient who spends the majority of the day sitting or lying down due to fatigue from advanced disease and requires considerable assistance to walk even for short distances but who is otherwise fully conscious level with good intake would be scored at PPS 50%.\nExample 2: A patient who has become paralyzed and quadriplegic requiring total care would be PPS 30%.\nAlthough this patient may be placed in a wheelchair (and perhaps seem initially to be at 50%), the score is 30% because he or she would be otherwise totally bed bound due to the disease or complication if it were not for caregivers providing total care including lift/transfer. The patient may have normal intake and full conscious level.\nExample 3: However, if the patient in example 2 was paraplegic and bed bound but still able to do some selfcare such as feed themselves, then the PPS would be higher at 40 or 50% since he or she is not 'total care.'\n3. PPS scores are in 10% increments only. Sometimes, there are several columns easily placed at one level but one or two which seem better at a higher or lower level. One then needs to make a 'best fit' decision. Choosing a 'half-fit' value of PPS 45%, for example, is not correct. The combination of clinical judgment and 'leftward precedence' is used to determine whether 40% or 50% is the more accurate score for that patient.\n4. PPS may be used for several purposes. First, it is an excellent communication tool for quickly describing a patient's current functional level.

[6][7][8] Researchers' attention has focused on the concepts of \"spiritual pain,\" 6,7 \"existential pain,\" 9 \"spiritual distress,\" 10 and \"spiritual prob-lem,\" 11 and the role of these experiences in a patient's overall sense of well-being. Recent studies have shown that spiritual struggles are connected with psychological distress in patients with cancer 12 and healthy individuals. 13,14 Research has found that participants with spiritual struggles tend to have poor physical outcomes and higher rates of mortality. 15,16 There is a large body of empirical evidence sug-gesting the importance of patients' existential experiences, not only in how they manifest in the disease process but also in how they inform patients' lives in general. 17 Moreover, theoretical analyses of patients' suffering have recently raised the issue of healthcare professionals' need to understand the complexity of their suffering. 18 Patients with pain present with a variety of other symptoms including nonphysical symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. 19 Part of the problem in understanding the complexity of patients' suffering arises from the fact that spiritual pain often manifests itself in physical and psychological symptoms 20,21 , and there generally is little understanding about the link between such symptoms and underlying spiritual issues. Thus, these issues are often treated as medical or emotional problems. Indeed, with little knowledge or experience in recognizing that emotional or physical symptoms have spiritual roots, treatment protocols do not have provisions to connect unresolved grief, chronic anxiety, or demoralization 22 with unresolved spiritual issues. 21 The current paper, as a systematic study of the phenomenon of spiritual pain, hopes to contribute to the overall body of knowledge that informs the medical treatment of patients with end-stage cancer specifically and of ailing people in general.\nWith the advent of modern medicine, spirituality, especially in the West, has developed as a distinct field, usually embedded in a religious or spiritual practice, with its own specially trained professionals to address issues of spiritual distress. As such, spiritual pain has become viewed as a subjective form of pain, whereas physical pain has been looked at through the objective dictates of anatomic facts arrived at through the scientific method of inquiry. The fully embodied experience of pain 23 has been overshadowed by a dichotomized medical-model approach that distinguishes objective physical pain from subjective personal suffering.\nThis compartmentalization of the human experience of pain began to change with the landmark papers of Melzack and Wall. 24,25 Their work expanded the conceptualization of pain from a purely sensory phenomenon to a multidimensional construct that integrates motivationalaffective and cognitive-evaluative components with sensory-physiologic ones. Their work began a shift in how physical pain was viewed. At present, the International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage and described in terms of such damage.\" 26 However, many people report pain in the absence of tissue damage or any likely pathophysiologic cause, suggesting that such pain may have psychological roots. Using the subjective report method, there is no way to distinguish the psychological experience of pain from that due to tissue damage since this method avoids tying pain to an underlying stimulus. 26 The objective measurement of pain through diagnostic imaging of neurophysiologic response also has limitations since it fails to assess pain intensity. 27 However, most researchers and clinicians now believe that since pain is a subjective experience, the patient's self-report provides the most valid measure of pain. 27 Like physical pain, spiritual pain can be an illusive concept, but it can nonetheless be identified and quantified. Because diagnostic categories determine treatment protocols, accurate understanding of the underlying origin of physical symptoms is crucial. Thus, it becomes critically important to differentiate between psychiatric, medical, and spiritual disorders. 21 Adding spiritual pain to the diagnostic categories could contribute to our understanding of underlying symptoms. Clark and Kissane's 28 work on \"demoralization syndrome\" has highlighted the importance of differentiating psychiatric conditions, such as depression, from existential disorders associated with existential suffering (i.e., existential anxiety, guilt, despair), which may occur in the face of illness and death. Their important work emphasizes the very divergent treatment modalities required for different conditions.\nThe current study attempts to identify and measure spiritual pain, physical pain, and depression with an aim towards differentiating between these conditions in 57 advanced cancer patients in a palliative care hospital setting.

Overall, 48% of patients framed their spiritual pain in intra-psychic terms (e.g., suffering with despair, loss, regret, or anxiety), 38% of patients expressed their spiritual pain in relation to the divine (e.g., feeling abandoned by God, being without faith and/or a religious/spiritual community), and 13% described their spiritual pain in relation to the interpersonal dimension (e.g., feeling unwanted by family members, feeling disconnected from others).\nThe presence and intensity of spiritual pain did not vary by gender, age, religiosity or religious affiliation. However, there was a significant difference among religious groups with respect to how they experienced spiritual pain. Catholics were significantly less likely than individuals of other religious faiths to describe spiritual pain in terms of the divine, 2 (1) \u03ed 4.64, p \u03fd 0.05, even though they were significantly more religious than other participants, F(1,54) \u03ed 4.75, p \u03fd 0.05.

Religious affiliation, the nature of the spiritual struggle, and the intensity of spiritual pain were not related to a desire for religious intervention from a chaplain. Roughly 50% of patients indicated that they would like the chaplain to provide a sense of \"presence,\" listen to them, visit with them, or accompany them on their journey. Twenty-one percent of patients reported that they would like the chaplain to pray with them, 7% would like the chaplain to perform a ritual or sacrament, and 6% wanted to explore the nature of God.\nNeither the presence of spiritual pain, nor its intensity were significantly correlated with either physical pain or perceived seriousness of illness. Only 7% (n \u03ed 4) of participants reported experiencing any physical pain. The mean pain score for these patients was 6.3 (SD \u03ed 2.6). Of those who reported no physical pain, approximately 32% were on analgesic medications, 20% were on sedatives, and 56% were on both.\nFewer than 30% of the participants described their spiritual pain in physical terms, such a deep ache in their heart, an explosion in the body, or an all-over physical pain. Interestingly, there was no correlation between the description of spiritual pain in physical terms and self-reported ratings of physical pain. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between spiritual pain and morphine intake, r(57) \u03ed 0.31, p \u03fd 0.05.\nSelf-reported depression scores were significantly correlated with both the presence of spiritual pain, r(55) \u03ed 0.43, p \u03fd 0.001, and its intensity, r(55) \u03ed 0.50, p \u03fd 0.001.

No differences were found among religious groups with respect to the presence or intensity of spiritual pain, depression, or physical pain.

The table also provides percentages for the accompanying emotions participants experienced in association with a rupture in each category. Spiritual struggles in the intrapsychic domain were associated with the widest range of emotions, including despair or resignation (40%), isolation or abandonment (20%), regret (10%), and anxiety (10%). Spiritual struggles in the interpersonal domain were accompanied by feelings of isolation (71%) and regret (24%). Spiritual struggles with the divine tended to involve feelings of resignation and despair (32%), anxiety (28%) and isolation (8%).", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The large number of patients experiencing spiritual pain at the time of the interview (61%) and at some point during their lives (96%) highlights the need to understand and address the spiritual SPIRITUAL PAIN AMONG PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER pain of cancer patients. Since many factors contribute to the overall expression of pain, spiritual pain would ideally be considered as one of the factors involved in the overall expression of pain in cancer patients. Patients' descriptions of their spiritual pain fell into three main categories-intrapsychic, interpersonal, and divine-demonstrating the multidimensionality of spiritual pain. The universality of spiritual pain was also revealed in this study in that the intensity of spiritual pain did not vary with respect to age, gender, religious affiliation, or level of religious involvement. Given both the universality and the multi-faceted nature of spiritual pain, we propose that when patients report the experience of \"pain,\" more consideration be given to the complexity of the phenomenon and that spiritual pain be considered as a contributing factor.\nAlthough physical pain was not significantly correlated with spiritual pain in the current study, approximately a third of the participants described their spiritual pain in quasi-physical terms, such a \"deep ache in the heart,\" an \"explosion in the body,\" or an \"all-over physical pain.\" It is interesting to note that patients receiving morphine therapy for physical pain were more likely to report experiencing spiritual pain. It is possible that with the amelioration of physical pain one is able to more clearly distinguish between physical and spiritual pain. By alleviating patients' physical pain, clinicians may be given access to the underlying spiritual and existential issues that might have lain dormant under the immediacy of physiologic distress. Once the physical strata of pain has been relieved, patients may come more in contact with the emotional and spiritual suffering that is associated with detaching from life and loved ones.\nThe identification of self with the physical body can often initiate a sense of crisis or spiritual pain in the face of an embodied experience of loss and deterioration. Illustrating this point, one patient observed that his spiritual pain feels like \"everything is breaking down and I'm not here anymore.\" This sense of existential annihilation is a powerful realization that one is separating from life as one ebbs toward death. For others, the sense of spiritual pain is inextricably linked with the physical. For instance, one person indicated that he could not tell the difference between physical and spiritual pain. Other patients described their spiritual pain in bodily terms, \"like all the elements of my body are diminishing,\" \"a big lump in my stomach,\" and \"an ache all over my body.\" Another patient observed that his spiritual pain \"feels like a bullet hit my heart. I feel the pain in my head too.\"\nFor just over half of the patients in our sample, spiritual pain was both manifested and communicated through the emotional realm, as they described their pain in intrapsychic terms such as feeling \"despair,\" \"regret,\" or \"anxiety.\" The large proportion of patients who employed emotional language in exploring their spiritual pain may be due in part to the notion that individuals in our culture are typically more versed in psychological nosology than they are in language that describes intangible aspects of one's spirituality. A number of theorists and researchers have recognized the need to develop a language that adequately communicates and clarifies phenomena that are transcendent and beyond the sphere of the finite mind. 30,31 While there appears to be a significant overlap between depression and spiritual pain, the present study suggests that spiritual pain can be dif-MAKO ET AL. 1110 ferentiated from depression. This differentiation is critical since the treatment of depression is quite different from that of spiritual pain. Based on the work of Kissane and colleagues 22,28 addressing the treatment of \"demoralization,\" we doubt that it is possible to alleviate spiritual pain through psychopharmacologic treatment. Although medication often effectively addresses depressive symptomology, spiritual pain calls for a different approach. Many participants expressed their spiritual pain in terms of \"leaving family and home,\" \"not being able to return home,\" or feeling \"homeless\" as they reflect upon their lives. Connelly 32 describes the experience of homesickness as a yearning to feel at home in the world, and the process of spiritual healing as a transformative journey leading one home toward a sense of wholeness. In this context, spiritual pain may be viewed as a symptom calling one back home to a sense of authenticity and reconciliation with earlier personal pain and unmet needs. This was felt by an 83-year-old woman who revealed that her spiritual pain stemmed from an incident when she was 7 years old and the man she thought was her father crudely told her she was not his daughter. This feeling of being orphaned as a child reawakened yearnings for a sense of belonging amidst the spiritual pain of disconnection she may have been experiencing as she gradually separated from her \"home\" in life toward her impending death.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Interventions", "text": "As palliative care continues to expand beyond physical pain management, novel psychotherapeutic interventions have emerged to meet the growing spiritual and existential needs of the dying better. Bolstering patients' sense of dignity and meaning at the end of life are key aims for palliative care. Chochinov and colleagues 33,34 have explored the nature of dignity in end-of-life care, and have developed a dignity-conserving therapy that seeks to augment patients' self-worth and meaning through a narrative life review. Breitbart and colleagues 35,36 have explored the spiritual and existential dimensions of meaning in advanced stage cancer and end-of-life care. Their team has developed meaning-centered group 36 and individual (W. Breitbart and S. Poppito, unpublished data) psychotherapeutic interventions for advanced stage cancer patients to help bolster their sense of meaning and purpose in life as they face the uncertainty of illness. Such an approach is largely based on Frankl's [37][38][39] existential work, and seeks to enhance patients' spiritual well-being by teaching them ways to tap into sources of meaning in order to cope with the spiritual and existential pain of living in the face of death.\nWhile some patients requested prayer and other religious rituals, the most frequently requested intervention was to spend time with a health care professional who would listen to the patient's story. Patients asked that the chaplain \"stay with me as long as possible,\" and \"stop by every now and then and talk to me.\" However, few requested sacramental presence (7%), which would indicate that what is being sought is not so much religious intervention as human compassion. The issue of clinical presence, in the form of being there or being fully present for patients in need, has been explored by way of \"nursing presence,\" 40 \"caring presence,\" 41,42 and \"healing presence\" [43][44][45] in palliative care literature. Presence carries significant developmental, spiritual and existential meanings for patients as they face end of life issues. Buber 46 describes the transcendent nature of the mutual \"I-Thou\" encounter based on unity and wholeness. Touching on this need for a spiritual encounter, one patient requested that the chaplain \"be present the way Mary was at the cross of Jesus,\" implying the need to have someone stand by or witness the patient as they confront their ultimate suffering.

[1][2][3] Patients with serious advanced illness experience undertreatment of symptoms while they receive aggressive life-prolonging treatments that are both physically burdensome and costly. 4 By design of Medicare funding for the hospice benefit, these patients gain access to palliative care focused on alleviation of symptoms, support for caregivers/families, and preparation for end of life only after they have relinquished disease-modifying or curative treatment. Palliative care funding through Medicare is available only for the final 6 months of life. Yet many patients and families may face unmet clinical needs for a longer period of time than the hospice benefit allows. 4 To address these issues of quality and cost of care The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded 22 demonstration projects in 1999 through a national initiative, Promoting Excellence at End-of-Life Care. The initiative sought to support novel care delivery models that \"extend(ed) palliative care upstream in the course of illness, concurrent with ongoing life-extending care\" 2 (p. 311) with the aim of identifying successful models and approaches. Among the 22 projects was the PhoenixCare program, a demonstration program of palliative care and coordinated care/case management services designed specifically for seriously chronically ill individuals who were simultaneously receiving active disease treatment through managed care plans. The demonstration project was funded to Hospice of the Valley, Phoenix, Arizona, one of the largest community-based hospice providers in the country.\nThis paper provides the outcome evaluation of a randomized trial to assess the impact of the PhoenixCare program. From the perspective of outcome evaluation, randomized trials to evaluate community models of enhanced case management and palliative care for individuals are rare. Programs have been documented with case studies, 5,6 demonstration projects showing effects in treated groups in the absence of untreated comparison groups 7 or in nonequivalent control group designs.

Participants were home-residing, were diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and had a life expectancy of up to 2 years from time of enrollment (rather than the 6-month window of Medicare hospice). The goal of the PhoenixCare program was to expand the scope of patient care and to improve patient quality of life relative to a comparable group of managed care patients not receiving the additional PhoenixCare intervention services. PhoenixCare delivered home-based services focused on disease and symptom management, patient and caregiver education on disease management, and social and psychological support. 12 Registered nurse case managers delivered the primary PhoenixCare services and assumed a leadership role in coordinating PhoenixCare services with the patient's primary care physician, with any case managers provided by the patient's MCO, and with community agencies. Patients' health care was funded by Arizona's alternative to Medicaid, by Medicare \u03e9 Choice (Medicare Risk contracts), or by commercial health insurance plans.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Rationale", "text": "The rationale for the PhoenixCare approach to integration of palliative care with treatment delivery through MCOs was fivefold in nature. First, at the time of study design, Arizona had the greatest proportion of its health care delivered by MCOs. 12 Second, in 1998, the year before the grant initiative, the federal government initiated the managed care Medicare model (Medicare \u03e9 Choice) as an alternative to fee-for-service; the model rapidly proliferated. A substantial portion of chronically ill patients whom PhoenixCare aimed to reach were Medicare or Medicaid eligible. Third, most individuals with life-limiting illnesses reside at home rather than in care facilities. 11 Home-based palliative care for individuals AIKEN ET AL. 112 who were seriously ill but neither institutionalized nor imminently dying would reach the largest population needing palliation. Fourth, the ability to link a single effective program of palliative care to a multiplicity of MCOs was expected to yield efficiency in providing palliative care services while treatment continued. Fifth, it appeared that the MCOs would provide a natural referral stream of clients to the study. In summary, partnering with MCOs was expected to create the combination of treatment and palliation that might best serve a large population of patients with life-limiting illnesses who were still actively living. It was theorized that the Phoenix-Care intervention would lead to better physical and mental functioning, at less or no more cost to the health care system.

The remaining 48 patients had metastatic cancer; they were originally included but were eliminated because of structural changes in the institution housing the project.

For purposes of data collection by telephone interview, patients were required to have a telephone in the home, and to either speak English or have a translator present in the home.

The complete PhoenixCare intervention is described in Lockhart et al. 12 Registered nurse case managers, each with a caseload of 30-35 patients, provided service. A medical director, social worker, and pastoral counselor provided support to case managers, who coordinated \"care planning with PhoenixCare team members, primary care physician, health plan case manager (if there were one), patient/family, and community agencies.\" 12 (pp. 1003-1004). Three distinct care protocols addressed phases of service delivery: (1) admission and initial case management of medically unstable patients, (2) management of stable patients following stabilization, and (3) support of unstable patients experiencing an exacerbation episode. All three protocols provided disease and symptom management, educational services, and support services. At admission, the disease and symptom protocol included assessing current health status, identifying immediate symptom management needs, establishing communication with the MCO contact and attending physician, developing an emergency response plan and coordinating this plan with attending physician. Educational services included development of advance care plans, providing education to patient and family about the disease, about patient self-monitoring and self-management of disease. Support services included assessing psychological and spiritual needs, assisting with access to community resources that might provide custodial care, transportation, and help with finances. During periods of patient stability, the three classes of services continued as needed, with evaluation of compliance with medication regimes, assessment of new symptoms, reinforcement of educational activities including advance care planning, and ongoing monitoring of need for support services. During illness exacerbation episodes, the registered nurse case managers took an active role in assessing medical status and implementing a symptom control intervention, and in communicating with the attending physician and MCO contact concerning the exacerbation episode.

MCOs furnished utilization data on each participating patient for the duration of his/her enrollment in the study, as well as for the 6 months prior to enrollment (or all the time that the patient had been enrolled in the MCO up to 6 months prior to enrollment in the study). a We considered emergency department visits as stand-alone events and LOS in the hospital. For our enumeration of emergency department visits, we considered only those emergency department visits that did not result in an immediate hospitalization. Emergency department visits resulting in hospitalizations were not counted. In determining which emergency department visits to count, we established that if a patient's condition was so severe and medically compromised that a hospitalization was required subsequent to an emergency department treatment, then that patient could not have managed his/her own symptoms adequately with the PhoenixCare individualized treatment plan at home. We derived two emergency department counts: (1) number of emergency department visits in the 6 months prior to entry into PhoenixCare, to characterize normative emergency department use pattern by the patient, and (2) total number of emergency department visits during PhoenixCare enrollment. Multiple medical claims were possible for a single emergency department visit; we thus counted only one emergency department visit per 24-hour period. We had originally intended to characterize hospitalizations as discrete events, to compute the LOS for each hospitalization, and then to compute the cumulative LOS across hospitalizations over the same time period as for emergency department visits. Inadequately reported hospital claims data did not permit calculation of length of stay. In a notable number of instances, admission date/discharge date pairs could not be unambiguously established from streams of MCO claims data; such pairs are required for each hospitalization episode for computation of the LOS of that hospitalization. b Beyond this, an extensive line-by-line review of medical claims data by the PhoenixCare Medical Director and Project Director revealed that hospitalizations could not be sorted into those directly related to the PhoenixCare target diagnoses (CHF, COPD) versus those related to other ancillary conditions, because all hospitalizations were identified by the primary diagnosis regardless of the treatment provided.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analysis", "text": "We refer to the intake interview as time 0, the first 3-month follow-up interview as time 3, the next, as time 6, etc. All analyses of intervention outcomes examined effects as a function of experimental condition (PhoenixCare, control), diagnosis (CHF, COPD), and their interaction. In these analyses, we controlled for any pretest differences by including the corresponding time 0 score as a covariate.

This last stream of data supported the evaluation of program implementation, reported in Lockhart et al. 12 b We devoted extensive effort to rendering the streams of claims data from the MCOs amenable to computation of LOS. There was no consistent method for reporting of claims data across MCOs. In our attempt to capture admission/discharge pairs, we found some measurements so anomalous from the perspective of medical utilization that we ultimately judged that the claims data could not be used to compute LOS (e.g., pairs of admissions and discharges that were separated by a year and would have led to computation of 365-day hospitalizations.) time 3 for all cases with time 3 data and outcomes at time 6 for all participants with time 6 measures. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for analysis of continuous variables; logistic regression, for binary variables; and Poisson regression, 25 for counts of number of emergency department visits.\nGrowth curve modeling of functional status over time. We expected that changes in functional status, as measured on the SF-36\u2122, might accrue gradually over time, even beyond the first 6 months of the intervention. We thus applied growth curve modeling in the multilevel framework 26 to each of the eight scales of the SF-36\u2122 to test hypotheses concerning the impact of the PhoenixCare intervention and to characterize whether groups improved, remained level, or declined over time. For each SF-36\u2122 scale, we fit a linear trajectory to all available data from each individual. Each individual's trajectory was characterized by its intercept and slope. Intercepts and slopes then became dependent variables for analysis as a function of condition, diagnosis, and the condition by diagnosis interaction. The average intercept of the individuals in a particular group (e.g., patients with COPD in the Phoenix-Care group) measures the overall level of functioning of the group at one point in time. Differences in intercepts across groups represent differences in level of functioning. By moving the intercept across the time scale in a series of analyses, 27 we could detect the point in time, if any, at which differences in levels of functioning between groups emerged. The average slope in a group characterizes the overall trend (decline, stability, improvement) for physical and mental health over time. Differences in slopes across groups indicate that groups are changing differentially over time. Each trajectory began at the time 3 data point; trajectories continued through the full complement of data for each case. The Initial Interview point (time 0) was used as a covariate to control for any differences between groups in their intercepts at the outset of the intervention.\nTreatment effect size estimates. We report a standardized effect size estimate for each observed difference between the PhoenixCare and control conditions (i.e., the number of standard deviations of difference between the groups).

The literature on preparedness and mental health, however, is in its infancy. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to summarize the literature in order to stimulate discussion and research on preparedness. It is our view that preparedness for the death of a loved one is an important contributor to caregiver well-being and bereavement outcomes and that more work in this area is needed in order to improve the care provided to caregivers of seriously or terminally ill patients. We briefly review the literature on preparedness, present a theoretical model delineating the relationships between preparedness, caregiver-health care provider communication, and caregiver well-being, and provide suggestions for future research.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A PPROXIMATELY 70% of the 2.4 million deaths per year in the United States result from chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic lung diseases. 1 Because these disabling conditions often compromise the ability of individuals to function independently, deaths are typically preceded by a period of family caregiving. 2 Family and friends provide personal care (e.g., dressing, feeding, housework), medical care (e.g., administering medications, changing dressings), and assist with medical decision-making and the coordination of care. 3 Providing care is particularly demanding when patients are terminally ill. The stress involved can cause serious morbidity; as many as 50%-60% of caregivers of the terminally ill experience depressive symptoms. 4 The adverse health effects can persist after the death. For example, Zisook et al. 5 reported that 2 months after the loss, 20% of widows/widowers met criteria for major depression and 15% met criteria for depression 1 year after the death. Approximately 10% of widows/widowers suffer from complicated grief, a syndrome cluster that predicts considerable morbidity over and above depressive symptoms. 6 The morbidity associated with terminal caregiving and bereavement has generated interest in the description and characterization of factors that are associated with caregiver distress. Many variables (e.g., gender, ethnicity, relationship to the care recipient, social support, burden, etc.) can affect mental health and well-being. 7,8 Recent data indicate that whether or not a caregiver was prepared for the death of their loved may also be an important factor. Being unprepared for the death is associated with greater depression, anxiety, and complicated grief. [9][10][11][12] Although preparing caregivers for the death of their loved one is a key task for those health care providers who provide care to dying patients, this component of end-of-life care is often neglected. 13,14 For example, a national probability sample of 1578 decedents demonstrated that 23% of informants reported that the death was \"extremely\" unexpected. 15 In one community-based sample, 25% of bereaved caregivers thought that health care providers should have done more to prepare them. 14 This neglect reflects in part the lack of a research base on preparedness that clinicians can use to help guide the care they provide to caregivers.\nOur goal, then, is to stimulate research on preparedness in order to improve the care provided to caregivers of seriously or terminally ill patients. We will briefly review the current literature on preparedness, present a theoretical model delineating the relationships between preparedness, caregiver-health care provider communication, and caregiver well-being, and provide suggestions for future research.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PREPAREDNESS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Preparedness and clinical outcomes", "text": "It has long been suggested that family and friends who are forewarned or prepared for the death are better able to prepare psychologically. 16 Recent data have indeed confirmed that bereaved caregivers who perceived themselves as unprepared for the death are less satisfied and suffer from worse mental health. [9][10][11][12] For example, in a study of 112 spouses of deceased cancer patients, those who were not prepared had more depressive symptoms and more severe grief. 10 A study of 122 caregivers demonstrated that lack of preparedness for the death was associated with ma-jor depressive disorder and complicated grief 9 months after the death. 11 A study of caregivers of patients with dementia showed similar results. The 23% who perceived themselves as unprepared for the death had a twofold to threefold higher likelihood of depression and complicated grief than those who felt prepared. 12 In a study by Valdimarsdottir et al., 17 widows who were not informed of their husbands' impending deaths or were not provided with support from health care providers during the last month before the deaths were at increased risk of anxiety and tranquilizer use up to 5 years after the death. The relationship between preparedness and psychiatric morbidity was dose-dependent; the less prepared bereaved persons felt, the higher the risk of psychiatric complications.\nIndirect evidence for the impact of preparedness on clinical outcomes also comes from hospice data. Bradley and colleagues 18 conducted a prospective study of primary family caregivers of terminally ill adult patients. They demonstrated that caregivers of patients enrolled in hospice for fewer than 4 days were almost threefold more likely to suffer from depression 6 to 8 months after the death. Caregivers remained at elevated risk 13 months after the death. After adjusting for potential confounders, caregivers of patients enrolled in hospice for fewer than 4 days were almost nine times more likely to be depressed. 19 Christakis and Iwashyna 20 analyzed data from a matched retrospective cohort study from a large population-based sample of elderly couples. Surviving spouses of people who had enrolled in hospice had a lower mortality than those of decedents who did not enroll. 20 Both groups of investigators hypothesized that their results might be explained by the fact that hospice services, such as counseling and spiritual care, prepare the family for the patient's impending death.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Definition of preparedness", "text": "The duration and intensity of terminal care (e.g., spouses of hospice patients with lung cancer spend an average of more than 100 hours per week providing care) may mislead health care providers into believing that caregivers have ample time to prepare for the death. 4 This is often not the case. Preparedness, or the degree to which a caregiver is ready for the death, is not dependent on the duration or intensity of care. Rather, it is a caregiver's perception of his/her readiness", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PREPARING CAREGIVERS FOR THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE 1165", "text": "for the death. 11 It is important to note, however, that although preparing caregivers for the death of their loved one is an integral component of good end-of-life care, preparedness has never been fully defined or conceptualized. 21 This lack of precision or consensus about the term preparedness has important research and clinical implications-precise descriptions and definitions are central to the ability of investigators to study preparedness and of clinicians to intervene on behalf of caregivers. In addition, although there exists an important body of literature on topics related to preparedness (e.g., prognostication, death acceptance, anticipatory grief, etc.), preparedness is not synonymous with these constructs. 22,23 For example, being told a loved one's prognosis, although an important component of preparedness, may not be sufficient for caregivers to be cognitively and emotionally prepared for the death. Similarly, accepting that death is inevitable does not mean that one is prepared.\nTwo areas of research provide additional insight on preparedness. The first pertains to the concept of uncertainty in illness. Uncertainty, or the \"inability to determine the meaning of illness-related events\" exists when a situation is unpredictable, when information is inadequate, and when people feel insecure in their understanding. 24 These are the same conditions that contribute to caregivers being unprepared for the death. 25 Although some work demonstrates that uncertainty is sometimes desirable (e.g., when uncertainty is viewed as a challenge or an opportunity for growth), the majority of work on uncertainty in illness has shown that uncertain situations are a threat to well-being. 26 The most frequent finding is the positive relationship between uncertainty and emotional distress, anxiety, and depression across a variety of clinical populations. [27][28][29] The few studies that have been conducted among caregivers have shown similar relationships. For example, among spouses of patients with multiple sclerosis, uncertainty was among the strongest predictors of caregivers' health impairment. 30 Uncertainty has also been negatively associated with health in spousal caregivers of patients with advanced cancer and in caregivers of patients with Parkinson's disease. 31,32 ", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Multidimensional nature of preparedness", "text": "Although informative, work on uncertainty in illness does not fully elucidate the nature of pre-paredness. In particular, the bulk of work on uncertainty in medical settings has focused on medical uncertainty (i.e., issues surrounding diagnosis, prognosis, symptoms, treatment, and disease progression) in acutely ill patients. 33,34 While these issues are certainly pertinent to caregivers, preparedness is a multidimensional construct that may also center on nonmedical concerns such as the availability of financial resources, changes in future life plans, and existential issues.\nSteinhauser and colleagues 35 studied these issues by conducting focus groups and a national survey of patients, families, and health care providers in order to determine what factors are important at end of life. They demonstrated that preparedness, or the degree to which the caregiver was ready for the death, was multidimensional, with medical, psychosocial, spiritual, and practical dimensions. For example, preparedness involves (1) knowing what signs and symptoms to expect during the terminal phase (medical), (2) discussing grief and emotions and maintaining relationships with friends and family (psychosocial), (3) prayer and talking about the meaning of the death (spiritual), and (4) planning funeral arrangements (practical). A major implication of these findings is that preparedness likely means different things to different caregivers. For example, for some, being prepared for the death may mean having advance directives in place, estate planning completed, etc. For others, it may mean turning to God in a search for meaning. 36 ", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Determinants of preparedness", "text": "Given its multidimensional nature, several factors may affect how prepared caregivers are for the death. Among these are cultural beliefs and practices. For example, explanatory mechanisms about illness, religious beliefs and practices, and beliefs about death and dying may all impact preparedness. 37 Few studies, however, have specifically looked at potential predictors of preparedness. Hebert and colleagues 12 demonstrated that five variables-ethnicity, education, income, whether or not the patient was in pain or physical discomfort before the death, and prebereavement depression-were related to preparedness. As had been shown by others, the duration of caregiving was not associated with preparedness. 12 Blacks, caregivers with less education, those with less income, and those with more depressive symptoms were more likely to perceive HEBERT ET AL. 1166 themselves as \"not at all\" prepared for the death. The authors speculated that these results might be a result of less access to good palliative care. Ethnic minorities and individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience health disparities at end-of-life. 38,39 In contrast, the amount of pain the care recipient was in prior to death was positively associated with preparedness. Because family caregivers often view pain as an inevitable part of the dying process, it is possible that those caregivers who are providing care to a loved one who is in pain are better able to mentally prepare for the death. 40 ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "THEORETICAL MODEL", "text": "We have reason to believe that another factor deserves further study. Specifically, we believe that communication between caregivers and health care providers is a major predictor of preparedness. This assertion is based on a body of data demonstrating that (1) quality communication with health care providers is associated with improved psychological adjustment; (2) caregivers have identified communication about death with the health care providers caring for their loved one as one of the most important and neglected aspects of end-of-life care; and (3) good communication about death and dying with health care providers is necessary for caregivers to prepare for the death. [41][42][43][44] Although the vast majority of communication studies refer to patients, there is evidence that similar relationships between communication and clinical outcomes can be expected with caregivers. For example, studies show that when caregivers of seriously ill patients voice questions and perceive that their questions have been answered, satisfaction and quality of life are improved and there are fewer depressive symptoms. 45,46 We hypothesize that better communication about death and bereavement between caregivers and health care providers will improve caregivers' preparedness, and as a result, their clinical outcomes (Fig. 1). Two aspects of the model are important to note. First, although discussions about preparedness can be a primary focus of discussion (solid arrow), the multidimensional nature of preparedness (i.e., preparedness has medical, psychosocial, spiritual, and practical dimensions) indicates that discussions can also be", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "PREPARING CAREGIVERS FOR THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE 1167", "text": "FIG. 1.

Rather, they should be responsive to the individualized needs of caregivers and occur in stages so families can assimilate the information. 48 ", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Communication and preparedness", "text": "A frequent source of frustration for families is that health care providers never discussed the fact that their loved one was dying. Common complaints are that conversations do not occur or are couched with ambiguous language (e.g., \"the patient may not get better\"). 44 This deficit in communication is in large part responsible for caregivers being unprepared for the death and left with unanswered questions about death and dying, interpersonal and spiritual concerns, and what to expect in the future. 14,49,50 In contrast, family-centered palliative care, which includes open and frequent communication between the patient, family, and health care providers, allows families to more fully prepare for the death. 51 A study by Valdimarsdottir et al. 17 of widows whose husbands died of prostate cancer provides some insight into the relationship between communication and preparedness. Widows who reported an awareness time (the duration of time when the widow realized that her husband's disease was fatal to the time of death) of less than 24 hours reported the most anxiety. The investigators performed an exploratory analysis of potential predictors of short awareness time. They found that the duration of illness and the level of patient disability were not related to awareness time. Rather, communication about death, dying, and bereavement, and the provision of psychosocial support by the physicians caring for the patients had the strongest association with awareness time.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "There are several potentially fruitful avenues of research into the role of preparedness at endof-life. The first step is to properly conceptualize and measure preparedness. In the studies to date, caregivers were typically asked some variation of the question, \"How prepared were you for the death?\" This type of question is subject to interpretation; caregivers who perceive themselves as \"unprepared\" may be referring to issues such as lack of information, cognitive awareness, emotional adjustment, spirituality or other plans for adjusting to the impending death. Development of a reliable, valid, and multidimensional measure of preparedness is necessary before clinical interventions targeting preparedness can be properly developed and tested.\nSecond, a large body of conceptual and empirical work has evolved in recent years to provide clinicians with guidance on how to best communicate with patients and families. 47,52,53 What is missing from this literature, however, is empirical guidance on how clinicians can communicate with caregivers to prepare them for the death of their loved one. Although existing communication-based interventions and training programs can be effective in changing health care providers' attitudes, skills, and beliefs, and in improving recognition of patients' psychosocial concerns, future interventions will need to be tailored to the specific information needs of caregivers. 35,54,55 Preparedness-focused interventions will also need to account for the fact that caregivers' willingness to discuss death and dying often varies during the course of the illness. 56 In addition, providing information will not be enough. Good communication is dependent on more than simple information exchange. Consideration has to be given to timing, location, format, and the language used. The process of communication (i.e., how information is delivered, the attitudes of health care providers, etc.) is as important as the content and is critical to how the information is perceived. 48 One additional promising aspect of these interventions is their potential impact on caregivers' mental health, not only during terminal caregiving, but also after the death of the patient. Intervening with caregivers prior to the death rather than after is likely to be more beneficial for bereavement mental health, and potentially, could offset the mortality risks associated with caring for a terminally ill loved one. 57,58 For example, a study of 73 adult family caregivers showed that support provided prior to the patient's death accounted for 29% of the variance in bereavement distress while support after the death accounted for only 2%. 59 Currently, most bereavement interventions target caregivers months after the death. 60 ", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HEBERT ET AL. 1168", "text": "Third, the multidimensional nature of preparedness has several implications. Current work on preparedness has focused on the relationship between preparedness and mental health, primarily depression and grief. While these are important outcomes, better preparing caregivers for the death may also affect spiritual well-being. Spiritual well-being is itself an important determinant of quality of life for caregivers. 61 It would also be important to determine the relationship between preparedness and surrogate decisionmaking. Research suggests that many caregivers are unprepared for the death of their loved one and as a result, are uncomfortable in setting goals for their loved one's end-of-life care. 62 Finally, end-of-life care often involves interactions between caregivers and various professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers, mental health professionals, clergy, etc.). These professionals have distinct roles in preparing caregivers for the death. More research should be conducted to determine the impact of these different professionals on preparing caregivers for the death.\nFourth, existing research has been limited to bereaved caregivers (i.e., the bereaved were asked how prepared they were for the death). Although bereaved individuals can be accurate when recalling their level of grief, the retrospective nature of this design may introduce bias such that persons suffering from greater mental health morbidity may be more likely to perceive themselves as having been unprepared for the death. 63 Future studies should assess preparedness prior to the death, using a valid instrument, in order to determine how preparedness impacts morbidity.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SUMMARY", "text": "Florence Nightingale best summarized how being unprepared for the death can affect caregivers: Apprehension, uncertainty, waiting, expectation, fear of surprise, do a patient more harm than exertion.

Research now provides guidance to assist clinicians in: a) recognizing differences between complicated and uncomplicated bereavement reactions, b) identifying risk factors that may make certain individuals more vulnerable to bereavement-related complications, c) appreciating and monitoring for potential adverse outcomes associated with bereavement and d) taking actions to prevent or minimize maladjustment to the loss. In this article we distinguish between the course of normal grief and abnormally prolonged, or complicated grief; clarify distinctions between Complicated Grief Disorder and other mental disorders secondary to bereavement; review outcomes associated with Complicated Grief Disorder; describe research on resilience in bereavement; present findings on stigmatization and the use of mental health services among recently bereaved persons; and summarize where the field is with respect to establishing the efficacy and effectiveness of bereavement interventions. Promising new psychotherapies for Complicated Grief Disorder have shown clinical efficacy. Nevertheless, further research is needed to enhance the detection of vulnerable bereaved persons, to promote resilience following significant interpersonal loss, and to tailor interventions to address the attachment issues that lie at the heart of this disorder.B EREAVEMENT IS THE EXPERIENCE of losing to death a person to whom one is attached. Grief refers to the emotional distress associated with that loss. Nearly 2.5 million U.S. citizens died in 2003, and these deaths left in their wake multiple millions of survivors to grieve their loss. 1 U.S. Census data from 2003 indicate that approximately 75% of all deaths occurred in persons aged 65 years and older 1 ; nearly half of all women age 65 and older are widows. 2 U.S. Census data further reveal that approximately 6% of all deaths were from unnatural causes (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, 1.8%; firearms, 1.2%). Thus, despite all the media attention paid to traumatic deaths, U.S. Census data show that the vast majority of Americans die of natural causes in old age. Because deaths of friends and family members are common life experiences that become increasingly more frequent as a person ages, there may be a tendency on the part of clinicians to nor-", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "malize and potentially dismiss the distress and disruption evoked by bereavement. Nevertheless, research has demonstrated that the loss of a loved one is among life's most stressful experiences. 3,4 Despite being a common, normal, and natural part of life, bereavement and the grief it evokes are still associated with heightened risk for morbidity and mortality.  Research repeatedly has demonstrated that bereaved persons are at elevated risk for a variety of adverse negative physical, mental, and social outcomes.  It is important to note that the majority of bereaved individuals experience normal, uncomplicated grief reactions. 26 Consequently, the serious adverse outcomes associated with bereavement are concentrated in the significant minority of bereaved persons with complicated bereavement reactions. [5][6][7]9,12,15 For this reason there is a need for clinicians to understand better how to identify and treat persons with complicated adjustment to bereavement. The primary objective of this update on bereavement research is to provide information to guide clinicians in their evaluations of and interventions with bereaved individuals.\nMore specifically, in light of how common bereavement and grief are, and the negative impact bereavement may have on the survivor's health, there is a need for clinicians to be able to: (1) recognize differences between complicated and uncomplicated bereavement reactions, (2) identify possible risk factors that may make certain individuals more vulnerable to bereavement-related complications, and (3) take informed actions to prevent and intervene in order to minimize maladjustment to the loss. Below we distinguish between normal grief and complicated grief, distinguish Complicated Grief Disorder from other psychiatric disorders, review outcomes associated with Complicated Grief Disorder, describe research on resilience in bereavement, stigmatization, and the use of mental health services among recently bereaved persons, and review where the field is with respect to establishing the efficacy and effectiveness of bereavement interventions.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "NORMAL GRIEVING", "text": "Approximately 80%-90% of bereaved individuals experience normal or uncomplicated grief. 26 Although uncomplicated grief can be very painful and disruptive, most bereaved survivors overcome the initial sense of disbelief and gradually come to accept the loss as a reality. The vast majority of bereaved people are eventually able to move on with their lives and proceed with their daily functions and activities. Most people are able to adjust to loss over time in a more-or-less adaptive way.\nWhat does the normal, or average, resolution of grief look like? Over the years, the stage theory of grief resolution (see top of Fig. 1) described for dying patients by Kubler-Ross 27 and for adjustment to bereavement by Bowlby and Parkes, 28,29 has had enormous appeal among bereavement experts and laypersons. [27][28][29][30][31] Although the stage theory of grief resolution has never been tested explicitly, there has been wide acceptance of the notion that normal grief involves an orderly progression through the following stages: disbelief or shock; separation distress or yearning; angry protest; depressed mood or despair; and ultimate acceptance of or recovery from the loss. [29][30][31] The bottom of Figure 1 illustrates the average pattern of resolution of each of these five grief-stage indicators in a sample of bereaved community-based participants of the Yale Bereavement Study (n \u03ed 281).\nIn Figure 1, yearning, rather than disbelief, is the most frequently endorsed initial reaction, with yearning remaining the most elevated negative symptom of grief throughout the study observation period. It should be noted that shock and other immediate reactions to the death prior to 2 months predated our initial bereavement assessment and results pertain only to the 2 through 24 months postloss period, so it is possible that disbelief may have peaked prior to 2 months postloss. Disbelief, depressed mood, and yearning decline gradually over time from 2 to 24 months postloss. Interestingly, anger levels remain stably low throughout the observation period. Over time, acceptance of the loss increases and reveals a pattern inverse to changes in disbelief and yearning. These results suggest that bereavement-related distress generally diminishes, and acceptance of the death steadily increases, as time progresses from the loss.\nDuring the initial months after the loss, many of the signs and symptoms of normal grief are very similar to those of Complicated Grief Disorder, yet by 6 months postloss, most bereaved individuals are able to accept the reality that the person has died, see the future as holding some ", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "COMPLICATED GRIEF DISORDER", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Terminology", "text": "Before attempting to provide a description of Complicated Grief Disorder, it is important to clarify some potential sources of confusion. First, many different terms have been used to describe the same phenomenon. Complicated Grief Disorder has also been referred to as pathologic grief, abnormal grief, atypical grief, and pathologic mourning. We had used the term \"Traumatic Grief\" because we thought that captured the essence of the underlying forms of symptomatic distress, but after the 9-11 attacks, the need to distinguish a grief disorder from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder became apparent. As a result we reverted to our original term of \"Complicated Grief\" in an attempt to minimize confusion between this reaction to loss and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders.

Survivors who meet criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder feel bitter over the loss and wish desperately that their life could revert back to the time when they were together with their deceased loved one. Complicated Grief Disorder is characterized by an intense longing and yearning for the person who died. Without the deceased person, the bereaved survivor with Complicated Grief Disorder feels empty and has little hope that he or she will find fulfillment in the future. Recurrent, intrusive and distressing thoughts about the absence of the deceased make it difficult for persons with Complicated Grief Disorder to concentrate and to move beyond an acute state of mourning and live in the present. Such persons are often preoccupied by their sorrow and also ruminate about regrets concerning the loss. Their ruminations and inability to concentrate on things aside from their loss, and the sense of being disconnected from people with whom they formerly felt close prior to the death, exacerbates the sense of alienation and social isolation. People with Complicated Grief Disorder feel that life lacks meaning and purpose without the deceased and find it extremely difficult to adjust to their lives by forming other interpersonal relationships and engaging in potentially rewarding activities. For many, there is a sense that a part of themselves died along with their loved one and that the rest of their lives is destined to be empty, dissatisfying and spent missing the deceased. 26 It is no wonder that Complicated Grief Disorder, over and above confounding influences such as Major Depressive Disorder, has repeat-\nUPDATE ON BEREAVEMENT RESEARCH 1191 TABLE 1.

Other psychiatric disorders, such as Major Depression or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, may develop secondary to the loss of a significant other. For example, Zisook and Shuchter 34 reported that 24% of their widowed sample met criteria for depressive episodes and 10% met criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at 2 months postloss. Barry et al. 35 found that at 4 months postloss the rate of Major Depressive Disorder in the first 122 participants enrolled Yale Bereavement Study was 9%, the rate of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder was (5.7%), and the rate of Complicated Grief Disorder was 10.7%.\nStudies have also shown that Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms form a coherent cluster distinct from bereavement-related depressive and anxiety symptoms clusters. [6][7][8][9][10]14 Symptoms of sadness, impassivity, and psychomotor retardation are all depressive symptoms whereas symptoms of yearning for the deceased and trouble \"moving on\" without the deceased (separation distress), an inability to accept the death and the reality that the deceased is truly gone, feeling detached from significant others since the death, and feeling bitter and agitated about the death are all specific indicators of Complicated Grief Disorder. 8,10 Contrasting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Complicated Grief Disorder, we note that avoidance of fear-inducing stimuli associated with psychic trauma does not occur with Complicated Grief Disorder after a natural death. Rather, there is a hyperfocus on the loss and reminders of the deceased, a desire for reconnection with the deceased, and comfort felt, not aversive physiologic reactivity, when exposed to symbolic cues that conjure thoughts of the deceased. Generally speaking, fears of violent, especially physical, harm to self or significant others, and the hypervigilance triggered by a sense of impending attack, play a more significant role for trauma victims than they do for people with Complicated Grief Disorder 14,36 occurring in response to natural occurring deaths. Additionally, the unique separation distress symptoms of Complicated Grief Disorder such as longing and pining for the deceased, and interpersonal attachment issues of mistrust of others and difficulty forming new relationships and concerns about interpersonal abandonment are not included among criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. 36  Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, risk factors, course, outcomes and response to treatment associated with Complicated Grief Disorder set it apart from these other disorders. Given that many of these distinctions are mentioned in other sections of this review, a concise summary of these differences will be provided here. Risk factors unique to Complicated Grief Disorder include childhood abuse and serious neglect, 37 childhood separation anxiety, 38 kinship relationship to the deceased (parents, spouses and offspring the most adversely affected), 39,40 insecure attachment styles, marital closeness and support, 41 lack of preparation for the death, 35 and, in parental bereavement, the number of remaining children. 42 Essentially all but childhood abuse and neglect were risk factors that were not significantly associated with the onset of Major Depressive Disorder or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Wijngaards-de Meij 42 found, gender, religious affiliation and professional help-seeking were associated with bereavement-related depression but not grief. As will be described in the following sections, the course and response to treatment differ for Complicated Grief Disorder versus Major Depressive Disorder, 7,43,44 and the adverse outcomes associated with Complicated Grief Disorder are independent of depression and/or anxiety symptoms or disorders, indicating its unique contribution to the prediction of enduring morbidity, distress, and dysfunction.

For example, results of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of bereaved patients with Major Depressive Disorder found the tricyclic antidepressant nortiptyline alone had a 56% remission rate; nortriptyline in combination with interpersonal psychotherapy had a remission rate of 69%; and interpersonal psychotherapy alone, 29%. 43 As an important distinction, nortriptyline and/or interpersonal psychotherapy in this study did not result in significantly greater re-ductions in symptoms of complicated grief relative to placebo. 43 [A subsequent section reviews promising treatments that are being investigated for the symptoms of Complicated Grief Disorder, specifically.] An open-label trial of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, administered weekly over 4 months, demonstrated a 54% decline in symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. 46 These findings suggest that treatments of proven efficacy for the reduction of Major Depressive Disorder are likely to be effective in the treatment of bereavement-related depression.\nClinicians treating bereaved patients frequently ask about the DSM-IV exclusion of the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder before 2 months postloss, and whether treatment for depression should be initiated prior to diagnosis. Before that question can be answered, data are needed to determine whether short and/or longterm benefits accrue from initiating treatment for depression early (e.g., within the first 2 months) versus later in the course of bereavement.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "How soon postloss can a diagnosis of complicated grief disorder be made?", "text": "The criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder proposed for inclusion in the DSM-V specify that the particular symptomatic distress must persist for at least 6 months, regardless of when those 6 months occur in relation to the loss. 11,26,47 Hence, chronic and delayed subtypes of grief are both included in this conception of Complicated Grief Disorder, as long as the chronicity refers to, and the delay includes, at a minimum the required 6 months of symptomatic distress.

Requiring the symptomatic distress to last longer than 6 months minimizes Type 1 error and ensures a higher rate of true positive cases of Complicated Grief Disorder. Figure 2 displays the mean complicated grief resolution scores (a summation of the nine symptoms presented in Table 1) over time from loss for those with and without Complicated Grief Disorder diagnosed at 6 months postloss. In contrast with Figure 1, which illustrates a significant decline in mean grief scores from 2 to 24 months postloss, in Figure 2 we see that the mean grief score for subjects diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder remains persistently higher and never intersects the mean grief score for subjects not diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder from 2-50 months postloss. This indicates that it is unlikely: (1) that many of those diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder will resolve their grief and (2) that they will prove to be false-positives for a diagnosis of Complicated Grief Disorder assessed later in the course of bereavement. These results suggest that bereaved persons diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder at 6 months postloss are unlikely to resolve their grief naturally and may benefit from interventions aimed at reducing their chronically high levels of grief.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 3}, {"heading": "Outcomes of complicated grief disorder", "text": "While bereavement itself is associated with many negative health consequences (described earlier in this article), studies have found that Complicated Grief Disorder among the bereaved is associated with heightened risk of physical and mental impairments. In other words, among bereaved subjects, those with Complicated Grief Disorder have been identified as a subgroup at heightened risk of enduring distress and dysfunction. For example, Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms have been associated with an increased risk of cancer, hypertension, cardiac events, and suicidal ideation. [5][6][7][8][9][10]32,33 They have been associated with disability, functional impairments (social, family, and occupational dysfunction), adverse health behaviors such as alcohol and cigarette consumption, increased rates of hospitalization, and reduced quality of life.

[7][8][9][10]12,15 Table 2 summarizes the relative risks of some of the negative health outcomes associated with Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms from a study that specifically investigated the predictive validity of Complicated Grief Disorder symptomatology. 7 Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms have been shown to predict a wide variety of adverse outcomes in numerous independent investigations, but we present only those for a single study in Table 2 so that the magnitude of the effects can be compared and so that comparisons are not made across different predictors and outcomes assessed at variable times postloss. Table 2 reveals that bereaved individuals with Complicated Grief Disorder at 6 months are 1.11 times more likely to develop high blood pressure at 13 months, 2.72 times more likely to develop depression at 13 months, 16.7 times more likely to experience a change in their smoking habits, and 7.02 more likely to report change in their eating habits 13 months postloss. Table 2 further indicates that bereaved persons experiencing Complicated Grief Disorder at 6 months are more likely to have heart trouble (relative risk \u03ed 1.15), and alcohol consumption problems at 25 months postloss (relative risk \u03ed 1.25). 7 The adverse health behaviors and health consequences associated with Complicated Grief Disorder imply the need for health care professionals to attend to grief severity in bereaved family members. The first step in intervention requires the detection of those at risk. Below we review the literature on risk factors for Complicated Grief Disorder and show the ways in which they are similar and dissimilar to the risk factors for the onset of Major Depressive Disorder after a major interpersonal loss.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Risk factors for complicated grief disorder", "text": "Research has identified many factors that may predispose certain people to Complicated Grief Disorder and other difficulties adjusting to the death of a loved one. Relationships between the survivors and the deceased that were characterized as being dependent, close, and confiding have proven risks for poor bereavement adjustment, including an elevated risk for Complicated Grief Disorder. 41,[48][49][50][51] In fact, Carr et al. 48 found that levels of yearning were lower for widowed persons whose relationships were conflicted at baseline and higher for those reporting high levels of marital closeness and dependence on their spouses.\nConsistent with the notion that Complicated Grief Disorder is fundamentally an attachment disturbance, we find that insults to a sense of security caused by weak parental bonding in childhood present a vulnerability to the onset of Complicated Grief Disorder later in life. Research has demonstrated that bereaved persons who have experienced childhood abuse and serious neglect have a higher risk for Complicated Grief Disorder as older adults. 37 Furthermore, a recent study has shown childhood separation anxiety to predispose to Complicated Grief Disorder in recently bereaved older adults. 38 Complicated Grief Disorder is also more likely in individuals that are generally averse to lifestyle changes. 52 Advance preparation for the loss [36] as well as having a good support network 53 have been associated with a lower risk for bereavement-related complications. Taken together, these results suggest that bereaved patients with attachment difficulties, and those who feel unprepared before the death and unsupported after it, are at heightened risk of Complicated Grief Disorder. Interventions to promote secure alternative attachments to others and emotional re-engage-UPDATE ON BEREAVEMENT RESEARCH 1195 ment are needed to address the detachment and disengagement that is symptomatic of Complicated Grief Disorder.\nBereaved individuals who lack a good social support network might be greatly helped by group therapy or social support groups. Ogrodnicuk et al. 54 investigated changes in perceived social support after group therapy for patients who developed Complicated Grief Disorder reactions subsequent to a variety of death losses. The study included 61 psychiatric outpatients who received either interpretive or supportive group therapy. Perceptions of social support from 3 different sources (family, friends, a special person) were rated before treatment onset, after treatment completion, and 6 months posttreatment. For patients in both forms of therapy, perceived social support from all 3 sources changed significantly during the follow-up period but not during the treatment period. Additionally, changes (pretherapy to 6month follow-up) in depressive symptomatology were found to be associated with changes in perceived social support. Hence, this study concludes that bereaved individuals perceived support improves after group psychiatric treatment of Complicated Grief Disorder. Furthermore, a reduction in depression severity was associated with these improvements in perceived social support. 54 In this way, lack of social support among bereaved persons is a risk factor for poor adjustment to the loss but both social support and depressive symptomatology appear amenable to treatment.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESILIENT RESPONSES TO BEREAVEMENT", "text": "Bonanno et al. 55,56 have conducted research that demonstrates that some bereaved individuals experience little or no overt distress or disruptions in functioning and appear to be resilient to loss. They state that many bereaved persons \"suffer only minor, transient disruptions in functioning and retain a capacity for positive affect and experiences.\" 57(p827) These findings may appear to run counter to Freud's \"grief work\" formulation 58 that posits adjustment to bereavement requires bereaved individuals to confront and express intense emotions accompanying their loss. 58,59 Stroebe et al. have tested the \"grief work\" hypothesis and conclude that there is no evidence that emotional disclosure facilitates adjustment to loss in normal bereavement. 58 There appears a need to appreciate that many bereaved individuals are able to ad-just to their loss because they are truly resilient in the face of such adversity. Others may not experience intense grief because the loss is not perceived as an extreme threat to their sense of self or to their ability to function-they may be saddened by their loss but do not become excessively dislocated by it. In either of these cases, the benefits of \"grief work\" would appear questionable, as would the need for grief counseling.\nAs noted in the section below on bereavement interventions, to the extent that bereaved people are truly resilient and/or not acutely distressed or impaired by the loss (i.e., that they are neither denying nor avoiding confronting the pain of the loss and are truly able to accept the death and move on with their lives), they would not be classified as having a complicated bereavement reaction. As Jordan and Neimeyer 61 and Schut et al. 62 conclude, most people (perhaps especially resilient individuals) neither need nor substantially benefit from bereavement interventions. Jordan and Neimeyer 61(p772) state, \"With the help of family and friends, apparently most mourners are able to work through and integrate their losses relatively well.\" However, they also note that, \"there are subgroups of mourners who are at elevated risk for dysfunction and who respond well to formal intervention.\" 61(p773 ) Thus, the conclusion drawn from this literature is that resilient bereaved individuals are not likely to benefit substantially from the receipt of such services and, therefore, resources should not be wasted by making such persons the targets of bereavement interventions. More research is needed to understand how and why certain individuals are able to \"move on\" with their lives after a significant interpersonal loss.

It is recommended that clinicians be proactive in identifying the most vulnerable bereaved persons, making an active effort to monitor and follow bereaved individuals likely to be predisposed to complications secondary to bereavement.\nSome bereavement experts have noted that there may be negative, unintended consequences of diagnosing and treating Complicated Grief Disorder. For example, Stroebe et al. 65,66 have expressed concerns that if Complicated Grief Dis-order were recognized as a disorder in the DSM that those receiving a Complicated Grief Disorder diagnosis would be stigmatized by having their bereavement reactions labeled as a form of mental illness. They are apprehensive about the potential withdrawal of the family following the diagnosis and treatment for Complicated Grief Disorder. Such claims that a diagnosis of Complicated Grief Disorder would prove stigmatizing have been made in the absence of data asking bereaved persons about their experiences, thoughts, and feelings regarding their expression of grief and the diagnosis and treatment of intense grief.\nIn one of the first studies to examine this issue directly, Johnson et al. 67  their grief by friends and family, and about their attitudes towards a diagnosis of Complicated Grief Disorder and mental health treatment in general and with respect to Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms in particular. Johnson et al. 67 found that the vast majority of bereaved respondents did not report that their family or friends would be less understanding or more likely to blame them if they received a Complicated Grief Disorder diagnosis (Table 3). For example, less than 3% of the bereaved respondents who did not meet criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder thought their family would be less understanding if they were found to meet criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder, and none of those diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder reported others would be less understanding. Under 7% of the bereaved respondents both who did and who did not meet criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder reported that others outside of their family would ridicule them if they were diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder.\nThe biggest discrepancy between those diagnosed and those not diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder was found for feelings of blame, with 18.8% of those with Complicated Grief Disorder reporting that their family would be more likely to blame them for how they are if they were diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder compared to approximately 2% of those without Complicated Grief Disorder who thought their family would blame them more. Respondents with more severe grief symptoms were also significantly more likely than those with milder grief symptoms to report that friends or family members had told them that they were exaggerating their grief symptoms, feeling sorry for themselves, or using grief to get attention. 67 These findings suggest that family members and friends may feel upset and frustrated by the anguish they observe in the bereaved survivor with Complicated Grief Disorder, feelings that might be minimized by the effective treatment of bereavement-related emotional distress.\nRespondents who met criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder reported positive attitudes toward this diagnosis. Specifically, nearly 94% of those who met criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder indicated that they would be relieved to know that they had a recognizable problem and all (100%) said that they would be receptive to treatment for their symptoms (see Table 3). 67 These data suggest that a diagnosis may enhance family understanding of their distress. Because receptivity to treatment is high among those diagnosed with Com-plicated Grief Disorder, it may be that once someone is diagnosed with this disorder they will be more likely to recognize and respond to the need for help. As a result of effective treatment for Complicated Grief Disorder, others may react less negatively to the bereaved individual because they would, presumably, not be confronted with the painful display of sorrow common among persons diagnosed with Complicated Grief Disorder.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TREATMENT FOR COMPLICATED BEREAVEMENT", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Preloss interventions", "text": "If health care professionals approach taking care of bereaved individuals as part of their duty and an integral part of end-of-life care, then attempts might be made pre-loss to offset future distress and impairment in bereaved caregivers. Barry et al. 35 evaluated the association between bereaved persons' perceptions of the death (e.g. extent of suffering, violent versus peaceful death), preparedness for the death, and psychiatric disorders. The sample was 122 persons who received a baseline interview at approximately 4 months post-loss and a follow-up interview 5 months later, at approximately 9 months postloss. In addition to the bivariate associations between perceptions of circumstances of death and psychiatric outcomes, multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the extent to which perceptions of the death were associated with the likelihood of psychiatric disorders in survivors at baseline and follow-up. Barry et al. 35 found in the adjusted analyses that the perception of death as more violent was associated with Major Depressive Disorder at 4 months postloss. Additionally, the perception of lack of preparedness for the death was associated with Complicated Grief Disorder at 4 and 9 months post loss. A recent study of dementia caregivers by Hebert and colleagues 68 showed similar results. In this study, the 23% of caregivers who perceived themselves as unprepared for the death had a 2 to 3 times greater likelihood of depression and complicated grief \"caseness\" than those who felt prepared. These findings suggest that palliative care clinicians might be able to enhance adjustment to the loss by assisting family caregivers of dying patients by promoting greater acceptance among survivors. In order to reduce feelings of guilt or regret, clinicians providing palliative care might ZHANG ET AL. 1198 facilitate preparing survivors for the impending death, encouraging them to say their \"goodbyes\" and to address unresolved issues.\nOther research has shown that early hospice enrollment is associated with a reduced risk of Major Depressive Disorder during the first 6-8 months of bereavement. 69 These results are consistent with Barry et al. 35 and Hebert et al. 68 because early hospice enrollment would appear to be associated with greater preparedness for the death. Similarly, a study conducted in The Netherlands 70 indicated that bereaved family and friends of patients with cancer who died by euthanasia had less severe grief symptoms and posttraumatic stress reactions than the bereaved of comparable cancer patients who died a natural death. Because family members of patients who opted for euthanasia would be expected to be more accepting of and prepared for the death than those who did not, these factors may account for the lower levels of grief. The results of a study by Christakis and Iwashyna 71 that compared mortality rates in patients who enrolled in hospice versus those who did not found that hospice care was associated with better survival among the bereaved caregivers. These authors reason that the survival advantage of hospice patient bereaved persons may be a function of the supportive type of end-of-life care provided by hospice that may minimize the stress of bereavement. It may well be that the survival benefits of hospice are mediated by better mental health among bereaved caregivers.\nThese results suggest that palliative care may be able to play a more proactive role in preventive interventions for Complicated Grief Disorder and other problems that occur secondary to bereavement. For example, using a \"hope for the best, plan for the worst\" approach, palliative care services and hospices might assist families in attending to affairs that they would like to have \"in order\" before they die. Families might be made to realize that there is a high probability that the patient's life expectancy is limited and that they may want to make an effort to visit with the patient and express things they may want to share with him/her (e.g., appreciation, regrets, reassurances) before it is too late. Because the results also demonstrate the benefits to the surviving caregiver of early versus late hospice enrollment, this suggests that health care professionals should be encouraged to recommend hospice and palliative care services when it is appropriate to do so, and not delay referral, in order to prevent the prolongation of suffering for the patient, enhance the likelihood of a peaceful ending, and promote the family's preparation for their loss, which may lower the risk of psychological disturbances after the death such as Complicated Grief Disorder and/or Major Depressive Disorder.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Postloss interventions.", "text": "It is surprising how limited the evidence base is with respect to the efficacy of bereavement interventions.

To date, there have been no randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapies for the reduction of grief symptom severity. Open trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been conducted and suggest the promise of these and similar agents for the reduction of Complicated Grief Disorder symptom severity, 46 but randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed before more definitive conclusions can be drawn about their efficacy for the amelioration of Complicated Grief Disorder symptomatology.\nWith respect to psychotherapeutic interventions designed for acutely distressed bereaved individuals, Shear et al. 63 recently published a randomized, controlled trial of a manualized psychotherapy developed specifically for complicated grief-Complicated Grief Disorder treatment. This study compared the newly developed Complicated Grief Disorder Treatment with Interpersonal Psychotherapy among patients from a universitybased psychiatric research clinic and a satellite clinic in a low-income African American community. Participants found to meet criteria for Complicated Grief Disorder were randomly assigned to receive IPT (n \u03ed 46) or complicated grief treatment (n \u03ed 49); both were administered in 16 sessions during an average interval of 19 weeks per participant. Treatment response was defined either as an independent evaluator-rated Clinical Global Improvement score of 1 or 2 or as time to a 20-point or better improvement in the self-reported Inventory of complicated grief. Results indicated that both treatments significantly reduced Complicated Grief Disorder symptoms, but the response rate was greater for complicated grief treatment (51%) than for IPT (28%; p \u03ed .02) and the time to response was shorter for Complicated Grief Disorder treatment (p \u03ed .02). This randomized, controlled trial of a psychotherapy for Complicated Grief Disorder provides a solid evidence-base for guiding clinical intervention with bereaved persons with this newly defined disorder.\nStill, important questions about the efficacy of Complicated Grief Therapy remain. The approach is very comprehensive, yet highly eclectic, including psychoeducation about normal grief and Complicated Grief Disorder, attention to the dual processes of adaptive coping (\"adjusting to the loss\" and \"restoration of a satisfying life\"), and the ap-plication of motivational enhancement techniques to elicit and redefine the bereaved person's life goals. Consequently, it is difficult to discern the mechanism(s) of action that contribute to the treatment's efficacy. Predicated on a model in which grief is conceptualized as a trauma, complicated grief treatment applies exposure therapy to target the traumatic avoidance presumed to be experienced by persons with Complicated Grief Disorder. In this way, the bereaved survivor is desensitized to traumatic images of the deceased and thoughts about the death through an imagined conversation with the deceased and a retelling of the death scene. It is, therefore, not surprising that the results showed greater efficacy for traumatic compared with non-traumatic deaths. For deaths from non-traumatic circumstances, however, research 13,14,36 fails to find evidence of traumatic, phobic avoidance. Avoidance is more related to reminders of the permanence of the loss and the absence of the deceased and the need to move on in life. The issues of attachment, separation, loss and reattachment appear paramount in Complicated Grief Disorder, 26,28,[36][37][38][39][40][41]48,50,51,53 suggesting the focus on these issues in the conversation with the deceased may be especially therapeutic.\nOther promising psychotherapeutic techniques for Complicated Grief Disorder are William Piper's interpretative and supportive therapies 54,74 and Mardi Horowitz' integrated cognitive-dynamic approach to case formulation and treatment, 74,75 although conclusive results of the efficacy of these treatments await publication of randomized, controlled trials.", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY OF GRIEF", "text": "Some of the most intriguing work today on grief and bereavement has focused on examining the functional neuroanatomy of grief, which has not been studied previously in functional neuroimaging research.

In a study by Gundel et al., 76 grief was elicited in bereaved women through photographs of the deceased combined with words specific to the death event. Three brain regions were independently activated by the picture and word factors: the posterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and the medial/supe-rior frontal gyrus.

The effects of prognostic awareness coupled with a sense of inner peace are unknown. Methods: In the multisite, longitudinal Coping with Cancer Study, 280 patients with advanced cancer were interviewed at baseline. Patients defining themselves as \"terminally ill\" and/or \"at peace\" most days were paired with others on sociodemographic, mental health and advance care planning. Primary caregivers of deceased patients were interviewed 6 months postloss and compared on their physical and mental health and their perceptions of patients' end-of-life care and death. Results: Overall, 17.5% of patients reported being both peaceful and aware. Peacefully aware patients had lower rates of psychological distress and higher rates of advance care planning (e.g., completing do-not-resuscitate [DNR] orders, advance care planning discussions with physicians) than those who were not peacefully aware. Additionally, peacefully aware patients had the highest overall quality of death as reported by their caretakers in a postmortem evaluation. Surviving caregivers of peacefully aware patients were more physically and mentally healthy 6 months postloss than caregivers of patients who were \"aware\" but not peaceful. Conclusions: Patients with advanced cancer who are peacefully aware have better mental health and quality of death outcomes, and their surviving caregivers have better bereavement outcomes.

[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is well known that many physicians consciously overestimate survival times when communicating with patients in order to preserve hope. 7,8 However, studies have shown that the acceptance of a terminal prognosis can lead to positive outcomes such as more appropriate end-of-life care decisions that do not prolong the suffering of the patient. 9 Indeed, if physi-cians withhold prognostic information indefinitely from patients, they may be depriving patients and their caregivers of the valuable opportunity to accept and prepare for death. The knowledge of a limited life expectancy may aid and encourage families to arrange end-of-life care options such as hospice. In fact, studies show that preparedness and services such as hospice lead to lower rates of psychological disorders among bereaved caregivers. 10,11 In a previous study, prognostic awareness was associated with positive advance care outcomes, as well as increased psychological distress. 12 As a follow-up to these findings, in this study, we focus on the effects of peacefulness among patients with advanced cancer, specifically, those who are aware of being terminally ill. Given the possible benefits of prognostic awareness, it is important to examine further (1) whether there is a subgroup of aware patients who are at peace and (2) the factors associated with peaceful awareness in the terminally ill.\nOur study isolated a subset of terminally ill patients who were not only aware of their prognosis, but also felt a \"deep sense of peace and harmony.\" Using data from a multisite, longitudinal study of patients with advanced cancer, we examined the way in which patients' baseline awareness of terminal illness and sense of peace individually and jointly influenced their mental health, advance care planning, quality of death, and caregiver bereavement outcomes. Our hypothesis was that patients who were both peaceful and aware of their terminal prognosis would represent the optimal case in which both mental health and positive end-of-life care outcomes are retained.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study sample", "text": "Patients were recruited in the period from August 1, 2002 to Augusts 25, 2005 as part of an ongoing, multi-institutional longitudinal observational study (MH63892, CA106370) of a cohort of patients with advanced cancer and their primary, informal (unpaid) caregivers in the Coping With Cancer Study. Participating sites included the Yale Cancer Center (New Haven, Connecticut), the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System Comprehensive Cancer Clinics (West Haven, Connecticut), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, New York), Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (Dallas, Texas), and the Parkland Hospital Palliative Care Service (Dallas, Texas). Approval was obtained from the human subjects committees of all participating centers; all enrolled patients provided written informed consent.\nInclusion criteria for the study were: (1) diagnosis of advanced cancer (presence of distant metastases and failure of first-line chemotherapy); (2) diagnosis at a participating site; (3) age 20 years or older; (4) unpaid, informal caregiver, as identified by the patient; and (5) adequate stamina to complete the interview. Patient-caregiver dyads in which either the patient or caregiver met criteria for dementia or delirium (by neurobehavioral cognitive status examination) or did not speak either English or Spanish were excluded. Potentially eligible patients were identified by oncology staff at each site. Trained research staff approached each identified patient to offer participation in the study by telephone call or hospital visit.\nOnce the patient's written informed consent was obtained, medical records and clinicians were consulted to confirm eligibility. Of the 538 eligible patients who were approached for inclusion into the study, 338 patients were enrolled. Of these, 280 patients provided a response to the questions regarding prognosis and peacefulness that form the basis for this study. The most common reasons for nonparticipation included \"not interested\" (n \u03ed 94), \"caregiver refuses\" (n \u03ed 27), and \"too upset\" (n \u03ed 18), and \"other\" (n \u03ed 61).

The NIA/Fetzer Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality for Use in Health Research 13 was included as an assessment of general spiritual experiences. In this questionnaire, patients were asked to rate the statement, \"I feel deep inner peace or harmony,\" on a scale of 1-6, where 1 \u03ed \"many times a day\" and 6 \u03ed \"never or almost never.\" The median response for the study sample was 3 (\"most days\"). For analyses, the responses were stratified such that those with responses 3 or more (\"most days\") were coded 1 (\"peaceful\"); otherwise responses were coded as 2. Steinhauser et al. 14 showed that a one-item assessment of peacefulness was strongly correlated with emotional and spiritual well-being, faith and purpose subscales, and had broad applicability across different definitions of spirituality.\nPatient Evaluation of Health. Patients were asked the question, \"How would you describe your cur-rent health status?\" and responses were 1, \"relatively healthy\"; 2, \"seriously but not terminally ill\"; and 3, \"seriously and terminally ill.\" Patients who responded 3 (\"seriously and terminally ill\") were coded 1 (\"terminal illness acknowledgment\"). Others were coded 2 (\"no terminal illness acknowledgment\"). This scale has been shown to be associated with \"matter-of-fact\" disclosure of prognosis by physicians, as well as with receipt of exclusively palliative care. 15 McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire. This questionnaire, 16 designed for patients at all stages of illness, contains items related to global, physical, psychological, emotional, and existential well-being. Each item uses a 10-point scale, where 0 is desirable and 10 is undesirable. Items were reverse-coded as needed for consistency of presentation.\nYale Evaluation of Suicidality. This 13-item structured questionnaire, with proven reliability and validity, 17 was administered to determine suicidality in patients.

DSM-IV Mental Disorder Diagnoses. The Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) Axis I Modules 18 was used to diagnose current major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder (PD).

The patients who are peaceful and aware show comparatively low lev-els of psychological distress, while retaining the benefits of awareness by having better advance care outcomes (e.g., increased rates of end-of-life conversations with their physicians, increased rates of DNR order completion, as well as decreased interest in heroic measures to prolong life). Thus, peacefulness and terminal illness awareness taken together describe a potential advantageous mental state for the patient with advanced cancer population.\nAlthough similar proportions of the aware and unaware groups were peaceful, the difference in the subsets without peace was remarkable. Patients who were aware, but not peaceful, were significantly more likely to be \"sad\" and \"terrified\" compared to patients in any other subgroup. While awareness does not decrease the prevalence of peacefulness, it does affect those who are not at peace more negatively.\nThis indicates the importance of improving identification of and interventions for the group of patients with advanced cancer who realize that they are dying and are not at peace with this realization.\nWe also examine the possible effects of the cancer patient's mental state on the caregiver's experience. These results show that peaceful awareness in the patient can positively influence certain measures of the caregiver's physical and RAY ET AL. 1366 mental health, including caregivers' regrets postloss. The findings in this study would imply that peace of mind in terminally ill patients is potentially protective for caregivers. A recent study 23 found that anxiety in patients was significantly associated with anxiety in caregivers, but no study has looked at this prospectively. Further research is needed to determine how the mental state of dying patients influences the post-loss psychological morbidity experienced by bereaved caregivers.\nAlso, patients' peaceful awareness was associated with the caregivers' statements that a doctor was always in charge of a patients' care and that a doctor or medical staff discussed treatment preferences with the patient. There are two possible interpretations for this. One is that the patient-doctor relationship has a positive effect on the patient's state of mind, and it provides a modifiable factor that may lead to better patient outcomes. The other interpretation is that patients who are peacefully aware are simply more open to discussions with physicians regarding their future care. Future research should focus on how reliable physician involvement and improved communication between physicians, patients and their families are associated with concrete psychosocial benefits, in the short-term for patients and in the long-term for caregivers.\nThe findings of this study should be considered in the context of a sample in which nonparticipants were more likely to be distressed in comparison to participants. Thus, the results presented here reflect a conservative estimate of psychological distress. The one-item measure for peacefulness is psychometrically limited and development of a more extensive scale for assessing peace at the end of life is needed. As these analyses indicate, peacefulness was not associated with MDD or GAD. It was significantly inversely related to wish for death. Further analyses revealed that peacefulness was inversely related to demoralization (e.g., symptoms of anger/bitterness at the diagnosis, feeling of no control over life, days as a burden, life as meaningless and without purpose). In additional subanalyses, peacefulness was significantly associated with spirituality, however much of the variance remained unexplained. Future research is needed to refine our understanding of peacefulness at the end of life. The caregiver bereavement outcome data are limited by the number of patients who had died at the time of analysis. Fu-ture research can determine the generalizability of these results to terminal illnesses other than cancer.\nFurther research should focus on the subset of patients who are not at peace in order to identify factors and interventions that promote peaceful awareness, e.g., relationships with clinicians and family caregivers, patient and family expectations, discussions regarding available end-of-life care options and specific coping strategies and conceptual frameworks. Additional research should also examine potential outcomes of peaceful awareness, such as improved quality of care at the end of life and beneficial effects on bereaved caregivers.\nA clear understanding of prognosis can have real, beneficial impact on the experience of the patient and caregivers. However, this study indicates the importance of considering the subtle distinctions among those who are aware of their terminal prognosis. Just as one subset of patients may become despondent, another subset may rise to the challenge. This study shows us that the ideal of peaceful awareness exists; further research is now needed to examine clinical interventions at the end of life that may guide psychologically distressed patients toward this ideal.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This research was supported in part by the following grants: MH63892 from the National Institute of Mental Health (HGP), CA106370 from the National Cancer Institute (HGP), and a grant from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AR, HGP).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Communicating prognosis in cancer care: A systematic review", "journal": "Ann Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "R G Hagerty; P N Butow; P M Ellis; S Dimitry; Mhn Tatersall"}, {"title": "Communicating with realism and hope: Incurable cancer patients' views on the disclosure of prognosis", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "R G Hagerty; P N Butow; P M Ellis; E A Lobb; S C Pendlebury; N Leighl; C Macleod; M H Tattersall"}, {"title": "Fostering coping and nurturing hope when discussing the future with terminally ill cancer patients and their caregivers", "journal": "Cancer", "year": "2005", "authors": "J M Clayton; P N Butow; R M Arnold; Mhn Tattersall"}, {"title": "Cancer patient preferences for communication of prognosis in the metastatic setting", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2004", "authors": "R G Hagerty; P N Butow; P A Ellis; E A Lobb; S Pendlebury; N Leighl; D Goldstein; S K Lo; M H Tattersall"}, {"title": "Prognosis communication in serious illness: Perceptions of older patients, caregivers, and clinicians", "journal": "J Am Geratri Soc", "year": "2003", "authors": "T R Fried; E H Bradley; O Leary; J "}, {"title": "Necessary collusion: Prognostic communication with advanced cancer patients", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "P R Helft"}, {"title": "Prognostic disclosure to patients with cancer near the end of life", "journal": "Ann Intern Med", "year": "2001", "authors": "E B Lamont; N A Christakis"}, {"title": "Defining cancer patients as being in the terminal phase: Who receives a formal diagnosis, and what are the effects?", "journal": "J Clin", "year": "2005", "authors": "B Aabom; J Kragstrup; H Vondeling; L S Bakketeig; H Stovring"}, {"title": "Relationship between cancer patients' predictions of prognosis and their treatment preferences", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1998", "authors": "J C Weeks; E F Cook; S J O'day; L M Peterson; N Wenger; D Reding; F E Harrell; P Kussin; N V Dawson; A F Connors; J Lynn; R S Phillips"}, {"title": "Psychiatric disorders among bereaved persons: the role of perceived circumstances of death and preparedness for death", "journal": "Am J Geriatr Psychiatry", "year": "2002", "authors": "L C Barry; S V Kasl; H G Prigerson"}, {"title": "Depression among surviving caregivers: Does length of hospice enrollment matter?", "journal": "Am J Psychiatry", "year": "2004", "authors": "E H Bradley; H Prigerson; Mda Carlson; E Cherlin; R Johnson-Hurzeler; S V Kasl"}, {"title": "Terminal illness acknowledgment in advanced cancer patients", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "A Ray; V A Jackson; S D Block; H G Prigerson"}, {"title": "Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality for Use in Health Research: A Report of the Fetzer/National Institute on Aging Working Group", "journal": "", "year": "1999", "authors": " Nia/Fetzer"}, {"title": "One item to probe spiritual concerns at the end of life", "journal": "Arch Intern Med", "year": "2006", "authors": "K E Steinhauser; C I Voils; E C Clipp; H B Bosworth; N A Christakis; J A Tulsky"}, {"title": "Socialization to dying: social determinants of death acknowledgment and treatment among terminally ill geriatric patients", "journal": "J Health Soc Behav", "year": "1992", "authors": "H G Prigerson"}, {"title": "Validity of the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire in the palliative care setting: A multi-centre Canadian study demonstrating the importance of the existential domain", "journal": "Palliat Med", "year": "1997", "authors": "S R Cohen; B M Mount; E Bruera; M Provost; J Rowe; K Tong"}, {"title": "Suicidality and bereavement: Complicated grief as psychiatric disorder presenting greatest risk for suicidality", "journal": "Suicide Life Threat Behav", "year": "2004", "authors": "A E Latham; H G Prigerson"}, {"title": "The structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R (SCID): II.

The great questions about life, meaning, responsibility, existential isolation, and death are suddenly part of everyday life. 1 This type of crisis is normally labeled a psychological or traumatic crisis 2 but ultimately it is a profound existential crisis, as the patient's life, as well as the everyday life and the future of the family members are threatened.\nAccording to philosophers like Mijuskovic 3 and Tillich, 4 all living creatures are basically alone and isolated. To live is to exist in a body that is separated from everyone else's. Each person is unique and a total emotional community between two individuals can never fully be reached. 5 Man is not only lonely, but he is also aware of this existential predicament. 1,6 Existential isolation is a basic challenge. This experience of loneliness is on one level shared by everyone. Experience of loneliness is also a driving force that makes us search for company and create relationships. 7,8 Solitude that is actively chosen can be positive and fill an important function. Involuntary isolation, however, is very different from this. In such instances one is thrown upon one's own re-sources, despite a strong will to be with others. 9 Such loneliness is negative and associated with an experience of forlornness. 8 Involuntary loneliness is also something that is linked to guilt and social failure. 10 Such experiences are therefore something one wants to hide from others. Incurable diseases often activate feelings of involuntary loneliness, or at least fear of loneliness. 9,[11][12][13][14][15] In the psychological literature from Western societies there are different definitions of loneliness and varying opinions of the cause of loneliness. However, many scientists agree on a definition that divides loneliness in three categories: interpersonal (social), intrapersonal, and existential loneliness. 1,16 The borderlines are neither sharp nor absolute. The three forms of loneliness are intertwined and affect each other.\nSeveral authors state that the experiences of loneliness are closely related to death and are one of the factors that make dying distressing. 12,15.17-20 Death is designated as the occurrence that more than anything else symbolizes man's profound loneliness and the inevitable separation and isolation from others 8,13 and the one event when existential loneliness is most evident. 6 Despite the fact that loneliness has been investigated by researchers in different branches of science, to our knowledge, the existential isolation experienced in association with an incurable disease has not yet been systematically studied.

Twelve of the patients were women and 8 were men. The mean age was 63 and the range was 21 to 91 years of age. The diagnoses varied, as did the time of diagnosed illness. Among the next of kin, 12 were spouses or cohabitants, the other 8 were children, parents, or siblings.

The same questions were posed to the patients and family members. Depending on the response, further questions were posed, in order to explore, deepen, and validate the answers. 23 The interviews lasted between 45 and 105 minutes and were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim, mainly by the first author.\nTheoretical Framework and Analysis. Data were analyzed by the two authors (a social worker and a consultant in palliative medicine and researcher with long experience in qualitative methods). Both authors have long clinical experience as palliative care specialists.\nInterpretation was based on existential psychological theory. 1 In existential psychology a person's own subjective experiences are central. Investigation focuses on how he or she relates to basic existential questions about life and death, togetherness and isolation, meaning and emptiness, freedom, and external structure.\nData were analyzed by using existential hermeneutics. When choosing a hermeneutic approach, the aim is to get a deeper understanding of the expressed meaning and implicit issues [23][24][25] and to elucidate the autonomous meaning of the text. It was important to choose a method that offered opportunities for interpretation, since the interviews concerned questions about death and dying, topics where there are good reasons to assume that the informant would not give explicit expressions due to fear or defense mechanisms. 1,26,27 In this study the analysis has followed and considered seven principles for hermeneutical interpretation, as described by Radnitzky 28 and adapted and extended by Kvale. 23 These principles are: (1) continuous back and forth process between the parts and the whole; (2) interpretation ends when a good gestalt is reached, an inner unity of the text, free from logical contradictions; (3) testing the partial interpretations against the global meaning of the text; (4) autonomy of the text, i.e., the text should also be understood on the basis of its own frame of reference; (5) germeneutical explication of a text concerns knowledge about the theme of the text; (6) an interpretation of a text is not presuppositionless; and (7) every interpretation involves innovation and creativity. This method has previously been used for similar research questions by our group and is presented in detail elsewhere. 26,29 In short, the analysis was performed in the following steps: The transcribed interview was at first read through without presumptions (na\u00efve reading) in order to gain a general picture of the content. In a second, more careful reading, meaning bearing units were coded preliminarily. In the next step these units were scrutinized, this time with focus on the potential underlying meaning. In this phase of the analysis it was possible to distinguish themes. When needed, extensive parts of the transcriptions were condensed 30 and in order to focus on the core information and to illuminate this, the text was abstracted. Alternative interpretations were tested and compared, by means of juxtapositioning. 31 The most plausible inherent meaning (when studying the parts) was then compared to the entire text (the whole) in order to test the interpretation. This procedure, of comparing the parts with the whole was repeated several times, according to the hermeneutic spiral. The analysis was ended and the categories were labeled when the interpretation seemed coherent without logical contradictions. This is, normally referred to as a \"good gestalt\" in hermeneutic analysis.\nThe results are presented both in the form of parts (categories) and as \"a whole,\" where the whole represents a synthesis of the categories.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Trustworthiness", "text": "During the interviews a dialogical validation was performed. 30 Similar questions were posed in different situations, in order to be sure that the informant's view was captured in a reasonable way.

In certain circumstances this vulnerability became tangible (Table 2).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Parts", "text": "Changes-Reduced Protection Changed life conditions-changed existential protection. The reality of the illness had transmuted death from something abstract concerning others, to something real, concrete, and highly relevant. Both patients and next-of-kin experienced that they now had thoughts and feelings impossible for others to really comprehend. Another consequence was that the family members no longer shared the same future or long-term life plans. Thus, plans related to family life, in some cases educational plans, career, grandchildren, or retirement had to be abandoned. Altered everyday circumstances-loss of everyday protection. Some of the external togetherness with others that was previously evident ceased to exist, both for the patients and the family members. They did not have the strength to socialize with friends or participate in leisure activities in the same way as previously. For the patient, even the inner sense of togetherness in the family was affected as routines were changed and family roles were shifted.\nWhen the opportunities for togetherness decreased, the possibilities to seek protection in social company were reduced, leading to unwanted reminders of one's existential loneliness and fear of death. This created an urge to meet family and friends and a need to see everyday life going on. A synthesis of these parts forms the integrated \"whole,\" in agreement with the hermeneutic circle. The synthesis of the parts (\"as a whole\") is presented at the end of the Results section.\naway from life and in that way I have no protection from it (life) when I feel my anxiety coming. Do you think this anxiety is related to thoughts about death?\nYes I think so, or for my own part I know that it is so. Death and loneliness are in a way associated. Maybe one is scared of death, just because one is afraid that death will mean that you will become totally alone. 19a\nEmotional changes-one's own and other's. Both patients and next-of-kin described feelings that were no longer familiar to them. Some informants also described an existence with an altered energy of life, which could cause feelings of lost control. Sometimes the changes were great and really noticeable.\nFrom \"I considered myself as calm . . . I guess I was . . . an ordinary person\" to \"my temper is a disaster\" and \"the best thing for me is to be dead\" [5a] is one example when the changes were so profound that it was difficult to cope with the situation, both for the patient and for others.\nThe pathologic changes of the body-unfamiliar and frightening for all involved. Patients could experience that their own bodies, which they earlier had relied on, now began to fail and former bodily power had been swept away. Such changes had also affected the next-of-kin both emotionally and practically. Treatments with severe side effects and operations had sometimes injured the body in such a way that the patient's relationship to it had partly changed from familiarity to unfamiliarity.\nBeing aware of something inside one's own body that was growing without control and creating feelings of repulsion could result in the perception of powerlessness and estrangement. And it's not as when you have a cold that disappears, it is here to stay for ever . . . will always be there. It feels scary, I think, like a monster that is inside of me. And then I can feel an even stronger urge to go training in order to curse (and challenge) this misery 2a\nObserving how the sick body suffered very tangible changes caused by the disease or by treatment could provoke feelings of fear, helplessness and powerlessness even within the next-of-kin.\nSymptoms from the body that were experienced as embarrassing could lead to withdrawal from other people. Not being able to eat and drink as before had a great impact on the social togetherness surrounding meals. This affected the whole family. In cases in which the patient tried to overcome the embarrassment and decided to see friends anyhow, the effort sometimes resulted in feelings of being cut off from former togetherness and in feelings of isolation that in a reality were impossible for others to really understand. One concrete example follows. One of the patients went out with his old friends as he had done several times before, but this time he wore diapers and he no longer felt part of the circle of friends.\nIf the bodily and emotional changes were very obvious and profound, this could result in experiences of being restricted, without the possibility of reaching out to others. It was impossible to find protection from feelings about the impending death, not inside oneself nor among others. One was confronted with thorough feelings of existential loneliness. One of the patients said, Have you told anyone that you are afraid of being alone? No, no that would not be possible . . .\nWhy not? It's so unlike me . . . it's fully enough with all the other changes (shows with a gesture over his body)\nIs there anything else that you think about on your own?

Patient suffering was a reminder of how life-threatening the disease really was: the lonely feelings that were provoked were considered something difficult to share with others.

The explanations for this are varied.\nCommunicating loneliness is still difficult and something people hesitate to discuss because, at least in western societies, loneliness is a sign of failure 33 and therefore suggests shame. The low status of loneliness could contribute to making it a subject that is neither mentioned nor asked about.\nThe threatening dimension of existential loneliness also makes it difficult to talk about. It is closely related to death and one of the feelings that can evoke fear of death. 1,6,8,13 Undisguised anxiety is a very painful experience that is hard to endure and therefore quickly overcome by defence mechanisms. 26 The raw fear of death is rapidly transformed into a feeling less threatening and more possible to cope with. 1,13 The informants described how they had stressful thoughts and feelings they wished to share with others but they found it impossible to do so. This is in good agreement with the writings of the Swedish tanatologist Loma Feigenberg. 12 He describes how thoughts about the impending death dominate inside a patient with a life-threatening disease, but what is noticeable of that from the outside is only a pale reflection.\nNot all families talk in an open way about things concerning a life-threatening disease. Mutual openness is not always easy 9,34 and not always worth striving for. 35 In the interviews the respondents expressed desires to protect their loved ones from thoughts and feelings that could be upsetting, which is a well-known phenomenon. 17 Therefore, some of them chose not to speak openly about the disease and the impending death. Sometimes the reason for not sharing feelings was that the patient was convinced that healthy people were unable to understand and that it was useless even to try, an experience that has also been described in the literature previously. 19 Despite different, even good reasons to avoid talking about one's own situation, communication is still an essential and important source of SAND AND STRANG 1384 FIG. 1. Various changes and circumstances that were manifest or triggered by the bodily deterioration induced feelings of existential loneliness.\nthe experience of affinity and togetherness. 8 The desire to be seen, acknowledged and respected is a basic human need. 36 When Yalom 1 writes about different forms of loneliness he stresses the lack of absolute boarders between them. On the contrary the borders are semipermeable. That means that they can both interact and masquerade. It is therefore plausible that the informants' experiences of interpersonal (social), intrapersonal or existential loneliness were all transformed into a common experience of existential isolation that is the type of loneliness that is intimately intertwined with death. 8 In this process the patient's exposed body had a major significance.\nSeveral researchers have described how significant the body is for the identity of a human being. Freud 37 described the ego as being a \"bodily ego\" and according to Merleau-Ponty 38 human beings both have and are a body. He states that the human subject, as well as her consciousness, are bodily based, and that she relates to himself or herself and others primarily through his or her body. As a result of this, changes in the body can influence a person's whole identity and how she experiences and relates 39,40 and thus a disease can give rise to experiences of unfamiliarity and homelessness. [41][42][43] Still, none of these revisions developed their discussion further or included the body as a probable source of existential loneliness.\nThe results from this current study point out that this is the case, but it is important to emphasize that the results are valid for a severely ill body and that data cannot be directly transferred to other contexts. As a rule, a healthy body is possible to control directly and by mental power. It is possible to neglect small aches and pains and pull oneself together if the body is tired. However, if you are aware that you or a next-of-kin are seriously ill, and you develop symptoms that are strong reminders of the impending death, this is harder to manage. In such cases, symptoms and symptom relief are about life and death.\nSometimes the term \"skin hunger\" is used in descriptions of how important it is for the human body to be touched. 44,45 When the hunger is not satisfied this could be called an \"physical loneliness,\" a term that is rarely used. When one has a body with transudations, discharges, and noises, one looks different, aches, and sometimes smells bad 46 it can be difficult for all involved to meet and be intimate or even stay close. In the same way it may be difficult to cope with the fact that parts of the body are surgically removed or that new details such as subcutaneous venous accesses, stomas or drains are added.\nThe patients also stressed how strong feelings of existential loneliness were evoked when their bodies were touched in a nonempathetic way. Common words were not always sufficient for those descriptions and metaphors for animals, e.g., \"treated like a pig\" were used instead. When the vulnerable body is indifferently touched by someone whom the patient is dependent upon for care, existential feelings of loneliness can arise. One feels loneliness when at someone else's mercy. 15,40 Among patients with a serious cancer diagnosis, bodily changes can occur very rapidly. When that is the case, there is neither time nor opportunity for those who are affected to undergo a psychosocial transition and integrate what is happening emotionally and existentially. 47 This circumstance is another factor that could increase the risk of feelings of unfamiliarity and loneliness.\nExperiences of loneliness among next-of-kin who were left alone with responsibilities that they experienced as hard to handle are described in several reports. 29,[48][49][50] The fact that the disease is incurable adds a profound existential dimension to the sometimes overwhelming responsibility and the insufficiency the next-of-kin experienced. Mistakes at the hospital, the patient's inability to eat and insufficient pain control were all transformed into concern about life and death: so were the feelings of powerlessness and loneliness in the next-of kin.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Methodological considerations", "text": "We aimed at a maximum variation sampling, in order to cover as many aspects of the phenomenon as possible.

This knowledge is most important and it should be useful for all providers of palliative care. Yalom 1 stresses that everyone must carry his or her existential loneliness, no relationship can eliminate it, but \"love compensates for the pain of isolation.\" We drew a similar conclusion from our study: the power and possibilities in empathic human encounters, also between care providers and patients, may partly compensate for the pain of isolation. Therefore, when patients and next-of-kin are treated with empathic understanding together with the time and attention given, it would be possible for them to relate. This will not eliminate, but at least assuage their feelings of loneliness.\nThe impact of the physical body and physical suffering as a trigger of existential loneliness was striking in our study. In order to minimize existential loneliness, we have to be observant of all kinds of bodily discomfort, as the body, especially during severe illness, influences the psychological and existential well being. Or as Merleau-Ponty 38 expresses it: we do not only have a body, but in our existences we are bodies. Hands are powerful instruments that we all are provided with and a sensible use of our hands could have the greatest impact.\nThe body of a person with a life-threatening disease is very vulnerable. When it is touched by \"speedy hands, impatient hands\" that \"hasten to get ready,\" those hands do not merely give signals about stress. They limit or make communication and mutual togetherness impossible, and open up for feelings of existential loneliness.

Some patient populations are more likely to be undertreated than others, and patient race and ethnicity have been associated with disparities in this type of care.\nIn December 2004, the National Institutes of Health convened a State-of-the-Science Conference on \"Improving End-of-Life Care.\" This conference produced a statement that while asserting \"in general, research on the patient, family, and system factors that improve or worsen outcomes is limited,\" acknowledged \"race, culture, and ethnicity . . . are associated with disparities in access to health care, quality of health care delivery, and health care outcomes.\" 10 Moreover, \"disparities have been shown in the treatment of pain in end-of-life care.\" 10 As interest in understanding the influence of patient race and ethnicity on access to effective pain treatment grows, so does the body of evidence addressing this phenomenon.

Such is the aim of this study.

Table 1 provides a summary of each study. Three studies examined the effect of patient race/ethnicity on pain assessment [14][15][16] and found conflicting results. Anderson and colleagues 14 found that physicians underestimated pain severity for 64% of Hispanic and 74% of African-American patients with cancer, and Bernabei and colleagues 15 observed that minority patients are significantly less likely than whites to have their pain recorded even after accounting for language differences. However, Todd and colleagues 16 observed that patient ethnicity was not predictive of a disparity between physician and patient pain assessment in emergency department patients with long-bone fracture.\nWe identified 17 studies that examined analgesic prescribing patterns: 10 were retrospective cohort studies [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] and 1 prospective, 27 3 were secondary analyses of a large geriatric epidemiology study, 15,17,28 2 were analyses of nationally representative health care databases, 29,30 and 1 was an analysis of administrative data. 31 Seven studies examined analgesic prescribing in the emergency department for long-bone fracture [17][18][19][20]29,30 and nontraumatic low-back pain, 27,30 4 examined postoperative pain management, [21][22][23][24] 3 examined chronic nonmalignant pain management, 25,26,28 and 1 examined cancer pain management. 15 One study concentrated on management of pain in children, 29 2 examined prescribing for older adults in long-term care settings, 15,28 and 2 examined prescribing for veterans. 25,26 Eleven (65%) of these studies observed significant ethnic/racial disparities in analgesic prescribing. 15,17,19,[21][22][23]25,26,28,30,31 Four studies revealed that African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to receive no analgesia for pain 15,17,19,28 even after adjusting for potential confounders 15,17,19 and in the setting of similar pain complaints. 19,28 Moreover, African Americans 21,23,25,30 and Hispanics 21,22,30 were reported to receive significantly less opioid analgesia compared to whites, even after adjusting for other fac-tors. 22,30 In addition, 2 studies revealed that nonwhite patients, particularly Hispanics, were less likely to receive Cox-2 selective anti-inflammatory agents compared to whites. 26,31 Of 7 studies with more than 1000 subjects, 6 revealed disparities in analgesic prescription patterns by patient race or ethnicity. The lone study that revealed no difference in analgesic prescription was the one study focusing on children with long-bone fractures. 29 We identified three studies that examined whether patient race and ethnicity had an impact on pain-related outcomes. [32][33][34] These studies measured pain treatment outcomes using Pain Management Index (PMI) scores, which compare analgesic therapy received for the level of pain severity reported to World Health Organization guidelines for pain management. [32][33][34] A seminal journal article by Cleeland and colleagues 32 used this index to report that African American and Hispanic patients with cancer were more likely to receive inadequate analgesia compared to whites. Moreover, patients with cancer seen at centers that predominantly treat minorities are more likely to receive inadequate analgesia compared to those seen at centers treating predomi- The available data indicate that there are differences in pain treatment based on the patient's racial and ethnic background, and these differences cross different types of health facilities and treatment settings.\nTwo of the eight studies found disparities that could not be attributed to race or ethnicity.\nThese studies were limited by small sample size, unreliability of recorded information, and the potential for misclassification bias by race and ethnicity. Hispanics less likely than whites and African Americans to consult a health care professional (79% vs. 93% vs. 94%) and primary care provider (70% vs. 84% vs. 85%).\nWhites more likely to say that health care providers able to treat pain were accessible. African Americans more likely to express concerns about racial discrimination. Hispanics more likely to express concerns about finances, addiction and adverse effects of pain medication, and that doctors do not believe or understand their pain; Hispanics more hesitant to discuss pain with doctors.

We found one systematic review of the literature including nine studies (all included in this review as references 15-19, 22, 23, 27, and 33) describing the experience of current analgesic practice by patients from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. 13 Reasons for these disparities have been explored in several studies. These studies surveyed physicians, pharmacies, and patients to elucidate potential barriers to adequate pain management. Two surveys of practicing physicians using clinical vignettes found that patient race/ethnicity had no effect on physicians' decisions to prescribe opioids for pain management. 35,36 Conversely, two cross-sectional surveys of pharmacies conducted in New York City and in Michigan addressed the availability of opioids and found that pharmacies located in areas with fewer white residents were less likely to be adequately stocked with opioid analgesics. 37,38 In the Michigan pharmacy survey, the difference remained after controlling for zip code level variables such as resident age, level of urbanization, and presence of a hospital. 38 In the New York City survey, the disparity remained even after controlling for neighborhood crime rates, income, education, and age. 37 We found eight studies examining patient knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding pain treatment. One study found that African Americans (42%), Hispanics (43%), and whites (45%) were equally likely to utilize standard health care (going to a doctor, hospital, or other medical provider) to reduce pain. 39 However, other studies revealed that white patients identified fewer barriers to pain management than nonwhites, 40 that whites find providers able to treat pain accessible, 41 that they report less difficulty paying for health care and report fewer problems affording medical care, 42 and that they engage in self-help behaviors (e.g., use of over-the-counter medication or applying heat or ice) to reduce pain. 39 African Americans are more likely to express concerns about racial discrimination as a barrier to access to pain management, 41 to say that they should have been referred sooner for pain management although they were also more likely to wait longer after the onset of pain to seek treatment and to use the emergency department for treatment of pain. 42 While African Americans report that pain medication is helpful, 43 they are also likely to use prayer or spiritual coping for pain. 39 Of the three ethnic groups, Hispanics are least likely to visit a physician or to use prescription medications for treatment of pain. 41,44 Concern about finances, about addiction and adverse effects of pain medications, and about doctors not believing or understanding their pain were listed by Hispanics as reasons for lower access/utilization. 41 Finally, minority patients with cancer-related pain reported that inadequate pain assessment, patient reluctance to report pain, and lack of staff time were perceived barriers to pain management. 14 Other barriers to pain management identified by Hispanic and African American patients are a belief in stoicism and concerns about possible addiction to opioid medications. 45 Interventions to improve pain management and reduce disparities in pain management practice by patient race or ethnicity have also been reported. One study evaluated the effect of pain education on reported pain intensity. Ninety-seven outpatients with cancer-related pain enrolled in a randomized clinical trial that compared culturally sensitive pain management education to usual care. Although the intervention did not affect patient self-reported quality of life, perceived pain control, or functional status, African American patients in the education arm reported a significant decrease in pain ratings from baseline compared to the control group (p \u03fd 0.01) during the first year of the study. This decrease was not maintained at subsequent assessments, and the authors concluded that more intense pain man-agement education might be required to achieve better results. 46 Silka and colleagues 47 examined the effect of adding a verbal pain scoring (VPS) scale to the vital sign assessment on analgesic administration to trauma patients. Following implementation of the VPS, 73% of the 150 consecutive patients studied had pain scores recorded. The percentage of whites with a recorded VPS who received analgesics was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-60%) compared to 40% (95% CI, 19%-61%) of white patients who did not have pain scores recorded. However, 56% (95% CI, 45%-63%) of nonwhites with recorded VPS received analgesics compared to 25% (95% CI, 6%-44%) of nonwhites without a recorded pain score. Recording of VPS, reporting severe pain, and having either a long-bone or pelvic fracture were the factors most associated with receiving analgesics in multivariate analyses; patient race was not. 47 Although encouraging, the results of this study should be viewed cautiously given the small number of patients enrolled and the fact that the study was observational and did not include a table comparing the characteristics of patients with recorded pain scores to those without recorded scores. No studies were found evaluating whether the effect of patient race and ethnicity on pain assessment and management is modified by hospice or palliative care.", "n_publication_ref": 112, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The majority of studies to date have shown marked disparities in access to and use of effective pain treatment across racial and ethnic groups. African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to have their pain underestimated by providers, less likely to receive opioid analgesics, and more likely to have their pain undertreated or untreated compared to white patients. Differences in analgesic prescription patterns by patient race or ethnicity were identified consistently through time, in different patient populations, and across care settings including emergency departments, post-operative care, ambulatory care, and nursing homes. A few studies found that minority patients appear to seek and receive medical treatment for pain as often as white patients. However, minority patients encounter more barriers to adequate treatment.\nWhat are the reasons for these disparities? Studies have revealed provider-related, system-related, and patient-related reasons. Providers were surveyed in two studies that demonstrated no differences in pain treatment decisions by patient race or ethnicity using vignettes suggesting that patient race and ethnicity by themselves do not affect physicians' pain treatment decisions. 35,36 However, it is unclear whether these providers would make the same decisions when faced with similar patients in real life. Some investigators have suggested that physician concerns about the potential for substance abuse or other secondary gain by minorities could be contributing to inadequate prescribing of analgesics to minority patients. 33,35 However, to our knowledge no studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis. Moreover, the available evidence indicates that patients from minority racial or ethnic groups are not more likely to misuse prescription medications. In preliminary analyses of OxyContin abuse, Cicero and colleagues 48 report that over 91% of those who abuse this medication classified themselves as Caucasian. In a national survey of college students, McCabe and colleagues 49 reported that compared to whites, African Americans and Asians were less likely to engage in nonmedical use of prescription opioids over the previous year (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for African Americans 0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.66; adjusted OR for Asians 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.44); and Hispanics were less likely to engage in nonmedical use of prescription opioids compared to non-Hispanics (adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.80).\nWe do not know whether provider race or ethnicity affects analgesic prescription patterns or whether racial and ethnic concordance between providers and patients modulates the disparities seen in prescription patterns. Bartfield and colleagues found that physician pain score estimates were more predictive of analgesic prescription than patient race or ethnicity. 27 Therefore, the findings that minority patients have their pain underestimated by providers, 14 that minorities are less likely to have a recorded pain score, 15 and that Hispanics report that physicians do not seem to believe or understand their pain, 41 underscore the importance of inadequate pain assessment among minority patients as a significant provider-related barrier to effective pain treatment.\nSystem-related barriers to effective pain treatment have received little attention in research, but studies suggest these factors significantly affect minority patients' access to adequate analgesia. Minority patients were less likely to report find-", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PAIN AND ETHNICITY IN THE UNITED STATES 1469", "text": "ing pain specialists available to them compared to whites. 41 Pharmacies located in minority neighborhoods are more likely to have inadequate opioid stocks, 37,38 and patients treated in predominantly minority clinics are more likely to be undertreated for pain. 42 Morrison and colleagues 37 found that major reasons why pharmacies do not carry adequate opioid supplies, aside from low demand, were the additional paperwork required, regulatory oversights and monitoring, and the fear of penalties imposed by state and federal drug-enforcement agencies. However, it is unclear whether these regulations lead directly to disparities in access to pain treatment for minority patients. By contrast, patient-related barriers have been better studied. While access to pain treatment for African Americans seems to be affected by waiting longer than other groups to seek treatment and by primarily seeking care in emergency rooms, access for Hispanics appears to be more affected by financial constraints. 41 Both African Americans and Hispanics report a reluctance to complain of pain, 14 a belief in stoicism, 45 and concerns about possible opioid addiction. 45 Stoicism and reluctance to complain could explain, at least in part, the disparities seen in pain assessment. Concerns about the potential for substance abuse are widespread, even among physicians. These barriers would suggest that further education is needed in the use of opioids and the potential adverse effects of their use. Unfortunately, a patientdirected pain management education intervention was not sufficient to improve pain-related outcomes.\nThese results have several implications for clinical practice and for future research. Given that many minority patients expressed a belief in stoicism and a reluctance to complain about pain, efforts should be taken to ask every patient about pain or discomfort and to conduct a thorough assessment following an affirmative response. This may require asking more open-ended questions or using descriptors other than the word \"pain,\" such as \"discomfort,\" \"ache,\" or \"soreness,\" with which patients who are stoic may be more comfortable. Pain should be managed in every patient according to established guidelines, and the importance of disclosing pain sensation or feelings of discomfort should be reinforced at each and every visit. Quality improvement initiatives that improve treatment of pain for all patients should decrease disparities by race or ethnicity as evi-denced by the study demonstrating a narrowing of the gap between whites and African Americans treated with opioids after instituting verbal pain scores systematically in the emergency room. Educational interventions for patients and providers should aim to improve communication between patients and providers regarding pain and its treatment as well as provide information regarding the potential for substance abuse, which was a concern to many minority patients. 41,45 The educational intervention studied by Anderson and colleagues 46 did not result in improved pain-related outcomes for African Americans, but this intervention consisted of administering culture-specific videos and booklets on pain management. In a separate study, Anderson 45 reported that minority patients with cancer considered their physicians to be the \"most frequent and most trusted source of information about cancer and cancer-related pain. The intervention might have been more effective if patients had received the information directly from their physicians perhaps decreasing their reluctance to complain of pain and increasing the probability that their pain would be more adequately managed.\nThe patient-clinician relationship is key to providing effective pain management and care. Therefore, patients should be encouraged to seek care for chronic pain from ambulatory care practices rather than emergency rooms whenever possible, and those who present to emergency rooms should be given an appointment for outpatient follow-up along with enough medication to address the pain until the date of the appointment. Lack of insurance coverage may be a barrier to this strategy as well as to the patient even filling the prescription for pain medication. In such cases, prescriptions should be made for less expensive medications such as nonsteroidals for lower intensity pain, morphine for higher intensity pain in an opioid-na\u00efve patient, and methadone for higher intensity pain in an opioid-experienced patient.\nThere is a need for initiatives aimed to educate providers about pain assessment and treatment strategies including the effective use of nonopioid, nonpharmacologic, or other adjunctive therapy for pain management. To evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives, there is a need for studies determining outcomes of pain treatment based on patient report of treatment effectiveness and objectively observed outcome measures such", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CINTRON AND MORRISON 1470", "text": "as level of disability. Regarding structural barriers, policy interventions could be aimed at easing paperwork demands and security concerns for pharmacies and providers. Yet, further research is needed to determine whether other health care system factors such as preferred medication lists or other third-party payer schemes lead to disparities in management of pain by patient race or ethnicity. No studies were found that evaluated the effect of patient race and ethnicity on pain assessment and management in the setting of hospice or palliative care. Such a study is important because any racial or ethnic disparities identified in these settings, where relief of pain and other symptoms is a fundamental goal, 4 could send a disturbing message about the status of racial and ethnic relations in the United States with regard to health care. If no racial or ethnic disparities in pain assessment and management are found in these settings, they could be used as models for the care that ought to be provided to all.\nWhile publication bias can be a problem with any systematic review of the literature, several of the studies describing racial and ethnic disparities in access to and utilization of pain treatment services involved analyses of large databases that likely represent the United States population as a whole. The available evidence is limited, but the majority of studies reveal racial and ethnic disparities in access to and use of effective pain treatment akin to disparities found in other medical services. While minority patients appear to seek usual medical care as often as whites for the purpose of treating pain, they also encounter barriers to obtaining adequate pain treatment. Patientrelated, provider-related, and pharmacy-related barriers to pain management have been identified. However, no studies were found specifically addressing how other structures of care, such as hospital characteristics and patient insurance coverage, affect pain-related outcomes among patients from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Strategies must be developed that use facilitators to overcome barriers to palliative care while respecting cultural differences across racial and ethnic groups.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Quality end-of-life care: Patients' perspectives", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1999", "authors": "P A Singer; D K Martin; M Kelner"}, {"title": "Factors considered important at the end of life by patients, family, physicians, and other care providers", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2000", "authors": "K E Steinhauser; N A Christakis; E C Clipp; M Mcneilly; L Mcintyre; J A Tulsky"}, {"title": "In search of a good death: observations of patients, families, and providers", "journal": "Ann Intern Med", "year": "2000", "authors": "K E Steinhauser; E C Clipp; M Mcneilly; N A Christakis; L M Mcintyre; J A Tulsky"}, {"title": "Palliative care", "journal": "N Engl J Med", "year": "2004", "authors": "R S Morrison; D E Meier"}, {"title": "The impact of postoperative pain on outcomes following hip fracture", "journal": "Pain", "year": "2003", "authors": "R S Morrison; J Magaziner; M A Mclaughlin; G Orosz; S B Silberzweig; K J Koval; A L Siu"}, {"title": "Predicting discharge outcome after elective hip and knee arthroplasty", "journal": "AmJ Phys Med Rehabil", "year": "1995", "authors": "M C Munin; C K Kwoh; N Glynn; L Crossett; H E Rubash"}, {"title": "Cognitive status and postoperative pain: Older adults", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "1994", "authors": "W Duggleby; J Lander"}, {"title": "The impact of postoperative pain on the development of postoperative delirium", "journal": "Anesth Analg", "year": "1998", "authors": "E P Lynch; M A Lazor; J E Gellis; J Orav; L Goldman; E R Marcantonio"}, {"title": "A comparison of pain and its treatment in advanced dementia and congnitively intact patients with hip fracture", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2000", "authors": "R S Morrison; A L Siu"}, {"title": "Improving End-of-Life Care", "journal": "J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother", "year": "2004", "authors": ""}, {"title": "", "journal": "Pain", "year": "2001", "authors": "C L Edwards; R B Fillingim; F: Keefe;  Race"}, {"title": "The unequal burden of pain: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in pain", "journal": "Pain Med", "year": "2003", "authors": "C R Green; Anderson Ko; T A Baker; L C Campbell; S Decker; R B Fillingim; D A Kaloukalani; K E Lasch; C Myers; R C Tait; K H Todd; A H Vallerand"}, {"title": "Bonham VL: Race, ethnicity, and pain treatment: striving to understand the causes and solutions to the disparities in pain treatment", "journal": "J Law Med Ethics", "year": "2001", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Minority cancer patients and their providers: pain management attitudes and practice", "journal": "Cancer", "year": "2000", "authors": "Anderson Ko; T R Mendoza; V Valero; S P Richman; C Russell; J Hurley; C Deleon; P Washington; G Palos; R Payne; C S Cleeland"}, {"title": "Management of pain in elderly patients with cancer", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1998", "authors": "R Bernabei; G Gambassi; K Lapane; F Landi; C Gatsonis; L Dunlop R.

African Americans are twice as likely to die of serious illnesses such as cancer as are their white counterparts. 2,3 Eliminating disparities in health care and ensuring that the health care delivery system is responsive to minority groups is a national priority. 1 A main concern is care at the end of life.\nIt has been documented that race influences attitudes toward advance care directives and preference for end-of-life decision making. 4 Given the historical experiences of African Americans with the United States health care system, 5 it is important to understand what helps to shape the attitudes that result in the underuse of palliative care and requests for life-sustaining treatment at the end of life. For patients who do not perceive that they have had a \"good life,\" it may be challenging to convince them that there are tools available to help them have a \"good death.\"\nNumerous factors shape the experience of dying, many of which can be managed adequately and improved by health care professionals. Although advance care planning, ethical principles of autonomy, and informed consent support the use of advance directives, care for African American patients, in particular, remains inadequate, 5,6 deficient with regard to the provision of palliation and hospice referrals 7,8 and devoid of advance directives. 9 The purpose of the pilot research described in this article was to identify key factors that influence the completion of advance directives among African Americans. Faith-based organizations and community agencies collaborated to conduct a small study to promote advance-care planning. The descriptive objective of the analysis was well suited to the focus group design and to the qualitative analysis performed.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Advance care planning is a process in which competent adults articulate what and how they would like medical decisions to be made about their care in the event that they become unable to make the decisions themselves. Advance directives are the means through which people can choose options or communicate their wishes. 10 As Waters 11 pointed out, advance directives allow patients to retain some degree of control over treatments they might receive in medical settings if they are no longer competent to express their wishes. In a study of end-of-life directives among African Americans, Waters found that African Americans were less likely than whites to know about advance directives and that even those who did know about advance directives were less likely to complete them.\nCarlis and colleagues 12 examined the influence of ethnicity and race on attitudes toward advance directives and found that African Americans were less likely than other ethnic groups to communicate their health care wishes to health care practitioners. In addition, they were more likely than whites not to trust medical professionals to honor their treatment preferences.\nHowever, advance care planning may help to improve end-of-life care for African Americans. Previous studies have indicated that advance care planning is the mechanism for ensuring a \"good death\"-a death that is consistent with patients' preferences, such as freedom from pain and sparing loved ones from being faced with difficult de-cisions. [13][14][15][16] The communication that occurs between patient and health care practitioner during the planning allows the patient to specify his or her values and cultural beliefs, which may help the practitioner provide end-of-life care that is congruent with the individual patient's wishes. 17 Practitioners who facilitate advance care planning routinely conduct an assessment of patients' understanding of their medical history, condition, and prognosis and attempt to determine the patients' values, preferences; and personal, family, and community resources. Ultimately, the goal is to encourage patients to prepare for events that may occur as a result of a chronic or lifethreatening illness. Completion of an advance directive is one component of advance care planning-a process intended to help patients identify and articulate their individual wishes concerning medical treatment in the event they become incapacitated and cannot express their wishes directly. 18 A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that African Americans experience barriers to palliative and end-of-life care. 9,17,[19][20][21][22] Cultural issues and values regarding health care, spirituality, and lack of trust in the health care system are among the barriers that influence African Americans' participation in advance care planning. Moreover, when barriers to advance care planning exist, patients who have not participated in such planning may be at greater risk for experiencing aggressive life-sustaining interventions when faced with a terminal illness. 9,23 The factors that influence the decision of older African Americans to participate in advance care planning and to complete an advance directive are unclear.\nThe medical literature suggests that race influences treatment outcomes for patients at the end of life. Tulsky and colleagues 24 conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of racially diverse patients who died in hospitals in three geographic regions in the United States and found that African American patients were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units than were White patients and were significantly less likely to have Do Not Resuscitate orders written during the first week of hospitalization (37% versus 66%, p \u03ed 0.0001). Several other studies have documented that African American patients tend to receive more cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and tube feeding at the end of life than do white patients. 22,[25][26][27][28] ", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BULLOCK 184", "text": "The authors of these studies concluded that these patients may receive these expensive, aggressive interventions when they are unlikely to provide any long-term benefits. Mebane and colleagues 4 used a self-administered questionnaire to explore the preferences for end-of-life care in a racially mixed group of individuals and found that 58% of the white respondents agreed with the statement that tube feeding of terminally ill patients would be \"undesirable,\" whereas only 28% of the African American respondents agreed with it. Other research suggests that African American patients have a negative view of hospice and palliative care and place a higher value on longevity than white patients do. 12,19,29 Although advance care planning may improve the quality of care that patients are likely to receive at the end of life, information about the factors that influence African Americans' participation in advance care planning is inadequate. Thus, the present research was designed to promote advance care planning through education and assistance, culminating with completion of an advance directive.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A FAITH-BASED PROMOTION MODEL", "text": "The role of churches in community medicine and promotion of health within communities of color is well documented. [30][31][32][33] Most commonly, the churches engage in large-scale efforts to improve the health of their members through education, screening, referral, treatment, and group support. Although the notion that older adults can derive significant benefit from activities that promote health and prevent disease has been advanced in the medical literature, 34,35 research shows that despite this recognition, physicians seldom use community health-promotion measures that incorporate informal support systems. 36 Furthermore, informal networks may be particularly influential among patients of color who need palliative-care services. 21 In African American communities, the church has long been a resource for empowerment, mutual aid, and social change 33,37 and therefore may be able to encourage older members of the community to think about end-of-life decisions and take the steps necessary in advance care planning. Because of its prominent position and its ability to provide compassion and \"healing,\" the church has fostered involvement of members of the com-munity in physical 31,38 and mental health practices. 39 Customarily, older African American women look to the church for emotional, spiritual, and other tangible support. 40 Older African Americans are most likely to rely on members of their social support network for confirmation of their need for a variety of \"health-seeking\" activities that do not depend on the participation of a physician. 38,41 Several studies have documented the importance of culturally specific approaches to help seeking designed to improve the well-being of members of the African American community who might not seek services outside their own community. 31,37,42,43 The church has proved to be a viable mechanism not only for educating the African American community but for gaining credibility and authenticity in the community as well. 33 Furthermore, Levin 31 described the African American church as a healing resource for its members, offering a sense of belonging, mutual support, and a place to share feelings.\nThe faith-based promotion model has typically been applied to preventive health activities-the sense of collectivism, cohesiveness, group identification, and trust 44 that help to make the model an effective approach to bringing about changes in attitudes and behaviors regarding health. The model also may be a useful mechanism for informing African Americans about advance care planning.

To promote the program in the community, she and two research assistants met with community leaders and church officials to explain the need to target African Americans. Before the program was implemented, the meetings took place as needed to encourage participation. Most often, the meetings occurred between the principal investigator and a church leader, typically the pastor. Three churches requested multiple visits from the principal investigator as a way of developing rapport, a step that created partnerships between the research team and the target communities. The principal investigator made public appearances at various churches and met with church officials to discuss recruitment for the project. She was granted permission to approach community residents directly during church services and events to promote the program. African Americans were recruited with the help of the churches, parishioners, and community leaders. Of the 15 African American churches asked to participate, all agreed to publicize and host the advance care planning programs. Flyers announcing the church-sponsored program were posted throughout predominantly African American towns and meeting places, and community and church leaders distributed the flyers and publicized the program through word of mouth. In addition, 11 churches publicized the program in their worship service bulletins.\nAlthough 15 churches initially agreed to advertise and host the program, 2 churches later expressed interest in combining the sessions. Another 2 churches did not have enough interested members to convene the focus group and, because of transportation problems, chose not to collaborate with other churches to conduct the advance-care planning program. Thus, 12 advance care planning programs and focus groups were facilitated. TIY's Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects approved the study.\nOne hundred fifty people, including people in leadership roles in the churches, expressed interest in participating in the pilot study, either through a sign-up sheet or a telephone call. Among the individuals who initially expressed interest, 102 actually participated in the study (a rate of 68%). The criteria for inclusion in the study were self-identification as an older African American and the ability to speak and understand English. Interested individuals who met the selection criteria received a detailed explanation of the study and an informed consent form. A formal letter of invitation was subsequently mailed to participants reminding them of the purpose, date, time, and location of the church-sponsored educational forum. The letter described the study, included a confidentiality statement, and listed the researcher's telephone number. The week of the advance care planning program, participants received either a telephone reminder or a home visit if they had no telephone.\nThe participants were interviewed between September1999 and December 2001.

The data on health included self-rated health status 45 and the presence or absence of the following diseases strongly associated with disability and death among older people: heart disease, injury, lung disease, and stroke. 46 A research assistant was available to assist participants who could not read or write well enough to answer the interview questions.

They were shown samples of advance directives, such as a living will, a health care proxy, and a durable power of attorney form and were given the opportunity to ask questions related to the process and procedures involved in completing these forms. This approach is consistent with techniques used to generate organized discussions among participants in a relaxed, nonthreatening environment for the purpose of data collection. 48 This methodology is ideally suited to elicit participants' responses and experiences in their own words and has become increasingly accepted as an appropriate approach to exploring issues related to illness and communication. 49 In the present study, 12 groups of 8 to 10 people each were convened over a 2-year period. The purpose of the focus groups was to gather qualitative data about the participants' views and perspectives as older African Americans. Given the study's exploratory nature, failing to capture the participants' experiences in their own words could lead to premature and inaccurate findings.\nThroughout the data collection phase of all session, the principal investigator made every effort to adhere to the standard interview guide she had developed after reviewing the literature in this area. The guide contained questions about the following: preference for care at the end of life, desire to make personal choices, factors influencing preferences and attitudes, and beliefs about death and dying in addition to specific questions about the benefits of having an advance directive. For example, each focus group began with a general question concerning the advance directives, \"Now that you have been told what an advance directive is and how it is meant to help people, how beneficial do you think this can be to you or your family members?\" This question elicited data on the respondents' attitudes toward advance directives. A follow-up question was, \"Now that you have been told what an advance directive is and how it can be used, how likely are you to use an advance directive in the future?\" Then, participants were asked the following question about a \"good death\": There is something called a \"good death,\" which often means the person does not rely on breathing machines and other medical treatments to stay alive. It includes pain management or drugs that help the patient to not hurt so much, as well as other care that focuses on keeping the patient comfortable while allowing death to take its natural course. Through hospice and palliative care, patients receive this attention when they are near the end of life.

A person can come out of a coma. I've seen it happen, and I don't want the doctors to say \"Pull the plug because she's gone.\"\nThe doctor doesn't really know when someone is going to die.

I don't think having a piece of paper that says feed me if I am not able to tell you that I'm hungry, will make people respect your wishes.

She was so sad. When the doctors decided they could do no more for her, they sent her to hospice. Every time I went there to visit her, one of the nurses would tell me how many more days she had to live.

Wouldn't they just do that for everybody? I don't understand why somebody wouldn't want the doctors to do everything they can to save their life.\"\nSeventy-nine percent of the participants' strongest agreement about death and dying was related to the belief that it is acceptable to receive life-sustaining intervention because God will decide if and when you should die.

For example, faith and spirituality not only help individuals and families deal with the delivery of bad news but also are relevant factors when making decisions about whether to continue or withdraw life supports.\nThe participants' perceptions with regard to suffering and relief of pain also were influential factors in decision making. Although their views of suffering differed from the those described in much of the literature, their views were consistent with those reported by Black and Rubinstein, 55 who reported what seemed to be, \"a visceral awareness of the self's vulnerability to be broken or diminished\" at times.\nFor the African Americans in the present study, mechanical life support and prolongation of life did not necessarily indicate suffering. This finding emphasizes the point that the individual patient, not necessarily the professional providing the care, should define suffering. According to what the participants said, completing an advance directive and communicating one's wishes regarding the end of life would be culturally incongruent because death and dying are not to be discussed in terms of planning and anticipating what one would desire in the face of physical and mental incapacity. After all, \"only God knows\" when death is imminent. However, people who adhere to such beliefs say that family, friends, and others should be allowed to participate in their care at the end of life.

In addition, the obfuscatory language commonly used in verbal and written communication about advance care planning makes advance directives undesirable for people who believe the lack of clarity could result in even greater disparities in the medical attention they receive. Last, the finding that the participants did not believe that health care providers would honor and respect an advance directive was paramount. In the words of an extremely vocal community leader, \"As a black man, I am subject to receive less care and attention than a white man, and if I had a living will, they might not care for me at all.\"\nAdvance directives are a means by which patients can proactively determine their future care. However, they are not intended to take the place of ongoing discussions between health care providers and patients and families regarding patients' wishes concerning end-of-life care.\nBecause delayed or inadequate planning may have negative consequences for health care providers as well as patients and families, proponents of advance care planning have advocated the dissemination of information as a way of educating people and increasing the prevalence of advance directives. [56][57][58] However, although dissemination of information may be necessary to ensure that people are aware of their right to self-determination regarding their care, it may not produce a significant change in their behavior and attitudes concerning end-of-life decisions.\nThe African American participants in the present study expressed cultural values, such as not giving up hope, enduring suffering, believing in a \"higher power,\" and not planning for the \"unknown.\" Their underlying beliefs about the health care system and the racism and discrimination they had experienced over a lifetime permeated their cultural beliefs and values and became part of their frame of reference for decision-making about end-of-life care. 29 When informed that health care providers were working to ensure that everyone experiences a \"good death\" at the end of life, the participants reflected on how they had been treated by the white establishment over a lifetime and concluded that they could not trust that there would be parity in a good death.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "BULLOCK 192", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Disappointing results", "text": "Given the narrative data obtained from these older African Americans, the fact that the program resulted in only a small percentage of the participants completing an advance directive is not surprising.

Because convincing the study participants that health care professionals would honor their advance directive was challenging, one intervention strategy might be a training module that includes African American caregivers who have witnessed a loved one's \"good death.\" In addition, more community-based outreach on the part of health service providers could focus on increasing awareness of end-of-life issues and trust in the community. Because African Americans culturally value informal support networks, health care professionals should be encouraged to involve community leaders, families, and friends in communication about advance care planning.\nFuture research is needed to explore hypotheses that have developed as a result of the pilot study. Because the findings indicate that many African Americans fear they will not receive adequate medical interventions, the prevalence of that fear should be quantified in a larger population. In addition, focus groups could provide insight into how fear influences decisions about end-of-life treatment. Finally, the degree to which informal support networks influence end-of-life decisions also warrants exploration.\nAlthough the study was limited to a small geographical area and the sample size was relatively small, the faith-based promotion model was a useful mechanism for disseminating information to an otherwise hard-to-reach population.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed ESAS and HADS data collected from three previous clinical trials conducted by our group. The diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety, and moderate/severe depression and/or anxiety made when patients scored 8 or more, and 11 or more in HADS questionnaire, respectively.

[8][9][10][11][12][13] Untreated depression leads to difficulties with physical symptom control, social withdrawal, and reduces qual-three clinical trials conducted by our group. In all cases patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's institutional review board approved this retrospective study.\nPatients who agreed to participate in the clinical trial underwent a number of assessments including HADS and ESAS. The assessments were conducted by one of three research nurses in the department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation Medicine.\nThe first study was conducted to determine whether long-term consumption of oral opioids by male survivors of cancer would lead to central hypogonadism and whether this hypogonadism was associated with symptoms of sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Patients (n \u03ed 48) underwent a number of assessments in order to determine the frequency of hypogonadism. 23,24 The second study was designed to characterize dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer (n \u03ed 69) with dyspnea referred to a palliative care program. 25 The third study was aimed to determine the degree of correlates between spirituality and internal locus of control in patients (n \u03ed 99) referred to a palliative care outpatient clinic for the first time.\nThe study surveyed patients about issues of spirituality (unpublished data). All patients admitted to these three studies had normal cognitive status and were able to complete a series of questionnaires lasting between 30 and 45 minutes. All patients had assessments of ESAS and HADS in addition to other assessments required by the trials. Patients were not offered therapeutic interventions as part of participation in these clinical trials.\nThe diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety was made when patients presented a score of 8 of 21 or more in the HADS questionnaire for depression and/or anxiety following the instrument developer's instruction. 26 The diagnoses of moderate and severe depression and/or anxiety were made when the HADS was 11 of 21 or more and 15 of 21 or more, respectively, according to the developer's recommendations. 26 In the analysis of the ESAS, depression and anxiety were considered present when the intensity of the symptom was 1 of 10 or more and moderate/severe when the symptom was 4 of 10 or more. This was done followed 0 to 10 intensity criteria used for symptoms such as pain 27 and fatigue. 28 ity of life. There are many antidepressants available with acceptable side effect profiles, and their use may be of benefit to terminally ill patients with depression, even in the last weeks of life. [12][13] In view of the high rate of missed psychiatric morbidity, several efforts have been made to develop self-report tools that would improve the accuracy of detection of depression and yet brief enough for routine administration to the medically ill. Their use is strengthened by ease of administration and scoring without extensive training, speed of completion by the patient, and ability to obtain a gross assessment before a direct interview.\nOne of the most frequently used tools is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 14 (HADS). It has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing anxiety and depression in medically ill patients. 15,16 It consists of 14 questions in 2 subscales for anxiety and depression. HADS has been used successfully in a number of different settings as a screening tool for depression and anxiety. However, because of its considerable length and relatively complex scoring, it is difficult to use HADS in the clinical setting, particularly in palliative care patients who also require assessment of many other symptoms such as fatigue, pain, delirium, etc. 17 The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System 18 (ESAS) is a concise palliative care assessment tool for multiple symptoms. It has been widely used in the clinical setting, [19][20][21] and has been validated for their use in patients with advanced cancer. 22 It consists of ten 0 to 10 self-report scales that evaluate a mix of psychological and physical symptoms, in addition to a global sense of well-being. The advantage of the ESAS is that it is easy to administer, requires minimal effort and concentration from the patient, and can be displayed on a graph in the chart. However, the anxiety and depression components of the ESAS have not been validated in the assessment of depression and anxiety.\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the screening performance of depression and anxiety measured by ESAS compared to that measured by HADS.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": "In this retrospective review we have analyzed data collected from patients who participated in", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ASSESSMENT 297", "text": "The screening performance of the ESAS was assessed using HADS as a gold standard.

Overall, these values are also representative of the severity of ESAS and HADS values observed in patients referred to a palliative care program. 18,22 According to the interpretation of HADS score, 0-7 is normal, 8-10 is mild, 11-14 is moderate, and 15-21 is severe. Mild, moderate, and severe depression was reported in 50 (23.1%), 24 (11.1%), and 5 (2.3%) patients, and mild, moderate and severe anxiety was reported in 63 (29.2%), 25 (11.6%), and 6 (2.8%) patients, respectively.\nTable 3 highlights the screening performance of ESAS for presence and moderate/severe depression and/or anxiety according to HADS.

All patients were referred to a palliative care team for the assessment and management of different symptom complexes. Our data regarding demographics and symptom distress is similar to the characteristics of patients normally referred to our outpatient palliative care services. 29,30 However, these patients are not completely representative of the ambulatory outpatient group because they had agreed to participate in a clinical trail. Therefore, it is possible that these patients had less physical and psychosocial distress. This is suggested by the low frequency of patients scoring as having severe depression (2%) and anxiety (3%). This frequency is lower as com-pared to other studies reported in the literature for patients with cancer. 31,32 Sensitivity measures how well a diagnostic test detects a target disorder when it is present, and specificity measures how often a diagnostic test is negative when the target disorder is not present. Given these definitions, cutoff scores are directly related to sensitivity and specificity, because a high cutoff score decreases sensitivity and increases specificity and a low cutoff score increases sensitivity and decreases specificity. The majority of researchers on depression in patients with cancer have used the HADS, with much of this research focused on identifying the optimal cutoff scores for depressed patients with cancer. [33][34][35][36] Unfortunately, the cutoff score has often varied in different studies. [37][38][39] There is variability in the sensitivity and specificity that may be attributed to differences in validation measures, sample studied, or other particular issues of each study. 10,37 However, a recent review demonstrates this in 10 studies of patients with cancer. 38 Our data using a higher level of symptom intensity as a cutoff for the diagnosis of depression and anxiety suggests that the screening performance of the ESAS was poor, particularly with regard to sensitivity.\nAlthough the most commonly used screening tool is HADS, some studies suggest that because the major construct of the HADS is anhedonia, this can result in lower screening performance in  DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ASSESSMENT 301 patients with advanced cancer. 43 In addition to HADS, other measures have been used as well. Chochinov et al. 40 compared the performance of a single-item question of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), \"Have you had depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day?,\" the Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form, and a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) against a diagnostic interview adapted from the SADS. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the single-item interview was 1. However, because the question was derived from the gold standard interview, a positive response was required to be part of the diagnostic criteria. It was noted that the screening test was not independent of the gold standard, and the interviewer applying the \"test\" would not have been blinded to the gold standard results. Hence, this exceptionally good result should be considered preliminary. Despite these problems, a singleitem questionnaire has obvious advantages in palliative care populations. The study showed that the VAS sensitivity and specificity was 72% and 0.50 respectively, using a cutoff of less than 55 mm with lower scores indicating greater levels of depression. A recent prospective study 41 in 74 palliative care day unit patients, compared three screening tools using a semistructured clinical interview according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria as a gold standard. They used a 0-10 mood rating scale, a single-item question, \"Are you depressed,\" and the Edinburgh Depression Scale. The single question had a sensitivity of 55% and specificity 75%, the Edinburgh depression scale at a cutoff point of more than 13 had a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 80%, and mood 0 to 10 scale with a cutoff point of more than 3 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 43%.\nFrom a clinical perspective, our findings show that using a cutoff of 2 of 10 or more in the ESAS, a total of 123 of 216 patients (57%) screened positive for depression. Of these patients, 61 (50%) were confirmed to be depressed by the HADS (\u0546 8), and 62 (50%) were found to be false-positive. In addition, 18 of 93 patients (19%) who screened negative for depression by ESAS were found by the HADS to be depressed.\nOur results suggest that the ESAS should not be used as a diagnostic tool for depression or anxiety. Patients who score positive by this instrument should undergo a more comprehensive assessment following DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. In addition, because of the significant number of falsenegatives it is also important to conduct a comprehensive assessment in all patients who appear to present clinically depressed and/or anxiety even though they may score anxiety and/or depression as absent in a tool such as the ESAS. On the other hand, since the under diagnosis of mood disorders occurs in the majority of depressed cancer patients, [8][9][10][11][12][13] our results suggest that the ESAS can be used as a screening tool to allow for clinical improvement in the management of depression and anxiety in palliative care patients.\nOther tools specifically designed for psychiatric screening are likely to perform better than the ESAS in the screening of mood disorders. However, palliative care patients require careful assessment and management of multiple symptoms. This is demonstrated by the symptom profile observed by our group in this study (Table 2) and others. 18,29,42 The use of specific tools for the assessment of pain, fatigue, dyspnea, cachexia, mood disorders, and overall quality of life in the same patient is likely to become logistically difficult and overwhelming for the patient under these circumstances, the ESAS and other general symptom assessment tools offer a reasonable alternative for daily clinical care.\nWe conclude that values of more than 2 of 10 in the ESAS scale provide acceptable sensitivity for the diagnosis of depression (0.77) and anxiety (0.83) according to the HADS. Further research needs to be conducted for the appropriate definition of cut off values for severe depression and/or anxiety, and should attempt to establish the best performance tools for the screening of depression/anxiety in palliative care.", "n_publication_ref": 26, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Depression and suicide in patients with cancer", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "1994", "authors": "M J Massie; P Gagnon; J C Holland"}, {"title": "Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer", "journal": "J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr", "year": "2004", "authors": "M J Massie"}, {"title": "Depression in advanced disease: A systematic review Part 1.

This paper provides a descriptive review of the literature related to spirituality and health, with a special focus on spirituality within palliative and end-of-life care. CINAHL and MEDLINE were searched under the keywords \"spirituality\" and \"palliative.\" The review revealed five overarching themes in the general spirituality and health literature: (1) conceptual difficulties related to the term spirituality and proposed solutions; (2) the relationship between spirituality and religion; (3) the effects of spirituality on health; (4) the subjects enrolled in spirituality-related research; and (5) the provision of spiritual care. While the spirituality literature within palliative care shared these overarching characteristics of the broader spirituality and health literature, six specific thematic areas transpired: (1) general discussions of spirituality in palliative care; (2) the spiritual needs of palliative care patients; (3) the nature of hope in palliative care; (4) tools and therapies related to spirituality; (5) effects of religion in palliative care; and ( 6) spirituality and palliative care professionals. The literature as it relates to these themes is summarized in this review. Spirituality is emerging largely as a concept void of religion, an instrument to be utilized in improving or maintaining health and quality of life, and focussed predominantly on the \"self\" largely in the form of the patient. While representing an important beginning, the authors suggest that a more integral approach needs to be developed that elicits the experiential nature of spirituality that is shared by patients, family members, and health care professionals alike.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The epiphany of spirituality and health research T HE TOPIC OF SPIRITUALITY, in relation to health research, is one that has seen extensive scholarly interest over the last 20 years as is evident in the approximate 5000 citations when the word is entered into CINAHL or MEDLINE (Table 1), arguably the most recognized literature search tools in their respected disciplines. However, most of this literature is theoretical and opinion based, focusing on the conceptualization of a term that seems to escape attempts to confine it to a simple standard definition. 1(p31) This conceptual issue was a factor in this paper because the writers had to decide which terms to include in their literature search on spirituality. For example, should the literature review be broadened to include terms such as \"well-being,\" \"meaning,\" \"hope,\" \"religion,\" \"suffering,\" and \"belief,\" which while maybe not being intended to be correlated to spirituality by the original authors, arguably fall under the umbrella of spirituality?\nFurthermore, the increasing interest in spirituality within health care and the emerging research appears to be following several themes, although these have not been well articulated. One such theme appears to relate to researching the therapeutic use of spirituality and the effects of spirituality on health outcomes. Palliative care and end-of-life care seems to be driving much of this recent interest as it views the need to address the spiritual needs of terminally ill patients as one of the cornerstones of palliative care's mandate (Table 2). 2 This review attempts to systematize the spirituality and health literature within palliative care in order to provide a thematic framework that will identify the historical trends in the literature and in doing so, reveal current gaps which will guide future research. The literature reflects an understanding of spirituality that is void of religion, an instrument to be utilized in improving or maintaining health and quality of life, and is primarily focused on spirituality as it relates to the individual, namely the patient. While these thematic threads have proven necessary and beneficial, they provide a finite and somewhat skewed understanding of spirituality that is in need of expansion. While this review focuses on the spirituality literature within palliative care specifically, it begins with a discussion of spirituality and health research in general (Table 1). This review will first identify, articulate and critique the emerging themes related to the general spirituality and health literature in order to provide a framework from which a more detailed and informed discussion of the topic within palliative care specifically can ensue. Literature from the domains of theology and religious studies will be incorporated as appropriate.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "LITERATURE REVIEW METHODOLOGY AND SEARCH STRATEGY", "text": "Although the literature review was largely descriptive, with the aim of identifying emerging themes in the literature, a systematic approach was taken to identify the relevant literature. Two reference databases, MEDLINE (1966to April 2005 and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005) under the keywords \"spirituality\" and \"palliative.\"\nAll papers were individually assessed for relevance and quality by the principal author's doctoral committee, representing a range of professional and interdisciplinary perspectives. The total number of articles identified by this electronic online search was 101 (MEDLINE) and 135 (CINAHL). Many mentioned the term spirituality in passing. After sifting through these articles, gathering other articles that mentioned an aspect of spirituality but not the term itself (e.g., hope, meaning); conducting manual searches in bibliographies or referred by peers that were not located in the original literature search, 58 articles were deemed pertinent and discussed here in the thematic analysis.\nSix themes emerged within the palliative care literature: (1) general discussions of spirituality in palliative care 14 ; (2) spiritual needs of palliative care patients 23 ; (3) the nature of hope in palliative care 7 ; (4) tools and therapies related to spirituality 6 ; (5) effects of religion in palliative care 3 ; and (6) spirituality and palliative care professionals. 5 Themes were determined by the principal author and his doctoral committee representing a variety of disciplines, three of whom are experts in the field of palliative care. It should be noted that while these groupings were necessary, there were articles that overlapped and covered more than one of these themes.

While there was some interest in the topic of spirituality prior to 1990 within healthcare (see Table 1), the last fifteen years has witnessed a prolific increase of activity in the topic. One is compelled to ask the question-what is driving this surge in interest? What factors contribute to the centrality of the topic over the last 20 years within healthcare in contrast to its virtual absence prior to this period? Perhaps, such statistics simply parallel the evolution of qualitative research methods in these disciplines, providing researchers in the field with improved and more appropriate tools to empirically explore this rather ethereal topic, this was not however reflected in the literature. 3 Perhaps, it is evident of an effort to reintegrate, not only spirituality and health, 4,5(p554),6 but the sacred and the secular. 7,8 Some scholars suggest that the interest in spirituality was due to an evolution from what prior to 1970 was commonly termed \"religious care\" to the more encompassing term spiritual care 9(p5) ; this however was not reflected in the literature (see Table 4). What can be acknowledged with some degree of certainty is that spirituality based research, and spirituality in general, has become a very fashionable concept in Western society of late, contributing to a variety of different meanings. [10][11][12][13][14][15] A detailed reflection on what is driving the increase in spirituality-related literature and interest in general is outside the scope of this paper.", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Proposed solutions to the conceptual ambiguity of the term spirituality", "text": "The conceptual ambiguity of the term spirituality, while being filled with differences, is perhaps the single greatest point of unity in the literature, as researchers seemed to devote most of their discussion to the lack of a conceptual definition. Three possible approaches to defining the term spirituality seem to be emerging: (1) recognition that the concept does seem to evade language and should therefore be treated contextually; (2) a broad definition of spirituality being proposed that is somewhat ambiguous; and (3) a concise definition being proposed that is restrictive. Proponents of the first option, such as White, 13 Cawley, 1 Oldnall, 14 Narayanasamy, 15 echo the words of Byrne when she writes, \"The concept of spirituality does, however, appear to be resistant to language.\" 16(p67) Researchers, who situate themselves in this camp, inevitably suggest studying spirituality from a more qualitative perspective, arguing that because spirituality is to be experienced it cannot be measured. The words of McGrath embody the central thrust of this perspective, \"conceptually, spirituality cannot be understood as an independent entity to be measured and recorded. Researchers need to be open to the plethora of ways that individuals construct meaning. . . .\" 17(p183) A second response is to acknowledge the subjective nature of spirituality, but unlike advocates of the first position, to provide a broad definition that focuses on commonalities. Definitions range from broad summary statements such Ross's definition within nursing, \"[The spiritual dimension] has been regarded as the central artery which permeates, energises and enlivens the other dimensions of humankind\" 18(p37) to the listing of a SINCLAIR ET AL. 466 number of central themes that are presented as individual tenets. 19,20 One such example is Emblen's listing of eight key concepts of spirituality after reviewing thirty years of nursing literature:\n(1) personal, (2) life, (3) principle, (4) animator, (5) being (God), (6) quality, (7) relationship, (8) transcendent. 21 A central term that is used by researchers within this viewpoint is the term \"meaning,\" [22][23][24][25][26][27] which is a particular feature of the palliative care literature on the topic as will be discussed further below. [28][29][30][31][32][33][34] The final position seems to be indicative of two types of researchers: quantitative researchers and researchers who seem to have a strong personal faith. The former are influenced by the pressures to identify an operational definition that can then be quantified. 17(p182) Most of the spirituality and health studies reviewed by Larson et al. 35 emulated this position. Other examples include studies on the effects of prayer on cardiac patients and the effects of prayer on in vitro fertilization. 36,37 The latter group of researchers substitute strong beliefs for statistics and therefore either attempt to include the broader view of participants into their more restrictive definitions or they exclude participants' views on spirituality altogether. 14 ", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The relationship between spirituality and religion", "text": "A second feature of the health care literature on spirituality is discussion of the relationship between spirituality and religion. It is generally agreed upon within this literature that the term \"religion\" is correlated to an organized faith system, beliefs, worship, religious rituals, and relationship with a divine being. 5,35,[38][39][40][41] Emblen,21 for example in her literature search, sought to distinguish between the term spirituality and religion in the nursing literature, and concluded that religion is only one of many forms of spiritual expression. Markham, 42 however notes that the term spirituality itself is closely associated with the Christian religion and is at the very least expressed differently in other religions.\nWhile most researchers would agree that spirituality and religion are not synonymous terms, an essential issue in the literature is the nature of this relationship. While most researchers view the relationship as amicable, some researchers seem to reflect a desire to rescue spirituality from the confines of religion, whether that be in the form of a religious institution or a field within academia. 9,43 Kearney and Mount, 49(p359) in this vein state, \"Religion, on the other hand is a construct of human making that, for some, enables conceptualization and expression of spirituality.\" Walter, 44(p135) concluded his survey of this issue in palliative care, by stating that the majority of researchers in palliative care attempt to separate spirituality from religion, seeing \"religion as codified, institutionalized and relatively narrow expression of spirituality.\" While these writers would agree, that spirituality transcends and includes religion 45,46 and therefore assumes that all people are spiritual, 17(p182) caution does need to be exercised in distinguishing these concepts from one another. 10 This tendency is further evident in the title of book chapters such as \"From Religion to Spirituality\" 9 and terms such as \"human construct\" and \"restrictive,\" which connote a history of progress. The reason for concern is threefold; first, these views generally reflect a humanist perspective, 47 which while reflecting an unsecterian approach, would likely not coincide with the adherer's of religions who would reject labels such as \"human construct\" and the notion of moving from religion to spirituality. 48 Second, they reflect a Hegelian view of history, which places contemporary thought in a preferential position in relation to the history of the wisdom traditions. Finally, as Marty 12 suggests spirituality itself moves towards organization, developing from a nebulous movement into an organized and structured body of beliefs.\nThe field of religious studies provides us with some interesting feedback in regards to the relationship between spirituality and religion. Scholars have commented that the contemporary usage of the term \"spirituality\" is \"misty, evanescent, wispy and rich in appeal to narcissism\" 12(p439) and a term that everyone uses but nobody understands. 49 Regarding the apparent dichotomy between these two illusive terms, while some scholars have supported this divide, 50 there is increased evidence that these two concepts while being distinct are very much interdependent terms, 10 as reflected in the writer's previous research within an interdisciplinary palliative care team. 51 Marler and Hadaway 10 reviewed studies by Roof, 52 a U.S. national 1999 Gallup poll, 53 a \"Spirituality and Health\" poll conducted in 2000 by Scott, 54 and the Zinnbauer et al. 11 study of religious definitions. They discovered that many of the respondents to each of these studies saw themselves not in an either or fashion in relation to spirituality and religion, but in a both and man-", "n_publication_ref": 28, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SPIRITUALITY LITERATURE REVIEW 467", "text": "ner-being both religious and spiritual. Marler and Hadaway 10 therefore stress the importance of offering respondents of such surveys the choice of being both religious and spiritual as they discovered that a significant portion of respondents from each of these major studies saw themselves in this manner.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The effects of spirituality on health", "text": "A third theme of the health care research on spirituality is a focus on the effects of spirituality on various health outcomes. Studies have reported that spirituality and related aspects (e.g., prayer, meditation) have had a positive effect on: chronic pain [55][56][57] ; psoriasis in patients receiving phototherapy 58 ; patients' immune function 59 ; less adverse affects in cardiac patients 36 ; the success of in vitro fertilization 37 ; greater social support and fewer depressive symptoms among geriatric patients; 38 bereavement [60][61][62] ; increased physical and mental health [63][64][65] ; and various quality-of-life issues in palliative care that will be discussed in greater detail below. [66][67][68] Larson's seminal systematic review of over 300 spirituality and health studies 35,69 in which the correlation between spirituality, religion and health is argued, provides a comprehensive review of such research and epitomizes this functionalist approach. 11 Criticism of these findings are extensive and discussed comprehensively by Sloan et al. 6 and Freedman et al. 70 The central weakness is the failure to control for confounding variables, such as socioeconomic status, behavioural differences, age, physical mobility and social support. 6(p665) For example, Larson and colleagues 71,72 cite numerous studies that indicate a positive correlation between church attendance and life expectancy, and between church attendance and a decreased rate of suicide. 73 But as Sloan et al. 6 and Freedman et al. 70 note, many confounding factors were not accounted for; including the observation that people who attend church are generally healthy enough to attend versus people who are too sick to attend. A second criticism of studies on the effects of spirituality on health relate to sampling. Freedman et al., 70 analyzed all 329 peer-reviewed research studies cited by Larson 35 and discovered that the studies largely reflected the experiences of Caucasian (85% of the studies), American (73% of studies), Christian subjects (95% of respondents when mentioned) and cannot therefore be generalized. 70(p92) While the above mentioned studies seem more indicative of the relationship of religion and health, similar correlations have been made between spirituality and health. For example, Chiu et al. 74 in their survey of the spirituality literature in health care reported that 79.5% of the articles originated in the United States, with only 2.4% of articles originating from non-Western countries.\nOne final note that has not received much attention in the literature is the general utilitarian approach that underlies a lot of these studies exploring the effects of spirituality on health. 8,48,69 This consumeristic approach to spirituality often runs contra to the heart of the historical traditions that developed such practices, creating what could be termed a \"spiritualistic\" approach to spirituality. One recent text has begun to discuss this apparent contradiction within the Christian tradition, 48 arguing that while healing has always been a significant concern of Christianity, this interest occupies a limited place within the traditions' overarching concern for its members to faithfully participate in the entire scope of God's work toward all creation. 48(p7) The subjects of spirituality and health research A fourth theme of the spirituality and health research literature are the subjects of study-the patients themselves. While the research reflected a broad understanding of spirituality, ranging from self awareness to the relationship of self to \"Other,\" research was confined primarily to the relations of such concepts to the patient and did not address the role of spirituality in the lives of family members and health care professionals. For example, while health care professionals are called to care not only for patients, but their families, 2 the authors were hard pressed to find a journal article that studied the spiritual needs of patients' families. Within palliative care, Mc-Grath, 17 in her extensive discussion of the literature did not cite one study that dealt with this topic. Murray et al. 75 represented the only study that included carers in their study population, reporting that carers expressed unmet spiritual needs. If one considers including the bereavement literature in their search, there would be an expected increase in articles, but the idea that spiritual needs are only a reality post-mortem is a troubling understanding of health and is in stark contrast to this palliative care chaplain's clinical experience. Inferences to the importance of addressing the spiritual needs of family members can be taken from Cherlin et al. 76 study on family perceptions of clinicians' outstanding practices in end-of life care, which included nonabandonment, respect, and care for the family. The tendency to focus on the ill patient further perpetuates the notion of spirituality as simply another treatment method to be utilized for a positive health outcome. As Shuman and Meador note:\nReligion and medicine are, in contemporary North American culture, means of achieving desirable goods external to their practice; both are increasingly viewed as means for self-interested individuals to attain the nearly universally desirable commodity that is individual health. 48(p6) There was also a lack of research on the spirituality of caregivers themselves. It seems somewhat ironic that we, as caregivers, recognize the importance of holistic care for our patients (spiritual, psychological, social and physical), yet we do not see the importance in living out this philosophy personally as is evident in the lack of research on the topic. A very small number of studies, 13,[77][78][79][80] including the researchers' own study, 51 provided direct research into this area, along with a handful of other studies that referred to the relationship between spirituality and health care professionals indirectly. [81][82][83][84][85][86][87] The provision of spiritual care A final characteristic of the literature related to the provision of spiritual care, within the scopes of practice of various disciplines. This is supported in the literature as patients have identified a desire to have their spiritual needs addressed by various health professionals. 5,24,[88][89][90][91][92][93][94] Professionals in a variety of disciplines have made the case of the inclusion of spiritual care within the scope of their practice. 18,20,82 The discipline of psychiatry, for example, provides both direct discourses on the inclusion of spiritual care into their discipline, [95][96][97] along with others who seem to simply assume the place of addressing aspects of spirituality within psychiatry without feeling the need to provide justification. 98,99 While most authors advocate for spiritual care to be included in the scope of practice of their var-ious disciplines, what this care actually looks like in the various disciplines, particularly the nonchaplaincy related ones, is unclear. 79,100,101 It is not surprising that some concerns about role overlap have been expressed. Kelleher suggests that there appears to be \"a race to add spiritual care to the ambitions of certain clinical professions.\" 102(p175) This may reflect the same tensions that occur within interprofessional collaboration and multidisciplinary care. 103 The authors of this review argue that chaplaincy should not own the sole rights to providing this care but, apart from providing spiritual care for those patients with significant spiritual needs, have an important role to educate, guide and equip other disciplines with the skill sets to engage in this care. An interesting secondary feature of the discourse of specific disciplines regarding spirituality is the language they use. For example discussions of spirituality in the nursing literature predominantly speak of the spiritual \"dimension,\" 18,[104][105][106][107][108] which seems to reflect an underlying compartmentalization of the human make up, whereas psychiatry, as will be discussed below, frequently uses the terms \"meaning\" and \"therapy\" in their discussions. 28,66,98,109,110 This demonstrates how discussions about spirituality are affected by the discourse of the particular discipline that one is coming from.", "n_publication_ref": 87, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SPIRITUALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF PALLIATIVE CARE", "text": "The palliative care literature has provided a significant amount of articles on spirituality. A systematic review of spirituality and religion in three palliative care journals between 1990-1999, resulted in 155 articles being found, most of which were in the form of nonresearch-based discussions that indirectly mentioned the topic. 111 The present literature search began by utilizing CINAHL and MEDLINE under the keywords \"palliative\" and \"spirituality\" resulting in just over 100 articles being found, many of which only mentioned the term spirituality in passing. After sifting through these articles, gathering other articles that mentioned an aspect of spirituality but not the term itself (e.g., hope, meaning); and any other articles discovered in bibliographies or referred by peers that were not located in the original literature search but were deemed pertinent,  3 ; and (6) spirituality and palliative care professionals. 5 A summary of the literature is provided within these six themes.\nSPIRITUALITY", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "General discussions of spirituality and palliative care", "text": "The general articles 14 on spirituality and palliative care reflected three themes-historical background, the necessity of spiritual care, and discussion on definitions and distinctions between religion and spirituality. The person of Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the modern palliative care/hospice movement, was a central figure in the original discourses on spirituality. [112][113][114] Saunders, who originally came from an evangelical background, viewed hospice as a spiritual movement and a \"revolt against the disregard of the patient as a person\" evident in Western medicine in the 1960s. 114 O'Connor and Kaplan write: For Dame Cicely, spiritual care was not an 'optional extra'. So crucial was the integration of spiritual care into hospice work that she suggested that one method of evaluating the hospice experience in America would be to measure the level of the spiritual dimension being practiced in the delivery of terminal care. 115(p53) Walter 116 discussed the Christian roots of the hospice/palliative care movement and the importance of broadening the spiritual horizons, identifying three approaches to spiritual care that contemporary palliative care has taken: (1) religious; (2) ecclesiastical; and (3) spiritual. Walter 116 notes that the spiritual/meaning approach represents a growing trend and is a highly individualized perspective. Zimmermann and Rodin, 117 while not focussing on the history of palliative care specifically, provide interesting insight into the historical period in which these institutions developed. 117 According to them, the hospice movement was birthed under \"the denial of death thesis,\" a term sociologists used for the period between 1955-1985 in which the medical, psychological, and social science literature perpetuated the notion that Western society was a death-denying culture.\nThe other two categories in this grouping-the necessity of spiritual care and discussion on definitions and distinctions between religion and spirituality-paralleled the spirituality and health literature in general, focusing on the concept of spirituality and its importance to the field of palliative care. While the lack of conceptual consensus was an identified challenge in the palliative care literature, 118 half of the articles defined spirituality from what could be described as a humanist perspective focussing on the term \"meaning\" that in turn differentiated \"spirituality\" from \"religion.\" In focusing on \"meaning,\" this also resulted in spirituality being defined very individualistically, with minimal mention of \"other.\" 8,16,23,30,44,99,109,113,114,[119][120][121][122][123] The spiritual needs of palliative care patients\nThe majority of palliative care articles on the topic focussed on the spiritual needs of palliative care patients, three of which were overviews in the form of book chapters in major palliative care texts. 43,124,125 Surprisingly, only three studies asked patients directly to report on their spiritual needs, 75,110,126 however, one of these studies focused on a cancer population and not palliative care patients specifically. One book 127 sought to discover what palliative patients wanted, revealing many spiritual needs even though spirituality was not the specific focus of the text. Murray et al. 75 reported the need for love, meaning, purpose, and transcendence, while the Moadel et al. 110 study of 248 patients with cancer reported the need to overcome fears (51%); hope (42%); meaning in life (40%); finding spiritual resources (39%); and someone to talk to about: finding peace (43%); meaning of life (28%), death and dying (25%). Steinhauser et al. 126 identified eight items that were important factors in the dying process as identified by patients, bereaved family members, physicians and other care providers. While not specifically aimed at spiritual needs, some of these more general needs could be considered spiritual needs, such as: being mentally aware, making funeral arrangements, not being a burden, helping others, and coming to peace with God.\nOther articles reflected the opinion of health care professionals in regards to whether spiritual needs", "n_publication_ref": 35, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SINCLAIR ET AL. 470", "text": "were being met [128][129][130] the importance of maintaining meaning, control and/or dignity 28,43,67,131 ; addressing suffering/spiritual pain 33,43,112,124,125,129,132 ; reconciliation 124,130 ; listening, belonging and presence 43,85,93,127,129,130,[133][134][135] ; patient's concern about the future for self and family 124,133 ; and effects of religion on issues of psychosocial distress and requests for hastened death. 68,136 Additional themes that did not fit into any of the above categories included self-realization 27 and transcendence. 28,127 There were also three research studies that touched upon the spiritual needs of patients, that are here mentioned. Albaugh 137 utilized phenomenology and studied spirituality in individuals (n \u03ed 7) with a life-threatening illness, reporting that spirituality greatly affected patient's sense of meaning. Another study of 160 terminally ill patients identified spiritual well-being as the greatest factor in protecting against end-of-life despair. 29 Finally, Chochinov et al., 138 found that depression, anxiety, shortness of breath, and a sense of well-being were the main predictor variables of will to live in 585 palliative care patients.\nIn addition to the need to alleviate spiritual pain and issues of meaning, \"presence\" or \"being with\" patients in their suffering seemed to be a primary need according to patients themselves and as perceived by their health care providers. 139 When one considers the involvement of a health care professional in addressing spiritual pain and meaning, the centrality of palliative care professionals in providing spiritual healing seems to be all the more apparent. While these studies, were predominantly nonresearch-based discussions, focusing on many of the common themes of spirituality and health research in general (as noted above), there were also some differences. These included less of a focus on the affects of spirituality on physical health and more of a focus on maintaining aspects of spirituality, such as quality of life/well-being, rather than improving them.", "n_publication_ref": 36, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The nature of hope in palliative care", "text": "Hope and spirituality was frequently cross-referenced within the literature reviewed and for that reason was included in this review. Articles in which the cross-referencing was the main theme of the article, were included in the review, resulting in seven articles in the form of two research studies and five discussion papers. One research study, 140 involved factor analysis being conducted on two datasets in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in which the Beck Hopelessness Scale was used, revealing a superiority for a three-factor approach (two factor \u03e9 lack of motivation/control [factor 2]) versus a two-factor (optimism [factor 1] and pessimism [factor 3]) model. Correlational analysis revealed that measures of depression, spiritual well-being and suicidal ideation were the strongest correlates of all three factors. Finally, the authors noted that this three-factor preference may have some interesting clinical implications, including the possibility of helping patients maintain an optimistic view of the future (factor 1), despite experiencing a lack of control in ones life (factor 2), which palliative patients invariably are forced to deal with. Interestingly the highest correlate to suicidal ideation was not a lack of control (factor 2) as the authors expected, but a pessimistic view of the future (factor 3). One limitation of this study is that it did not measure hopelessness over time, an important issue when reporting on emotional factors in palliative populations as there are substantial temporal fluctuations. 138,141 Second, as is true of many studies of this nature, the study captured the content of hopelessness but did not provide insight regarding the mechanism of hopelessness. Buckley and Hearth 142 sought to understand the meaning of hope, to identify strategies patients use in maintaining hope and to track changes in hope over the dying trajectory by administering a Herth Hope Index (HHI) and a semistructured interview. The convenience sample, in which 15 of the 16 participants believed that their spirituality fostered hope, raised questions about the construct validity of the study and whether in fact it was about \"fostering\" hope or perhaps \"tapping\" into preexisting hope. The authors reported that the meaning of hope was associated with love for family and friends and that strategies for maintaining hope included being goal-focused and \"scaling-down\" hope over time.\nAdditional articles discussed the nature of hope, 143 noting that hope in palliative care is multidimensional (not a unidimensional hope for a cure), underresearched, and of therapeutic value. A similar article 101 also studied the nature of hope in palliative care noting that in this context hope should be viewed more as a process rather than a state to be obtained. Hegarty notes the importance of the health professional in this process, particularly in the way information is given, the SPIRITUALITY LITERATURE REVIEW time and space allowed for exploration and the assurance of continuing support. 101(p42) Hegarty, similar to Buckley and Hearth, 142 also noted the strong connection between hope and a person's belief system. One article 144 spoke of hope in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), drawing on the authors personal experience as an occupational therapist working with ALS patients and as a daughter of an ALS patient. This article, unlike previous articles, notes that in order for hope to occur one often goes through a process of hopelessness and denial. She suggests that in doing so ALS patients arrive at a far deeper understanding of hope, \"This is not hope for survival, but for something richer and more meaningful-a peaceful acceptance of life, and its inexplicable beginnings and endings.\" 144(p260) It is interesting, that in comparison with the discussions of palliative care professionals' reflections on hope, this personal account provides, what may very well be a more holistic understanding of hope and all of its suffixes (i.e., \"fullness\" and \"lessness\"). This is clinically congruent with the principal author's work as a chaplain, which includes the provision of spiritual care to ALS patients who often go through despair and find a greater sense of hope as a result. While hope is important, as noted above, this seems to suggest that it should not be rushed to too quickly, as this may circumvent the despair that often needs to be wrestled with before hope in its fullness can be experienced.\nOne article noted that, \"Spirituality instils hope that extends beyond the grave.\" 145(p1001) The final article, an editorial, 146 critiqued the literature on hope, identifying two interrelated problems: hope is not adequately defined conceptually and there is a recurring tendency to mistake hope's content (faith, meaning, etc.) for the mechanism of hope, noting that \"each could just as well be a final outcome of other phenomena, such as religious identification.\" 146(p229) Tools and therapies related to spirituality There were six articles that dealt with tools and formal therapies for use with palliative patients that incorporated an aspect of spirituality. One paper 147 reported initial efforts to validate-the Systems Belief Inventory (SBI), a tool designed to measure religious and spiritual beliefs and practices and the social support derived from a com-munity sharing those beliefs. While reporting that the SBI met tests of internal consistency, testretest reliability and convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity, there was confusion on the part of this reader as to how they separated the concept of spirituality and religion. In identifying that, 10 of the 15 items asked about religious rituals and practice and belief in a supreme being, while the remaining 5 items focused on support from one's religious or spiritual community; the confusion persisted. A second study set out to validate a measurement of \"a good death, 148 a term that has been used informally in palliative care for decades. 149 While the authors reported three factors that affected a good death (spiritual beliefs, control, and a belief that death was a relief to suffering) and reported acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability, the most striking limitation was the sample (n \u03ed 596) selected for the study, consisting of four cohorts: undergraduate medical students, master's degree nursing students, graduate students from the life sciences, and practicing hospice nurses. While these four cohorts provided interesting insight into this concept, one only wonders what the dying patients themselves would consider the greatest factors in \"a good death,\" especially because they are the ones who are actively dying. Further problems with this study and the concept of \"a good death\" were identified in an article entitled, \"Is there such a thing as a good death,\" 150 which provided a critical perspective on the concept. Walters, the author, draws attention to the dualistic nature of the concept and argues that \"struggle\" should be considered as an aspect of a good death based on the death of Jesus Christ. He writes, \"Ironic as it may seem, the death of Christ provides us with the ultimate anti-good-death story.\" 150(p407) Citing Walter, 151 Walters notes that the idea of a good death and palliative care in general find support in individualistic societies, a commonality that is shared with the concept of euthanasia. 150(p406) Chochinov provided a list of interventions aimed at \"the maintenance of dignity,\" 99(p2253) including a battery of questions that address this important aspect of patient's well-being. While Chochinov notes that further studies need to validate dignity-conserving care, his discussion of the topic concludes with the following words, stressing the importance of the caregiver as a person in the healing process. He writes,", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SINCLAIR ET AL. 472", "text": "Dignity-conserving care comprises not only what one does to patients, but how one sees patients. . . . When dying patients are seen, and know that they are seen, as being worthy of honour and esteem by those who care for them, dignity is more likely to be maintained. 99(p2259) Breitbart 109 discusses the need for spiritualitybased psychotherapy groups in helping patients with advanced cancer maintain meaning-a key in counteracting requests for hasten deaths. Breitbart anchors his work, as we discussed before, in the work of Victor Frankl and therefore defines spirituality in terms of \"meaning.\" Finally, Kissane et al. 123 propose the adoption of \"Demoralization syndrome\" as a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care. Demoralization syndrome is defined as \"a psychiatric state in which hopelessness, helplessness, meaninglessness, and existential distress are the core phenomena.\" 123(p13) The authors note that the syndrome can be differentiated from depression, although they call for further formal studies investigating the validity of such a diagnosis.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Effects of religion in palliative care", "text": "Three articles focused on the effects of religion on perceptions of death. The first study 152 found that strong religious conviction and belief in an afterlife were associated with less anxiety, death depression, and death distress. The sample consisted of 200 members of the general public, most of whom were undergraduate students and a handful of other individuals, including employees of the university. There was no mention of how these subjects were recruited. A second study, 153 on the reflections of relatives (n \u03ed 639) who's loved one had recently died, reported that acceptance of death was seen as more common among those who had a strong religious conviction, but was not related to belief in an afterlife. Because of confounding variables and the fact that these reports were based on relatives' perceptions, the author concluded that \"whether or not religion is a help around the time of death cannot be answered with any certainty.\" 153(p86) Yates et al. 154 used a questionnaire of religious variables (there was no mention of whether the tool had been validated), to yield data from 71 patients with advanced cancer. It was reported that religious belief had a \"substantial\" positive correlation to life satisfaction, while religious activity was significantly correlated to life satisfaction and happiness. Of the 36 patients who had since died, there was no correlation between religious variables and duration of survival. By way of limitations, these studies seemed to be plagued with the same problems as the general health and spirituality research mentioned above, including confounding variables and sample issues.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Spirituality and palliative care professionals", "text": "Only five articles dealt with the topic of spirituality and palliative care professionals directly, demonstrating the need for further research. O'Connor et al. 115 explored the spirituality of palliative care professionals in a small attitudinal study of present (n \u03ed 11) and past (n \u03ed 11) hospice workers, using a mail questionnaire. Past hospice workers had a strong religious educational background (64%) in comparison to the present workers (36%). Respondents also reported that spiritual care was something learned on the job, required time to become skilled in and while being viewed as a shared role, few participants agreed that all hospice staff should provide spiritual care (27%). It was also reported that patients made hospice workers more aware of spirituality (73%). Both groups (past and present workers) felt they understood their own spiritual needs (82% and 64%), and only 55% of respondents in both groups believed that there was an afterlife. While respondents were given an opportunity to provide feedback on religious education and their enjoyment of religious services (36% current, 91% past), they were not asked whether they considered themselves to be religious.\nMillison 80 interviewed eight caregivers who worked with the terminally ill, consisting of physicians (2) nurses (2) social workers (2) and clergy (2), all of whom who had been involved in a conference on hospice and Judaism. Unfortunately, this study did not describe a qualitative method and provided no discussion on the method of analysis. All eight participants reflected a strong connection between their own spirituality and the impact this had on their interactions with patients. The second overarching theme identified by Millison was that all the caregivers interviewed felt they received more \"spir-", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SPIRITUALITY LITERATURE REVIEW 473", "text": "itually\" from patients than they were able to give. Participants also spoke of the importance of vulnerability, honesty and humility in being present spiritually. Limitations of this study included lack of rigor, because no qualitative method was identified and no description of analysis was provided. Second, the sample was entirely Jewish and was recruited via convenience sampling, which while not necessarily being a weakness, was not reflected in the title of the article.\nA second study by the same author 79 studied the correlation between job satisfaction and spirituality in hospice directors (n \u03ed 120, 67% response rate) in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania through a mail questionnaire. 72% of respondents identified spirituality as a \"very important\" part of their lives, 91% of respondents indicated that spirituality was important or very important to hospice work and 97% felt it was important or very important to the hospice team in their program. Millison and colleagues argue that the findings seem to indicate that health care professionals choose hospice work in order to answer a spiritual calling, 79(p77) but in interviewing directors exclusively (96% who identified themselves with a religious affiliation), one wonders if this would be congruent with actual caregivers, since it would be expected that leaders in general would have a greater perception of their job as a calling. This factor would be expected to be higher in this sample since they were likely in hospice care for a long period of time. Since the sample solely consisted of hospice directors, who had less patient contact than frontline staff and may have been more akin to the spiritual lineage of the hospice movement, the results could not be generalized to hospice/palliative professionals as a whole. While, producing some interesting secondary findings, the relationship between job satisfaction and spirituality produced no statistically significant results.\nO'Connor and colleagues 31 reported findings of an ethnography on spirituality in palliative care, which combined a literature search on the topic and 13 individual interviews, 6 of whom were staff and 7 of whom were patients. In correlating the literature with the themes of the interviews, the researchers discovered two dominant themes: making the most of it now and making sense, defining spirituality as \"meaning making.\" The promising nature of this study unfortunately ended in the title as the authors used a form of ethnography that did not involve any participant observation, a hallmark of ethnography, and involved correlating interview themes with the literature. While literature reviews are important to qualitative researchers in formulating ideas of what research has been conducted prior to entering the field and are often included in the final write up, their usage as a tool in data analysis of an inductive method such as ethnography is a technique that these writers have never witnessed. 155,156 While confirming previous health and spirituality research, these findings could not rectify the inherent methodological issues, which made the study's utility severely limited.\nWhite 13 utilized cooperative inquiry to explore the concept of spirituality as understood by nine multidisciplinary professionals working at two cancer centers. White discovered that group members saw spirituality being expressed through the search for meaning or purpose and a sense of connection. There was also a sense among participants that spirituality affected the way in which care was given and involved tacit skills that were often hard to describe. A strong theme of the study was the positive effect experienced from participants as a result of participating in the study, many of whom reported an increased sense of confidence in their ability to provide spiritual care.\nThe literature that did attempt to move beyond attitudinal research predominantly focussed on how professional's spirituality impacted the setting. However, there was minimal attention given to how the setting impacted professional's own spirituality. Initial studies have reported the spiritual impact of working in palliative care, including hospice nurses having a stronger belief in the afterlife and a stronger sense of satisfaction in life and work than nonhospice nurses 87 ; a sense that spirituality became more meaningful among occupational therapists as a result of working in palliative care 82 ; and the belief that spirituality was a central experience in palliative care work according to an interdisciplinary palliative care team. 51 A focused inquiry of the effects of palliative care on professional's including exploration into potential spiritual challenges in hospice and palliative care is needed. 86,157 Finally, while palliative patients have expressed the importance of specific attributes of palliative care professionals that contribute to spiritual well-being, such as compassion, empathy, respect, self-awareness, nonabandonment,", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SINCLAIR ET AL. 474", "text": "and \"being present,\" 76,85,127,133 there has been a relative impoverishment of research on how professionals develop such tacit skills.

Spirituality, as a result of this intent analysis, has been reduced largely to a concept void of religion, an instrument to be utilized in improving health, and focused predominantly on the self largely in the form of the patient. While spirituality is uniquely understood and experienced by individuals, it is also a chord that can serve to bind humanity together. This collective component of spirituality has not been explored and is largely overshadowed by an individualistic approach that has failed to take into account the common threads that may bind patients, families, and health care professionals together through shared experience. While spirituality in palliative care is a central aspect of the discipline's history and takes on a different meaning than other areas of health care, these tendencies are still very much apparent, propagating a form of practice that reduces spirituality to simply another tool in our treatment repertoire, having been stripped of its mystery by empiricism, to be administered to the dying patient by the skilled practitioner. Furthermore, although spirituality is deemed to be an important component of palliative care by both professionals and patients, discussions have largely focused on conceptual and attitudinal issues, with little insight into the spiritual experiences of these individuals and how such \"spiritual\" attributes are cultivated. The literature also seems to assume that spirituality is a positive aspect of palliative care and health care in general. Finally, there is a void of qualitative research on spirituality and palliative care, particularly research investigating the actual palliative care setting.

Objective: The study's main purpose was to examine the association between religious coping and QOL among 170 patients with advanced cancer. Both positive religious coping (e.g., benevolent religious appraisals) and negative religious coping (e.g., anger at God) and multiple dimensions of QOL (physical, physical symptom, psychological, existential, and support) were studied. Design: Structured interviews were conducted with 170 patients recruited as part of an ongoing multi-institutional longitudinal evaluation of the prevalence of mental illness and patterns of mental health service utilization in advanced cancer patients and their primary informal caregivers. Measurements: Patients completed measures of QOL (McGill QOL questionnaire), religious coping (Brief Measure of Religious Coping [RCOPE] and Multidimensional Measure of Religion/Spirituality), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and sociodemographic variables. Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, lifetime history of depression and self-efficacy, greater use of positive religious coping was associated with better overall QOL as well as higher scores on the existential and support QOL dimensions. Greater use of positive religious coping was also related to more physical symptoms. In contrast, greater use of negative religious coping was related to poorer overall QOL and lower scores on the existential and psychological QOL dimensions. Conclusions: Findings show that religious coping plays an important role for the QOL of patients and the types of religious coping strategies used are related to better or poorer QOL.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "T HERE HAS BEEN GROWING RECOGNITION of the importance of asking patients in palliative care what matters to their quality of life (QOL), [1][2][3] rather than relying on the preferences of clinicians and family members. Accordingly, some of these studies have found that patients identify multiple dimensions that they perceive are important to their QOL. This includes the quality of their palliative care, relationships with family and friends, engagement in activities and hobbies, general outlook on life, and consideration of future issues related to their death. [1][2][3] For many patients who are confronting a life-threatening illness such as advanced cancer, religion and the use of religious coping becomes an important factor influencing their QOL. In fact, a review of studies on psychospiritual well-being among individuals with advanced cancer highlighted six themes through which religion/spirituality influenced well-being: self-awareness, coping and adjusting effectively with stress, relationships and connectedness with others, sense of faith, sense of empowerment, and confidence and living with meaning and hope. 4 Those living with terminal illness face multiple challenges that can impede their QOL. For instance, individuals with advanced cancer are required to cope with the physical and psychological impact of their treatment 5 as well as the impact that their illness can have on their family members. 6 Many patients living with terminal illnesses also have to deal with psychiatric problems, mainly anxiety and depression, 7,8 which can further complicate how they manage their illness. Consequently, the strategies that patients use to cope with these challenges can be important in predicting their QOL. 9,10 In several studies, religion has been consistently found to be an important coping resource for those with life threatening illnesses. 7,11,12 Religious coping can be particularly compelling for disenfranchised populations, such as the elderly, minorities, and women, 13,14 who often confront challenges in accessing health care. 15 More specifically, religious practices such as prayer and meditation can enhance a sense of control over stressful events 16 by helping individuals achieve a personal relationship with a higher entity that offers strength and support to cope with their illness. Furthermore, religion provides a sense of purpose and meaning for seemingly incompre-hensible events or chronic adversity. 17,18 Religious belief systems can provide a framework for understanding the experience of death and dying. 19 Religious resources may provide individuals with a terminal illness a sense of self-efficacy to accept their illness and manage problems associated with it more effectively. Self-efficacy has been posited by some 20 to be crucial to the psychological adjustment of individuals living with chronic illnesses.\nCross-sectional and longitudinal studies reveal that religious coping has been predictive of better mental health and physical health of individuals, after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic variables and nonreligious coping measures. 21,22 However, less attention has been paid to determining the type of religious coping, positive or negative, that may differentially affect health outcomes. Positive religious coping methods, such as prayer and benevolent religious appraisals of negative situations, reflect the perception of a secure relationship with God, a belief in a benevolent purpose to life, and a sense of connectedness with a religious community. In contrast, negative religious coping methods, such as attributions of situations to a punishing God and feelings of abandonment by God, reflect a struggle that grows out of a perception of a tenuous relationship with God, a more ominous view of life, and a sense of disconnectedness with a religious community. 23 Studies that distinguish positive from negative religious coping report that greater use of \"positive religious coping\" strategies is associated with improved mental health status, 24 stress-related growth, and spiritual growth. 25 Conversely, greater use of \"negative religious coping\" strategies is tied to more psychological distress [26][27][28] and increased risk of mortality. 29 Even though research has documented the significance of religion for patients with chronic and terminal illnesses, much of the focus has been on the positive dimension of religious coping. In light of the health risks associated with negative religious coping, it seems critical to examine the negative dimension as well. Furthermore, the influence of religious coping on the QOL of patients with terminal illness has, to our knowledge, never been examined comprehensively (i.e., included positive and negative dimensions). Moreover, the outcomes that have been typically measured in QOL research are limited to a few dimensions. 2 Given that patients perceive their", "n_publication_ref": 34, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELIGIOUS COPING AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER", "text": "QOL to comprise multiple dimensions, we used the McGill QOL questionnaire to examine how religious coping, both positive and negative, influenced multiple dimensions of QOL relevant to seriously ill individuals.

This report focused on the religious coping and QOL of the patients from the baseline evaluation; the caregiver experience is reported elsewhere. 32 Inclusion criteria for the study were: (1) diagnosis of advanced cancer (presence of distant metastasis and failure of firstline chemotherapy); (2) diagnosis at a participating site; (3) age 20 years or younger; (4) identified unpaid, informal caregiver; and (5) adequate stamina to complete the interview. Excluded were patient-caregiver dyads in which either the patient or the caregiver met criteria for dementia or delirium (by Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination) or could not speak English or Spanish. The participating centers were the Yale Cancer Center (Connecticut), the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System Comprehensive Cancer Clinics (Connecticut), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York), and the Parkland Hospital Palliative Care Service (Texas). Members of the oncology clinic staff at participating centers identified potentially eligible pa-tients who were then approached by trained research staff to ascertain interest in participation in the study. Interested patients and caregivers were contacted by telephone or a hospital room visit within the week to obtain informed consent. After receipt of the patients' informed consent, eligibility was confirmed through review of medical records and consultation with clinic staff.\nSeparate patient and caregiver interviews were then scheduled to occur in the hospital room, clinic, or home. Patients and caregivers each received $25 for completing the baseline interview.\nInterviewers from each site were trained by research staff at Yale University where they were required to achieve a high standard of accuracy and reliability based on concordance with the Yale Project Director's Rating of the SCID diagnoses (target \u03fe 0.85). Interview duration was an average of 45 minutes for patients. Patients who declined participation were asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding their reasons for refusal, amount of emotional and physical distress, and demographics.\nOf the 321 patients who were approached for participation from September 18, 2002 to April 8, 2004 and confirmed to be eligible, 116 (36%) declined participation.

Factor analysis of the 16-item scale 31 yielded 5 subdo-TARAKESHWAR ET AL. 648 mains: physical well-being (1 item), physical symptoms (3 items), psychological (4 items), existential (6 items), and support (2 items). Cronbach \u2423 of the subdomains ranged from 0.62 to 0.81 for those scales with more than a single item. Each item uses a 0-10 scale with anchors at each end. The item mean scores were summed to obtain a subdomain score; these subdomain mean scores were summed to obtain a total QOL score.\nThe items, anchors, and Cronbach \u2423 of the subdomains for this study are shown in Appendix A. The subdomains were scored such that higher scores reflected better QOL. The Cronbach \u2423 for the total scale was 0.88. Also, the five subdomains were significantly correlated with each other (r ranged from 0.18 to 0.58) with one exception: the support and physical symptom subdomains were not significantly associated with one another. Finally, all five subdomains were significantly associated with the total QOL score (r ranged from 0.41 to 0.82).\nReligious coping. Items from two scales, the Brief Measure of Religious Coping (RCOPE) 33 and the Multidimensional Measure of Religion/Spirituality (MMRS) 34 were used to assess the religious coping strategies used by the participants. Appendix A provides a list of the items. Positive religious coping was measured by seven items from the MMRS (e.g., I have been looking for a stronger connection with God) while negative religious coping was measured using seven items from the Brief RCOPE (e.g., I have been wondering whether God has abandoned me). Even though the Brief RCOPE had positive religious coping strategies, we did not use these items because many of them seemed to assess negative religious coping (e.g., I've been seeking help from God in letting go of my anger, I've been asking for forgiveness for my sins). Responses to the Brief RCOPE items ranged from 0 \u03ed not at all to 3 \u03ed a great deal while the MMRS item responses ranged from 0 \u03ed never or almost never to 6 \u03ed many times a day. Scores on the seven items for each scale were summed, with higher scores representing greater presence of the construct. In this study, the MMRS positive religious coping scale had an \u2423 of 0.97 while the \u2423 for the negative religious coping scale was 0.73. The two scales were not significantly associated with one another (r \u03ed 0.06).\nSelf-efficacy. The General Self-Efficacy Scale 35 was used to assess perceived self-efficacy re-quired to cope with daily hassles as well as adaptation to stressful life events (e.g., I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough; If I am in trouble I can usually think of a solution). Each item refers to successful coping and implies an internal-stable attribution of success. Responses on the 10-item scale range from 1 \u03ed not at all true to 4 \u03ed exactly true. All responses are summed to yield a total score; high scores suggest greater perceived self-efficacy.

Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that greater use of positive religious coping was related to better overall QOL, as well as better scores on the existential and support dimensions of QOL. Also, greater use of negative religious coping was associated with worse overall QOL, as well as lower scores on the psychological and existential dimensions of QOL. The one exception to our hypotheses was the finding that greater use of positive religious coping was also related to more physical symptoms. As these data are cross-sectional, conclusions about causality cannot be made in either direction. Thus, although it is likely that religious coping influences QOL in particular ways, it is equally possible that patients who experience better QOL also turn to religious resources for coping with their illness and other stressors. Perhaps patients who experienced greater physical symptoms turned to religion more often for strength, comfort, and guidance. Although the data in the current study are cross-sectional, a few longitudinal studies on religious coping have reported stability in its use. For instance, a study among medical rehabilitation patients that distinguished positive and negative religious coping 38 reported stable means on positive and negative religious coping between admission and follow-up. In another 2-year study among older, hospitalized men and women, 29 both positive and negative religious coping at baseline and follow-up were significantly correlated. Furthermore, qualitative studies among individuals who have experienced some form of trauma have found that the religiosity of many individuals often increases or deepens after the traumatic experience. [39][40][41] All of this suggests that the results of the current study, although crosssectional, may well hold for the future quality of life of patients with advanced cancer, especially for patients who endorse greater use of religious coping methods, although longitudinal research is needed before such conclusions may be drawn.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELIGIOUS COPING AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER 651", "text": "In particular, our comprehensive examination of religious coping indicates that, both positive and negative religious coping are associated with overall patient QOL and hence, may have an affect on health outcomes. 42 Why should positive or negative religious coping correlate with QOL or other health outcomes? One possibility is that for patients who are intrinsically committed (i.e., observe their religion for the sake of faith itself), religious coping provides meaning and control over their situation. 43 Another possibility is that religious coping is related to other variables, which may in turn influence QOL. In analyses of data related to caregivers of the patients in our study, 32 it was found that the effect of religious coping on well-being was mediated to some extent by social support and optimism, and not by self-efficacy. The same mechanisms may be at work here and future work will explore these possibilities. A third possibility could be that certain emotional or personality related variables are tied to religious coping and indirectly influence QOL. However, note that in our analyses, we controlled for self-efficacy and lifetime history of depression, two variables that tap into dimensions of personality and emotionality. In summary, future research should examine the longitudinal impact of religious coping on health outcomes and if emotional and personality factors and other psychosocial factors such as social support function as potential mediators or moderators of the observed effects.\nIn addition to being cross-sectional, this study is limited in that the number of non-whites was far fewer than the number of whites. Hence, moderating effects of race on religious coping and QOL outcomes could not be conducted. Also, we did not find any significant relationships between positive or negative religious coping and physi-TARAKESHWAR ET AL. 652 cal QOL. Perhaps other variables, such as satisfaction with care provided at the hospital are more tied to this dimension of QOL. For instance, Tables 2 and 3 reveal that for patients at Parkland Hospital in Texas (who were mostly non-white, less educated, and less likely to have health insurance), greater use of both positive and negative religious coping was related to more report of physical symptoms. Future studies should include health service variables, such as satisfaction with care and quality of patient-physician relationship that could be related to patient QOL. Furthermore, participants in our study were likely to be less distressed and hence more likely to report greater use of positive religious coping than negative religious coping. Thus, our study results need to be replicated among more distressed samples. Moreover, the persistence of negative religious coping over time needs to be examined. Despite these limitations, our study makes a contribution by asking patients to report on their own QOL and by comprehensively examining both positive and negative aspects of religious coping. Other studies that examine the use of religion/spirituality among patients with cancer and other illnesses have used a few non-specific items (e.g., prayer, church attendance, and bible reading) or constructs such as spiritual wellbeing 7,44,45 as a means to study religious coping.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Implications", "text": "Overall, the study demonstrates that religious coping is related to the QOL of patients with advanced cancer. A recent study among patients at a family medicine clinic found that 83% of the patients expressed preference to be asked about their spiritual beliefs by their physicians under three conditions: life-threatening illnesses, serious medical conditions, and loss of loved ones. 46 Although addressing the topic of religion in medical practice is laden with controversy, 47 it is evident that for religious/spiritual patients with advanced cancer, use of religious coping is likely to be common and important for their QOL. Moreover, our findings show that assessing religious coping (especially negative religious coping) might be important to understand patients who experience poorer QOL. Even though the use of negative religious coping might be rare, 38 it is important to attend to issues such as anger at God and feelings of abandonment by God, so as to increase the likelihood of improving patient psy-chological and existential QOL (sense of meaning and control) and reducing the likelihood of negative outcomes. On the other hand, for patients who turn to positive religious coping, it would be important to ensure that related resources (e.g., opportunity for worship) are available so that they can maintain their QOL-by enhancing their sense of support and existential meaning. A longitudinal study among female sexual assault survivors found that those who were able to sustain or increase their use of religious coping (in addition to other coping resources) reported the most positive change (e.g., spiritual growth, relationships, self-care) after the traumatic event. 48 Assessments regarding religion/spirituality could be conducted by a few questions posed by physicians to the patients that examine the significance of religion to the patient, how religion influences the patients' coping process and understanding of their illness, and whether their religious needs are being met. Depending on their level of comfort, physicians could refer patients to hospice chaplains or handle discussions on religious coping with the patients themselves. In the future, studies should also determine the benefits of spiritually integrated interventions for patients with terminal illness. Such interventions might be provided within existing palliative care programs or patients might be referred to pastoral care and/or mental health programs that provide such services. These interventions could address patients' religious struggles by providing a safe and empathic space where they can express their feelings of abandonment, punishment, and anger at God without feelings of guilt. This might be an important step for them to find meaning and significance in life and in their illness, and perhaps develop or re-build their relationship with God or a higher power. Discussions could also include how religion/spirituality can promote adjustment to life-threatening illness and impending death. Given that the manifestation of religion can vary across cultures 49 and across different stages of the illness, 41 the interventions need to be sensitive to how they are defining religion and spirituality and its practice. Given that the religious coping measures in our study use the term \"God,\" they may not be applicable for individuals who are more spiritual or for adherents of religions (e.g., Theravada Buddhists) who do not identify with a particular \"God.\" However, from our perspective, religion and spirituality are related rather than indepen-", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RELIGIOUS COPING AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER", "text": "dent constructs. 50 In other words, like religion, spirituality also represents a search for the sacred. The search takes place within a larger religious context that could be traditional or non-traditional. Of note, a few studies have observed that a significant portion of Americans who say they are religious are also spiritual. 51,52 Moreover, the difference between the two constructs is more apparent among younger persons than older persons, 53 and given that our sample was generally older (mean age, 57.46 years), this is less of a concern for the results reported. Nonetheless, it would be important to study how the findings from our study translate to other religious groups, such as Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus.\nIn summary, the findings from our study highlight the importance of religious coping for QOL of patients with advanced cancer, and show that the types of religious coping strategies that patients use is related to better or poor QOL. Although it remains to be seen if these associations are held longitudinally, it is likely that religious coping and QOL are connected for patients with terminal illness, and that addressing religious issues within palliative care would be particularly beneficial for patients who use religion to cope with their illness and related stressors.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "", "text": "E-mail: Holly_Prigerson@dfci.harvard.edu", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TARAKESHWAR ET AL. 656 APPENDIX A.

Design: Themes and subthemes from the Dignity Model were used to devise 22 items; patients were asked the extent to which they believed these specific issues were or could be related to their sense of dignity. Results: Of 211 patients receiving palliative care, \"not being treated with respect or understanding\" (87.1%) and \"feeling a burden to others\" (87.1%) were the issues most identified as having an influence on their sense of dignity. All but 1 of the 22 items were endorsed by more that half of the patients; 16 items were endorsed by more than 70% of the patients. Demographic variables such as gender, age, education, and religious affiliation had an influence on what items patients ascribed to their sense of dignity. \"Feeling life no longer had meaning or purpose\" was the only variable to enter a logistic regression model predicting overall sense of dignity. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence supporting the validity of the Dignity Model. Items contained within this model provide a broad and inclusive range of issues and concerns that may influence a dying patient's sense of dignity.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] While most care providers attending to dying patients would espouse dignity as an overarching value or goal of end-of-life care, few empirical studies have pro-vided guidance or direction on how this might be operationalized or systematically achieved.\nOne of our earlier studies within this program of research established an empirically based model of dignity in the terminally ill (Table 1). 1 From this study, it became apparent that individuals varied considerably in terms of what affected their sense of dignity. The model, however, suggests that these influences could be divided into three broad categories that we labeled: (1) Illness-Related Concerns (factors caused by, or associated with, the underlying illness); (2) the Social Dignity Inventory (social or externally mediated factors); and (3) The Dignity Conserving Repertoire (psychological and spiritual considerations). 1,2 Later quantitative studies helped us establish the importance of selfperception, and the way in which patients experience themselves to be seen or appreciated, as a powerful mediator of preservation of one's sense of dignity. 3,4,6,7 The data seemed to support that listening to patients, validating their concerns, and ascribing meaning to their experience could engender hope and ultimately bolster dignity toward the end of life.\nUsing a cross-sectional, quantitative approach, this current study was undertaken to test further the validity of the dignity model. Patients approaching the end of life were asked to indicate the extent to which they believed various issues and concerns (physical, psychological, social, DIGNITY IN THE TERMINALLY ILL: REVISITED 667  10 \u2022 Continuity of self 14 \u2022 Functional capacity 8 \u2022 Role preservation 9 Social support 7 Symptom distress\n\u2022 Generativity/legacy 4 \u2022 Physical distress 17,21 \u2022 Maintenance of pride 14 Care tenor 1,6 \u2022 Psychological distress 19 \u2022 Hopefulness 11 \u2022 Medical uncertainty 20 \u2022 Autonomy/control 3,5 Burden to others 2 \u2022 Death anxiety 22 \u2022 Resilience/fighting spirit 13 Dignity-conserving practices Aftermath concerns \u2022 Living in the moment 12 \u2022 Maintaining normalcy 12 \u2022 Seeking spiritual comfort 15 a Superscripts correspond to the variable items used to validate the Dignity Model (see Table 2). and existential) derived from the model, were related to or could influence their sense of dignity (Table 2).", "n_publication_ref": 34, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHOD", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Between January 2001 and January 2004, 411 patients with end-stage cancer, meeting eligibility criteria, were approached to participate in this study from two specialized palliative care units in Winnipeg, Manitoba. These units provide inpatient care and coordinate community-based end-of-life care services. The medical status of every patient was reviewed by the treatment staff, who independently ascertained their eligibility for the study on the basis of clinical consensus. Eligibility criteria included: being age 18 years or older; having a diagnosis of terminal cancer with a life expectancy of less than 6 months; an ability to read and speak English; demonstrating no evidence of dementia or delirium that might make completion of the study protocol difficult; and the ability to provide informed consent. Patients were not referred to the study if they were cognitively impaired, unable to give informed consent, or too gravely ill to take part in the protocol.\nThe Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee, University of Manitoba, approved the study, and the Hospital Research Review Boards at both institutions granted formal access to patients.

This approach to dividing the data was used successfully in our previous studies to differentiate patients whose dignity was fractured from those whose dignity was intact. 3 The results of these two subgroups with respect to total item endorsement were compared, using a t test. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted in order examine the predictive value of individual item endorsement with sense of dignity.

Of the remaining 330 patients, 211 (64%) agreed to participate in the study (123 inpatients, 88 outpatients), with a median length of survival from the time of study entry to death being 52 days.\nThe mean age of participants was 67 years (standard deviation [SD] 13.5), and 89 (43%) were men. Forty percent of the study group had less than a high school education, 20% had graduated from high school, and 40% had some college or postgraduate training. Fifty-seven percent of patients were married or cohabiting, with the remainder being divorced (7%), never married (8%), widowed (25%), or separated (2%). Religious affiliation was Protestant, 46%; Catholic, 26%; Jewish, 2%; other, 15%; and no religious affiliation, 11%. Primary tumor sites included lung (26%), gastrointestinal tract (24%), genitourinary system (11%), and breast (13%). A additional 7% of individuals had hematological cancers, and the remaining 19% had various solid tumors. Table 3 indicates the percentage of patients who agreed or strongly agreed that the designated item was or could be associated with their sense of dignity. Other than \"thinking about how life might end,\" each item was endorsed by more than half of the patients as having a possible influence on their sense of dignity. Seven items were endorsed by more than 80% of patients, including \"not feeling supported by your community\" (80.3%); \"not feeling worthwhile or valued\" (81.4%); \"not being able to manage bodily functions\" (82.9%); \"not feeling you made a meaningful or lasting contribution\" (83.3%); \"feeling you no longer have control over your life\" (83.7%); \"feeling a burden to others\" (87.1%); and \"not being treated with respect or understanding\" (87.1%). The median number of items patients associated as having a possible influence on their sense of dignity was 16 (range, 0-22).\nVarious demographic variables, with respect to item endorsement, were examined. For example, younger patients were more likely to ascribe an inability to carry out tasks of daily living (t \u03ed 2.96, p \u03ed 0.003), problems attending to bodily functions (t \u03ed 3.131, p \u03ed 0.002); thoughts about how life might end (t \u03ed 2.383, p \u03ed 0.018), concerns related to their sense of privacy (1.834, p \u03ed 0.068), and difficulty with acceptance (t \u03ed 2.137, p \u03ed 0.034), as having a bearing on their sense of dignity. Women were found to be more likely to identify change in appearance ( 2 \u03ed 4.91, p \u03ed 0.025), the ability to think clearly ( 2 \u03ed 4.34, p \u03ed 0.037) and a meaningful spiritual life ( 2 \u03ed 5.788; p \u03ed 0.016) as being dignity related issues. People who were more educated (having or exceeding a high school education [60.5%]) were likely to identify more items as having a possible bearing on their sense of dignity, including an inability to carry out tasks of daily living (t \u03ed 3.15, p \u03ed 0.002); uncertainly about their illness (t \u03ed 2.40, p \u03ed 0.017); worries about how life might end (t \u03ed 2.39, p \u03ed 0.018); not feeling valued (t \u03ed 2.36, p \u03ed 0.019); and having difficulty with acceptance (t \u03ed 3.59, p \u03ed 0.001). Overall all, those with more education were likely to endorse more items as having possible dignity implications, compared to those with lesser education (t \u03ed \u03ea2.557, p \u03ed 0.011). Patients acknowledging a religious affiliation were more likely to identify difficulty with acceptance ( 2 \u03ed 4.981; p \u03ed 0.026) and not having a meaningful spiritual life ( 2 \u03ed 4.128; p \u03ed 0.042) as being dignity related issue, compared to those not identifying any religious affiliation.\nPatients in more seemingly supportive or structured living arrangements appeared to indicate that lacking in these supports would have a negative influence on their sense of dignity. For example, patients living with someone were more likely to indicate that not being treated with respect could undermine their sense of dignity ( 2 \u03ed 4.316; p \u03ed 0.038); those who were married indicated that not feeling valued could challenge their sense of dignity; and, compared to outpatients, inpatients were more likely to report that not feeling supported by their community could weaken their sense of dignity ( 2 \u03ed 4.274; p \u03ed 0.039).\nAll items, aside from \"being able to fight mentally,\" correlated significantly with the full SDI DIGNITY IN THE TERMINALLY ILL: REVISITED 669 (r \u03ed 0.133-0.319; p \u03ed 0.05-0.0001).

A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the predictive value of individual item endorsement with sense of dignity.

By reframing the major themes and subthemes into specific questions regarding symptoms or concerns toward the end of life, dying patients were able to indicate the extent to which they associated these items as having a possible bearing on their sense of dignity. Aside from \"thinking about how life might end,\" more than half the study cohort endorsed all the remaining items (agreed or strongly agreed) as having a significant possible influence on their sense of dignity.\nThe most highly endorsed items included \"not feeling supported by your community,\" \"not feeling worthwhile or valued,\" \"not being able to manage bodily functions,\" \"not feeling you have made a meaningful or lasting contribution,\" \"not feeling you have control over your life,\" \"feeling a burden to others,\" and \"not being treated with respect or understanding.\" It is noteworthy that each of these items has an interactional dimension, in that they address issues that might find patients either feeling devalued, or having to rely on others for aspects of care that could undermine their personal sense of autonomy and worth. This is consistent with our previously reported findings, which have illustrated the importance of patient self perception as an important mediator of maintained sense of personal dignity. [2][3][4] It is also noteworthy that \"not feeling treated with respect or understanding\" and \"feeling a burden to others\" were the most highly endorsed dignity-related concerns. The connection between these items is critical, in that patients who feel a burden to others often sense that their lives lack purpose or meaning, or perceive that others consider them to no longer be worthy of respect or esteem. Research into desire for death has quite consistently identified feeling a burden to others as a significant factor in suicidal behavior. [10][11][12] This suggests that for health care providers and family members alike, maintaining a relationship or therapeutic stance anchored in respect and understanding, offers some protection against sensing oneself having become a burden to others, or life no longer feeling worth living. 2,4,8 The data also yielded some interesting demographic implications regarding dignity related concerns. For example, younger people, for whom approaching death is often considered untimely, were more likely to ascribe dignity concerns to losses that older patients, over time, may have come to accommodate to (e.g., not being able to carry out usual tasks, not being able to manage bodily functions, anticipating how life might end, compromises to privacy imposed by advancing illness, and generalized difficulty accepting the way life had changed). There were gender differences as well, with women being more likely to associate \"changes in appearance,\" \"difficulty with thinking clearly,\" and \"concerns about having a meaningful spiritual life\" as having dignity implications.\nNot surprisingly, people who were more educated were much more inclined to intellectualize the notion of dignity, hence assigning more items as having possible dignity eroding implications. It is noteworthy that other investigators have associated higher educational level with modestly higher endorsement of desire for hastened death. 13 People who were more religious were also more likely to endorse difficulty with acceptance and concerns about a meaningful spiritual life as having dignity related significance. These findings are consistent with other studies that have shown that spiritual well-being offers some protection against end-of-life despair in those for whom death is imminent. 14 Finally, people in seemly more supportive relationships, such as being married, living with someone, or being looked after within a hospital setting, were more likely to see the relinquishment of \"being valued,\" \"being respected,\"", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CHOCHINOV ET AL. 670", "text": "or \"feeling supported by their community,\" respectively, as having a possible bearing on their sense of dignity. Again, this is consistent with the salutary effects reported by palliative care patients regarding the positive effects of social support and perceived improvement in their quality of life. 15 The small to modest correlations between sense of dignity and each of the individual items is understandable, in light of the fact that patients were asked to rate the extent to which these questions or concerns could have a bearing on their sense of dignity. In other words, because the goal of this study was model validation, patients were asked about the theoretical connection between these items and the construct of dignity, rather than the extent to which each item currently contributed to their current overall sense of dignity. That notwithstanding, it is notable that in relation to loss of sense of dignity, the logistic model underlines the importance of \"feeling that life no longer had meaning or purpose.\" This is consistent with the two most highly endorsed individual items (i.e., \"feeling a burden to others\" and \"not being treated with respect\"). Clearly, engendering a sense of meaning or purpose, as a way of staving off feelings of being a burden and no longer feeling worthy of respect, is a cornerstones of dignity conserving care. 2,8 This study has several limitations. Data were collected primarily from a group of older patients with cancer, all of whom were receiving palliative care. A younger cohort may have yielded different findings, because a person's life experience may influence perceptions of dignity. Patients with nonmalignant illness, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, or end stage renal or cardiac diseaseparticularly those being treated in nonpalliative care specialty units-may have manifest a different constellation of dignity-related concerns. Dignity might also be culturally mediated, and while our cohort had some cultural diversity, the sample size was insufficient to examine this issue adequately. Finally, the construct of dignity may be temporally unstable. Although we reported items that might influence a dying patient's sense of dignity within weeks of death, it could be that the determinants of dignity shift as death draws nearer. To address this issue of temporal stability, prospective longitudinal studies of dignity as life-limiting illness advances are required.\nThis study offers the first validation of the Dignity Model, with results that both support and are consistent with the previously reported findings. Although the items presented within this model are nonhierarchical, they do nevertheless provide a broad and inclusive range of issues and concerns that may influence a dying patient's sense of dignity. Clinicians should consider each item within the Dignity Model in terms of its clinical and therapeutic implications. Indeed, the model suggests that in order to deliver comprehensive quality end-of-life care, close attention must be paid to the various physical, psychological, social, and spiritual concerns and challenges that patients face as they near death. Sensitivity to these issues will draw care providers closer to being able to provide truly comprehensive, empathic, dignity-conserving care.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We gratefully acknowledge the work of our research nurse, Kathy Cullihall.

For a substantial minority, bereavement is a trigger for long-term psychological morbidity. For example, Zisook et al. 1 reported that 2 months after the death, 20% of widows/widowers met criteria for major depression. Approximately 15% met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression 2 years after the death. Another 10%-20% of widows/widowers suffer from complicated grief, a syndrome cluster that predicts considerable morbidity over and above depressive symptoms. 2 It has long been suggested that family and friends who are forewarned of the death are better able to prepare psychologically. 3 The relationship between death forewarning and psychological adjustment is, however, inconclusive. Studies have suggested that sudden spousal death is associated with worse psychological adjustment. 4 Others have shown the opposite: that the greater the forewarning, the worse the psychological outcomes. 5 Finally, some studies have shown no or a mixed relationship. 6 A major reason for these discrepancies is that in most studies, the investigators, rather than the survivors, specified whether the death was anticipated. 7,8 In other studies, the time from illness onset to death was used as a proxy for whether the family was prepared for death. 9 In a third group of studies, it was assumed that friends and family were not prepared if the death occurred from violent causes such as suicide or homicide. 10 These assumptions may not be valid because many deaths among older adults that are classified as sudden or unanticipated are in fact anticipated and viewed as timely by the survivors. 11 A study by Barry et al. 12 differs from the above studies in one important respect. Rather than define preparedness based on characteristics of the death, the definition was based on the survivors' personal sense of preparedness; the bereaved were asked, \"How prepared did you feel for the death?\" Lack of preparedness was associated with complicated grief 4 months and 9 months after the death and with major depressive disorder 9 months after the death. These results suggest that persons who perceived themselves as unprepared for the death may be at risk of bereavement associated morbidity.\nWe had two aims for this study. Our first was to determine if Barry and colleagues' findings about preparedness and mental health would be supported in a large sample of dementia caregivers. These caregivers are an important sample in which to study this relationship as they represent the largest group of caregivers of elderly patients with long-term illness or disability in the United States. 13 Studies also show that many caregivers of patients with dementia are at risk for poor bereavement outcome; roughly 30% of the bereaved have clinically significant depressive symptoms 1 year after the death. 14 Next, we were interested in exploring variables that might be related to preparedness.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "The sample of caregivers was drawn from the REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health) study, a multisite, randomized caregiver intervention trial testing the feasibility and impact of numerous psychosocial interventions on the health and well-being of caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Bereaved caregivers were asked about the amount of time the patient had felt pain before death.\nSubjective demands and burdens of caregiving were measured with the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC), which was used to characterize each of 24 memory and problem behaviors among dementia patients (range, 0 to 96, with higher values indicating more burden). 19 Response options measured whether or not the care recipient exhibited the behavior over the past week, yes or no.\nCaregiver physical health. The health measure consisted of four items that assessed perceived physical health. 20 The first question queried the respondents' self-perceived health with a fivepoint Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Three questions, measured with five-point Likert scales ranging from definitely false to definitely true, were used to ask caregivers to compare their health to others.

[26][27][28] In order to compare our results to previous work in which preparedness was assessed once, we used multivariate logistic regression to test the relationships between preparedness and mental health at the first assessment after the death.

One hundred forty three (64.4%) caregivers visited a physician in the month prior to the death. The median Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) score was 12.

Our finding that 23% of caregivers were not prepared is similar to that found by previous investigators. For example, Barry et al. 12 reported that 25% of caregivers of persons who died from a variety of causes were not prepared. In another study, 20% of the relatives of hospice cancer patients did not think that the death was a certainty as late as 1 to 2 weeks before their loved one's death. 31 Teno and colleagues 32 interviewed caregivers from a national probability sample of 1578 decedents. Approximately 23% of informants reported that the death was \"extremely\" unexpected. Second, lack of preparedness was associated with worse mental health. These findings held when controlling for multiple variables including the caregivers' phys- ical and mental health before the death. Third, preparedness was not associated with factors (i.e., burden, location of the death, and religiosity) that had been postulated by previous investigators to be associated with preparedness.

More importantly, preparedness could serve as a target for intervention prior to the death. Current interventions usually target the bereaved months after the death. 36 Intervening prior to the death is likely to be more beneficial. For example, a study of 73 adult family caregivers showed that support provided prior to the patient's death accounted for 29% of the variance in bereavement distress while support after the death accounted for only 2%. 37 Also, because caregivers frequently accompany their elderly loved one to medical appointments, 38 such an intervention could be delivered during routine clinical care.\nFinally, blacks, caregivers with less education, those with lower income, and those with more depressive symptoms prior to the death were more likely to perceive themselves as \"not at all\" prepared for the death. These results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that these individuals are less likely to receive quality endof-life care. 39,40 We also found that the amount of pain the care recipient was in prior to death was positively associated with preparedness.

For example, when caregivers voice questions and perceive that their questions have been answered, satisfaction and quality of life are improved and there are fewer depressive symptoms. 45,46 ", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "It is important to note the limitations in our findings. First, like other researchers, we used a single question to assess preparedness. A valid and reliable measure of preparedness does not yet exist. 28 Because preparedness is a complex construct, consisting of medical (e.g., knowing what signs and symptoms to expect), practical (e.g., having one's financial affairs in order), psychosocial (e.g., having time to grieve), and spiritual (e.g., making peace with God) components, 47 future work should be directed to capturing the multidimensional nature of preparedness as each of these dimensions could be a target for intervention, depending on a caregiver's needs. Second, our question was asked after the death of the patient. Although mental health prior to the death was controlled for in the analyses, the retrospective nature of the design may introduce bias such that persons suffering from greater mental health morbidity may be more likely to perceive themselves as having been unprepared for the death. A study of bereaved spouses demonstrated, however, that although recalled levels of grief were positively correlated with current levels of grief, bereaved individuals showed considerable accuracy in grief recall. 48 Nonetheless, future studies should assess for preparedness prior to the death, using a valid instrument, in or-der to determine whether preparedness is a risk factor for bereavement associated morbidity. Third, although we found no relationship between a recent visit to a physician and preparedness, we have no data on whether physicians and caregivers discussed death, dying, and bereavement. Finally, our sample was very homogeneous. It was limited to persons providing care to family members with dementia. Our findings should be replicated with other illness, types of death (e.g., resulting from trauma or suicide), and in family members who are not providing care.\nThis work indicates that caregivers of terminally ill patients who are not prepared for the death of their loved one may be at risk for psychiatric illness. If this is the case, health care providers can screen caregivers and target those at risk for more intensive intervention and follow-up.

Design: The project design consisted of ethical decision-making, provider education, and flexible administration of health benefits through co-case management between insurers and care providers. The evaluation study design is a nonexperimental pretest, posttest design comparison of pediatric quality of life and family satisfaction at program entry with repeated measures at 3 months postprogram entry. Quality of life was measured with parent proxy reports of health-related quality of life using the PedsQL\u2122 Version 4.0, and family satisfaction was measured with a 31-item self-administered questionnaire designed by project staff. Results: Forty-one patients ranging in age from infancy to 22 years old were enrolled in the program over a 2-year period. Parents consented to participate in the evaluation study. Thirtyone specific diagnoses were represented in the patient population; 34% were some form of cancer. Improvements in health-related quality of life over baseline were observed for 21 matched pairs available for analysis in each domain of health-related quality of life; positive changes in reports of emotional well-being were statistically significant.

The study authors emphasize the importance of both. Palliative care is focused on comfort and quality of life, and is \" . . . not limited to people thought to be dying and can be provided concurrently with curative or life-prolonging treatments . . . End-of-life care focuses on preparing for an anticipated death.\" 2 The comingling of curative and comfort measures in pediatric end-of-life care is an especially important goal. The reluctance of families and health professionals to abandon curative efforts with children can sometimes lead to denial of imminent death and can result in missed opportunities for resolution and spiritual healing. 3 In 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics and Committee on Hospital Care's definition of pediatric palliative care stated that the contents of care should be comprehensive, aimed at both physical symptoms and socio-emotional and spiritual concerns, and that the timing of care should begin from the point of diagnosis. 4 This definition also suggests that palliative care is appropriate and needed before death becomes imminent and/or treatment fails. Key components of palliative care, for both children 1 and adults, 5 include not only pain and symptom management, but effective patient-provider communication, support for decision-making, coordination of care, spiritual, emotional and psychological care, and bereavement support. Increasing evidence from both the adult 6 and the pediatric literature 7 points to the significance of family and provider perspectives regarding quality of palliative care services and what constitutes effective patient-provider communication that can support decision-making in the case of advanced serious illness.\nWhile consensus is growing regarding the clinical goals and guidelines for pediatric palliative care, the evidence base for clinical practice remains limited. Current research findings suggest that the clinical and psychosocial objectives embodied in these definitions of palliative care for children can best be met by incorporating patient and family members into the decision-making process. 3 A family-centered approach requires time and skill in communication and in eliciting patient and family preferences, needs, and values. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization's statement calling for improved pediatric palliative care states that integrating family goals and values into the care plan can foster good outcomes, \"Determining the goals of care and fashioning an acceptable plan of action are extremely time consuming . . . it is these lengthy and recurrent explanations that enable truly informed consent, emotional peace, and care plans consistent with the goals and philosophy of the patient and family.\" 8 Our present health care reimbursement structure acts as an additional obstacle. Providing this type of care requires flexible administration of the current health benefits, especially related to insurance coverage for home nursing and hospice care.\nIn 1998 a model demonstration program of pediatric palliative care was implemented at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, to test an approach to pediatric palliative care that embodied the principles of pediatric palliative care practice: (1) familycentered ethical decision-making to elicit patient and family preferences; ", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Project design", "text": "The Seattle Pediatric Palliative Care Project consisted of three major program components implemented by an interdisciplinary team under the auspices of Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center-Seattle, a pediatric, tertiary care hospital serving the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.

It was used in a collaborative process between patients, family members, and health providers. The DMT was recorded in a standardized format in the patient record in hard copy format. Thus, the documentation contained in the DMT resided in the patient record and was available to any health providers who treated the patient. This was especially important in cases where there had been discussions or decisions made about advance care directives. The contents of the DMT, which is unique for each patient, was obtained through a facilitated care conference that was held as soon as the patient was enrolled in the program. The conference included the Palliative Care Consultant, specialists and community providers, and the patient and family members. In addition to including the DMT in the patient's medical chart, the summary of the discussion and the action plan contained in the DMT document was distributed to the family, insurance plan, and the medical team and was then used as the basis of the flexible care plan for insurers, providers, and families. DMT discussions were repeated as needed or indicated by patient/family, provider, or insurer, and the DMT document was updated when a change was made in the care plan as the patient progressed through the trajectory of his/her illness.

A full-time benefits coordinator negotiated the flexible administration of benefits with the insurance plans and recruited local hospice nurses to be community case managers. Each participating insurance plan assigned a case manager to the project so that there was a consistent insurance plan response for all enrollees.

An evaluation specialist from the Center for Children with Special Needs directed the outcome measurement efforts at 15% effort.\nThe project team assumed a consultation model. The responsibility for ongoing care, including pain and symptom management, continued to reside with the medical team, either specialty or primary care, who referred the patient to the project.

The items were developed through focus groups, interviews, pretesting, and field testing with measurement development protocols. 12,13 The PedsQL\u2122 consists of a self-reported version for children ages 5-18 and a parent proxy report for parents of children ages 2 to 18 years of age.\nThe PedsQL\u2122 4.0 Generic Core Scales comprises parallel child self-report beginning at age 5 and parent proxy reports. Only the parent proxy report is reported in this study. Too few child reports were available as a result of patient age or cognitive impairment resulting from either underlying diagnosis or disease progression. Only 8 pairs of baseline and follow-up child reports were available.

Scale Scores were computed as the sum of the items divided by the number of items answered, which accounts for missing data. If more than 50% of the items in the scale were missing, the Scale Score was not computed. This accounts for the differences in sample sizes for scales reported in the tables.

A key factor in this project's success is effective communication between families and providers that elicits patient preferences and supports advance care planning. The DMT is an effective approach to guiding conversations among patients, families, health care providers, and insurers. The tool itself provides a flexible structure for discussing medical as well as spiritual and psychosocial concerns. In addition, the DMT enables participants to document areas of concern and to establish a care plan that guides the case management functions of third-party insurers. Developing a partnership with health insurers is another critical element that led to effective curative and comfort modalities and fostered high consumer satisfaction. Comanaging care with a home health/hospice nurse also played an important role in accessing maximum and appropriate insurance benefits that supported integration of curative and comfort care.   The findings from this study lend further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that effective patient/family and provider communication promotes family satisfaction and quality. Recent literature reviews in pediatrics and adult end of life care point to the importance of communication and patient preferences in end of life care, regardless of whether the insurer is a public or a private payer. 1,5 Communication in the context of pediatric palliative care is not a unitary concept, but rather, encompasses a number of discrete clinical skills and practices that are important to families and that can be challenging for many health care providers. The DMT is a tool that can be incorporated in clinical practice of pediatric palliative care. This study also points to the importance of responsiveness of health insurers to care plans that are generated from patient-centered, ethical decision-making. Thus, the DMT also likely played a key role in informing insurers of care needs through the documented discussion in the DMT explaining the reasons behind the plan of care.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HAYS ET AL. 724", "text": "Parent reports of emotional functioning of children showed significant improvement over baseline. Improvements in functioning in other areas showed an increase, but not at a significant level. This intervention, or similar approaches, should be replicated in more systematic, controlled studies to establish more confidence in the effectiveness of specific care processes. Because health-related quality-of-life measurement was limited to parent proxy reports in this study, future research should assess child self-reports with larger sample sizes of children and adolescents capable of self-reporting, because parent and child concordance can vary across domains, with some evidence suggesting concordance between parent proxy reports and child self reports is lowest for emotional functioning. 21 Future research should also use alternative methods of obtaining selfperceptions of quality among younger children under age 5. More research is needed on how to measure quality of life at the end of life in the pediatric population, because much of previous work has focused on the adult population. 22 Overall, the quality-of-life findings in this study are encouraging indicators that this particular tool is sensitive to changes in quality-of-life dimensions in the pediatric palliative care population.\nThe fact that nearly 50% of enrolled patients died before a 3-month follow-up could be com-pleted speaks to two important issues that should help us refine future efforts. First, from a clinical perspective, this study provides some insights into who is a good candidate for pediatric palliative care. The demonstration model had a broad clinical definition of who is a candidate for these services-an enrollee had to have a \"potentially life-limiting condition\" for which a clinician \"wouldn't be surprised if the patient died within 24 months.\" Our selection process succeeded in identifying seriously ill children, nearly half of whom died shortly after enrollment, thus demonstrating that there are a broad range of conditions for which palliative care services may be appropriate. However, early death limited the time available to provide care to these patients and their families. It would be important for the development of palliative care services to broaden the definition of who can benefit from palliative care and seek to meet families earlier in the process so that patients and families can benefit from the care and support throughout the course of the illness.\nA second consideration of the loss of nearly half of the enrolled population prior to obtaining follow-up poses important methodological challenges to the interpretation of the results of the evaluation study. The overall sample size available for the outcome study was small. Yet, despite the small sample size, there were several areas of improvement in satisfaction and quality of life that were evident in this population. It would be important for future studies as well as better overall quality of care, then, to design approaches to working with families earlier in the disease course. This would allow for a more robust and systematic evaluation of care processes, and perhaps isolate specific components associated with desirable outcomes.\nThe results of this descriptive study of an innovative community-based model of pediatric palliative care suggest that it is possible to improve several aspects of quality of life and quality of care for children with life-limiting illness. However, the small sample size, the large number of patients whose death precluded them from the outcome evaluation, the narrow range of generalizability, the difficulty in obtaining reports from seriously ill children themselves, and the limited scope of the nonexperimental evaluation design, led us to interpret the results with caution. More comprehensive, systematic, and controlled trials of the care processes implemented in this demonstration project are needed to more fully comprehend the impact of integrated pediatric palliative care processes studied in this project. Assessment of the quality of the dying experience for children who die is another critical dimension for future research on palliative care processes, because the development of measurement approaches regarding the quality of dying needs to move beyond the adult population 23 to include children. More knowledge about the dying experience can contribute to refinements in our understanding of the timing for palliative care services, the clinical roles needed, and the impact that early integrated palliative care can have on coping among survivors. While this study has limited generalizability to patient populations that are uninsured or underinsured, the clinical diversity of the patient population is a great strength of this study. The experience with this demonstration project suggests that the integrative approach to palliative care can positively influence patient quality of life and family satisfaction for children with a wide range of lifethreatening pediatric illnesses.\nIn summary, there are three essential elements to high-quality pediatric palliative care that emerged from our experience with the Seattle project. Pediatric palliative care should incorporate tools to elicit the expression of patient and family preferences in partnership with clinicians, and these preferences should be implemented through dynamic care plans. The communication should be multidirectional across patient/familyproviders-payers, and should be guided by a structured tool or process such as the DMT. Third, the early involvement of insurance plan case managers working with clinicians, family members, and community-based providers, are needed to support this model of care. These approaches merit more systematic clinical application and evaluation.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This research was supported by a grant from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Similarly, Smith and colleagues 26 found significantly lower daily charges, direct costs, and total costs for patients who died in the inpatient palliative care unit compared to matched controls who died in other units of the hospital.\nOur study updates these findings with data on costs rather than charges 39,40 that are often driven by reimbursement not by true costs and are therefore a poor surrogate for true costs. 41 Additionally, our results are specific to acute care costs associated with an inpatient consultation, an increasingly common way to deliver palliative care to hospitalized patients and their families. 42 Why are costs lower and ICU admission less likely for palliative care compared to usual care patients? One explanation is that PCCTs achieve their aims. That is, they improve communication among patients, their families, and the primary treating physicians about goals of care, including discussion and selection of treatments that result in less use of tests, inappropriate technology, and the ICU. We found that palliative care patients incurred lower laboratory and radiology costs, which was also found by Cowan and colleagues. 40 Palliative care programs that follow patients between inpatient and outpatient care may also lower costs through active care coordination over the course of the illness. 25 A second possible explanation is that patients who choose palliative care may be less ill than patients who do not, which was evidenced in slightly fewer comorbid conditions. However, favorable selection cannot explain all the differences because ancillary and total direct inpatient costs were significantly lower for palliative care patients even after we controlled for the number of comorbidities, diagnosis, and age.\nA limitation of our study is that it is an observational, nonrandomized study in which differences in costs and ICU use could be the result of unobserved differences between palliative care and usual care patients. For example, palliative care patients may have lower costs because they are not as sick or their care is less complicated or they prefer fewer tests and treatments. We controlled for sickness by measuring comorbidities. Additionally, we used propensity score methods to reduce bias from imbalance in observed covariates further but bias resulting from unobserved differences between palliative care and usual care patients may remain. Our results are consistent with most other recent studies of PC in different venues.\nPalliative care during the terminal hospitalization is associated with a judicious use of inpatient resources, particularly for the ICU. Our findings coupled with those indicating better patient and family outcomes with palliative care 20,22,43 suggest both a cost and quality incentive for hospitals to develop palliative care programs.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PENROD ET AL. 858", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "A Guide to Developing a Hospital-Based Palliative Care Program", "journal": "", "year": "2004", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Secondary and tertiary palliative care in us hospitals", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2002", "authors": "C F Von Gunten"}, {"title": "Perspectives on care at the close of life.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the family caregivers' psychological distress is influenced by the patients' performance status while taking into account individual characteristics of caregivers and their unmet needs. Methods: Two hundred twelve family caregivers were assigned to three cohorts according to the patient's performance status, as measured by the Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group Functional Scale (ECOGS).

This philosophy is mirrored by the patients' desire to stay home as long as possible, if adequate and sufficient care is available (Angus Reid Report cited by McWhinney et al. 3 ). Furthermore, the palliative care movement promotes desinstitutionalization in favor of home care. Over the last decade, as community palliative care services become more available, an increasing number of individuals with cancer have chosen to die at home. 4,5 Palliative care at home is recognized to require the help of dedicated caregivers supported by care teams. 6 Informal caregivers may experience psychological morbidity (anxiety, depression) or burden. 7 A growing literature suggests that caring for a terminally ill loved one is a difficult experience that may trigger distress among family caregivers. [8][9][10] Characteristics of informal caregivers' related to their psychological distress are age, state of health, relationship to the patient, 7,[11][12][13] and sense of competence and personal accomplishment. 9,14,15 Informal caregiver distress is also related to patients' characteristics such as the level of functional autonomy, type of cancer, and severity of symptoms. 7,[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Other factors may also influence the psychological distress of family caregivers: the accessibility and availability of home care, [24][25][26] social support, 20,[26][27][28][29] place of death, 27,30 and financial burden. 10,[31][32][33] However, very little research exists that prospectively addresses the family caregiver's psychological distress when providing end-of-life care for a close one.\nThe goal of this study was to determine the extent to which the family caregivers' psychological distress is influenced by the patients' performance status while taking into account individual characteristics of caregivers and their unmet needs.", "n_publication_ref": 40, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "The population under study is defined as those members of a family who fulfil the role of main caregivers of a patient during the palliative phase of patients with cancer in the Qu\u00e9bec City area.

Recent studies highlighted that caregiver's psychological morbidity was equal or greater than the patient's. 23,33 Prevalence of severe psychological distress among patients with cancer varies from 1% to 42%. [44][45][46] Discrepancies in this matter are attributable to a great variability of methods, severity threshold and diagnostic criterions.\nPrevious research has revealed that the distress of the patient has an influence on the distress of the caregiver and vice versa. 19,47 Kurtz and colleagues 48 observed a correlation between the intensity of patient depression and caregiver depression. They noted that patient symptoms were strong predictors of patient depression, which in return predicted caregiver depression. In their study, the authors also determined that there was a continuous interrelation between changes in depressive state of both patients and caregivers. Finally, a recent meta-analysis conducted with 21 independent samples of patients with cancer and their caregivers confirmed the significant positive relationship between patients with cancer and caregivers' psychological distress. 23 Greater attention should be given to the family caregivers' needs in order to address the factors that are likely to increase their level of dis- tress.

According to the conceptual framework developed by Dumont et al. 15 the palliative care caregiver's burden is a psychological experience which has two main components: the cognitive (appraisal) component and phenomenological (meaning) component. From one perspective, the cognitive component underscores the potential evaluation of perceived availability of help and support as a means to cope with the challenges posed by caring for a loved one at the end of life. Access to adequate support provides the caregiver with a greater potential to fulfill his role. Feelings of control and competence help to protect against exhaustion and psychological distress. Also, the phenomenological component refers to a process of capturing the meaning of the caregiver's experience. This process is closely linked to the quality of the relationship with the patient, other family members, as well as the care staff. These relationships contribute to the construction of a meaning, which is an important dimension of adapting to significant loss.

Young caregivers may experience death as a very traumatic event adding to their familial and professional responsibilities. 7,50 Consistent with the reports of others, 7,14,18,9,50,51 this study found a higher level of psychological distress among female caregivers. This may be related to the fact that in addition to the many demands of caring for the patient, women also perform many household tasks. Hagedoorn et al. 14 reported that women who perceived themselves as lacking confidence and/or competence in respect to caring for a loved one with cancer experience higher levels of distress than men. It would be interesting for future researcher to verify if women are more likely than men to delay the hospitalization of a loved one who is in the palliative stage of life. Last, as reported by others, 11,12 the caregiver's reporting of poor health was significantly associated with a high level of psychological distress.

A potential limitation of this study is a selection bias that may have been introduced because clinicians may have avoided soliciting family caregivers to participate for fear of adding to their burden. 52,53 Underrepresentation of caregivers with high levels of psychological distress may have occurred. Furthermore, all participants in this study benefited from a palliative care program. It is also important to note that when the study took place, less than 10% of the end-of-life patients in Canada had access to such programs. In addition, the sample was essentially comprised families of a francophone Quebec origin, which significantly limits the ethno-cultural sensitivity of the study conclusions.

This brief, individualized approach to end-of-life care invites patients to discuss issues that are most important to them and to articulate things they would most want remembered as death draws near. These discussions and recollections are recorded, transcribed, and edited into a generativity document, which are usually given to family or loved ones. While the marked benefits of Dignity Therapy on patients' psychosocial and existential distress have been reported elsewhere, this paper presents data on bereft family members' perspectives regarding the impact of dignity therapy on patients and themselves. Subjects and methods: Sixty family members of deceased terminally ill patients who previously took part in Dignity Therapy completed a questionnaire to elicit feedback about the impact of Dignity Therapy on both the dying patient and themselves. Results: Ninety-five percent of participants reported that Dignity Therapy helped the patient; 78% reported that it heightened the patient's sense of dignity; 72% reported that it heightened the patient's sense of purpose; 65% reported that it helped the patient prepare for death; 65% reported that it was as important as any other aspect of the patient's care; and 43% reported that Dignity Therapy reduced the patient's suffering. Regarding family members, 78% reported that the generativity document helped them during their time of grief; 77% reported that the document would continue to be a source of comfort for their families and themselves; and 95% reported they would recommend Dignity Therapy to other patients of family members confronting a terminal illness.Family members endorse Dignity Therapy as a therapeutic intervention that moderates their bereavement experiences and lessens suffering and distress in terminally ill relatives.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A TERMINAL ILLNESS affects the dying individual and their family members. [1][2][3][4] Research suggests that the patients' illness experience deeply affects family members' psychological and physical health, 5,6 with recollections of those final months, weeks, or days sometimes complicating the grief of the bereft or leaving them with feelings of regret. 6,7 One of the primary goals of palliative and end-of-life care is to improve the quality of life of dying people and their families. The challenge for health care providers is to know what interventions might lessen family psychosocial distress, increase family satisfaction with the provision of palliative care, and enhance the bereavement experience.\nA central tenet in palliative care is that both the patient and family constitute the unit of care. 8 Family members receive care from health professionals in the form of information and support. 6 Relatives vicariously experience patient distress, which can be mitigated by the care the patient receives. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] The quality of life of family members of someone who is dying is thus intimately connected to the care and well-being of their loved one. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of perceived personal dignity among the terminally ill. 12,13 One can thus assume that concerns about the issue of dignity and how best to support it in the provision of end-of-life care would have implications for both patients and family members throughout the palliative phase and into bereavement.\nOur quantitative and qualitative studies have examined the concept of dignity from the perspective of the terminally ill patient, and identified various factors that bolster or erode it. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] The importance of generativity (a term coined by Erik Erikson concerning the satisfaction that adults experience as a result of having generated meaningful or productive ideas and activities including concern about guiding the next generation) as a significant theme in our empirically derived model of dignity in the terminally ill offered direction about how to construct dignity-enhancing interven-tions for patients nearing death, including Dignity Therapy. The goal of Dignity Therapy is to provide patients a generativity or legacy-making opportunity, in order to decrease their sense of suffering, while bolstering their sense of meaning, purpose, dignity, and quality of life.\nThe framework for Dignity Therapy is informed by our empirically derived theoretical framework of dignity in the terminally ill. Information concerning the analytic procedures involved in this qualitative work has been reported elsewhere. 12 The themes and subthemes that arise from the dignity model form the basis of an interview guide that invites patients to discuss issues that matter most to them, or say things they wanted to say and be known to the people closest to them (Table 1). Patients consenting to take part in the study were guided through the Dignity Therapy protocol (Table 2), the details and results of which have been reported elsewhere.\nIn a cohort of terminally ill patients from Winnipeg, Canada, and Perth, Australia, Dignity Therapy was shown to increase patient preparedness for death, heighten their sense of dignity, increase will to live, and, according to participants, help prepare their family members for the future. 1 Patients who participate in this therapy create a generativity document intended for family members and loved ones. As such, patients and families may directly or indirectly experience the DIGNITY THERAPY: FAMILY MEMBER PERSPECTIVES 1077 Dignity Therapy interview that uses the question protocol to direct its content. 3. Depending on the patient's ability and wishes, offer one or two sessions-as described above-in as close proximity as possible (1-3 day interval). 4. Transcribe conversations within 2-3 days of final interview. 5. Over next 24-48 hours, edit transcripts so as to convert dialogue format into polished narrative (involves removing colloquialisms, correcting time sequences, eliminating material not intended for generativity purposes). 6. When editing is complete, revisit the patient to read the entire manuscript, ensuring that all changes are correct and meet the patient's specifications. 7. Any necessary corrections to the document are made within 24-48 hours. 8. When corrections are completed, the patient is provided a hard copy of the generativity document. 9. When they wish to do so, patients may share or bequeath the document to friends, family, or loved ones of their choosing.\neffects of the Dignity Therapy.

These family members also agreed to be approached by a trained research nurse, who sought their participation in the family follow-up portion of the study. Nine to 12 months following the death of the patient, these individuals were contacted by a research nurse and invited to provide feedback about their feelings and reactions to Dignity Therapy. Based on our experience, this timeframe allows resolution of the acute phases of family grief, while still providing enough proximity to the loss to enable accurate recall, thus making it ethically and strategically appropriate.\nAfter obtaining written consent, family participants were asked to complete an evaluation, consisting of Likert scales, and open-and closed-ended questions that assessed the perceived impact of Dignity Therapy on patients and families. This inquiry focused primarily on psychosocial and bereavement related issues.

Of the 60 family members completing the questionnaire, 95% reported that Dignity Therapy helped the patient. In particular, the intervention was seen as a mechanism that empowered patients to share their feelings in a therapeutic and safe environment. Regarding her mother's participation in dignity therapy, one daughter observed, \"Mom was extremely closed emotionally and had huge difficulties expressing her feelings. This gave her an opportunity to do so without feeling vulnerable.\"\nSeventy-eight percent of family members reported that Dignity Therapy heightened the patient's sense of dignity, and 72% reported that that it heightened the patients' sense of purpose. Said a family member of her father's participation in dignity therapy, \"He had something to say, wanted to be heard, wanted to pass on a message of hope. It helped him find some value in what he had done and remember who he was.\"\nSixty-five percent of family members indicated that Dignity Therapy helped the patient prepare for death; 65% indicated that the intervention was as important", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MCCLEMENT ET AL. 1078", "text": "as any other aspect of the patients care; and 43% reported that it reduced the patient's suffering.

A daughter observed, \"Reading the document gave my mom a sense of accomplishment I believe. It gave her a tangible way of looking back at a life well lived.\" Said another family member about the impact of Dignity Therapy for her relative, \"To share feelings and the past is a valuable and important means of showing that life has meaning.\"\nNotions of the patient being able to leave behind a tangible legacy for immediate and subsequent generations was also identified by families as being a positive outcome of Dignity Therapy. The wife of a patient remarked, \"He felt that our grandsons, including our latest whom unfortunately he never lived to see, would get some idea of his life and what he had achieved.\" Another family member stated, \"It [Dignity Therapy] legitimises your life and provides an opportunity to put down on paper what you hope is your legacy.\"\nWith regard to family members' reports of their bereavement course, 78% reported that the generativity document helped them during their time of grief; 76% indicated that the document would continue to be a source of comfort for their families and themselves; and 95% reported they would recommend Dignity Therapy to other patients of family members dealing with a terminal illness. One family member explained, \"I think the Dignity Therapy truly helped him feel as though he were doing something useful and to be able to leave behind a part of himself. That in turn has helped myself and the children as it is almost like receiving a special gift of his words that we can have for our life time.\" Another family member remarked, \"I would say it [the document] was more helpful than any mourning aspect. It helped me move past it. Family and friends are certainly a support but through the document, my Mom was also able to provide support.\" Generativity documents typically contained messages of love, affirmation and support that gave family members solace in their bereavement. Such messages were characterized as tangible \"gifts\" to the living. Said a daughter, \"The comfort comes from feeling I'm sharing in my Mom's life even after her death.\" Said another daughter, it was something to hold onto at the time of Dad's passing and it made Dad's life and ways alive and tender.\"\nInformation was also collected from family members concerning the ways in which the generativity document was stored, shared, and reviewed. The document tended to be stored in a \"safe place\", often with important personal/legal papers, family heirlooms and collections of patient-related memorabilia. Copies made of the original document ranged from 1 to 30 with a mean of 5.6 copies. Families indicated that they had shared the manuscript extensively with friends and other family members (e.g., posting it on-line as a virtual memorial); using it as the basis for eulogies and obituaries.\nWith the exception of one family member who stated, \"I still feel too sad to read it, but in time, I will,\" all family members reported reading the generativity document at least once upon receiving it, with a range of between 1 and 12 readings. While some family members found it helpful to read the document soon after the patient's death; others chose to read it later into their bereavement period.\nWhile the vast majority of family feedback was positive, there were some instances of dissatisfaction. One wife was concerned that the document contained some material that might be hurtful to her husband's siblings. (The protocol is extremely vigilant in addressing these issues with patients and their families, but in this instance, unbeknownst to the patient and his spouse, the document was taken by others who did not have permission to access its content). In two instances, spouses felt that the document was not an entirely accurate depiction of their deceased husband; in one instance this was because of perceived errors of omission, while in another instance, was attributed to a tone of depression that the wife felt created a rather distorted picture of her late husband.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "In a small number of instances, the audio-recording of the patient's dignity therapy session spawned an unforeseen ethical issue; how to respond to family member requests for a copy of the actual taped interview. Two family members contacted the research nurse to DIGNITY THERAPY: FAMILY MEMBER PERSPECTIVES 1079 inquire about receiving a copy of the unedited audiotaped interview. Reasons for requesting the tape included seeking out clarification for something that appeared in the generatively document, and in one instance, the opportunity to be able to listen to their deceased loved ones actual voice. Such a request posed a moral dilemma for the research team.\nWhile providing a copy of the tape to family members might meet their perceived need and afford them some benefit in the bereavement period, the patient had not given a priori consent for the tape to be released. Moreover, unlike the pristine generativity narrative, edited and approved by the patient for dissemination to family members, the raw data from the taped interview often contained errors of omission, material not targeted in any way to generativity-related issues, and occasionally details that might cause pain or offense to the document recipients. In one instance, the husband of a deceased participant wanted to hear the tape, so as to clarify something he had read in the document. However, the tape made reference to a longstanding conflict the patient had had with another family member. The research team was concerned that the patient would not have wanted this information released, as she had in fact indicated this particular reference be omitted from the final written generativity document. In consultation with the University Ethics Committee, a decision was reached to provide him with the tape, providing the contentious portion of the tape be erased. This compromise was well received by the family member, who found listening to the tape provided the peace of mind and clarification sought. In another instance, a woman asked that she receive a copy of her husband's unedited Dignity Therapy tape. In this case, the ethical issues were less problematic, in that this was a close and nonconflicted couple. The wife had in fact sat in on the entire Dignity Therapy process, and was well aware of the content of the tape sessions. When asked, about 1 year after the death of her husband, to compare the experience of the tape with the document, she stated that the tape was raw, painful, and so difficult to listen to that only she and her son would ever even know of its existence. On the other hand, she stated that everyone in her family and extended family had a copy of the generativity document, and that it provided comfort to, and was read frequently by, each of them.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Although the literature frequently refers to the importance of dignity in end-of-life/palliative care, little empirical work related to this construct has been reported. Moreover, the focus has tended be on questions about how to enhance the dignity of the patient. This study examined a novel intervention-Dignity Therapy-directed toward the patient and the family. The intervention provides a potential enduring bridge between the patient and surviving family, offering solace and support at the end stages of the patient's life and during the bereavement period. The vast majority of family participants who participated in this study evaluated the intervention favorably, both for themselves as well as their terminally ill relative. Families clearly endorsed the notion that Dignity Therapy helped the patient, conferred a heightened sense of purpose and dignity, helped the patient prepare for death, and reduced the patient's suffering. From a family member's perspective then, Dignity Therapy is seen as a potent intervention that helps affirm the value of the patient's life in the face of death.\nDignity Therapy also appeared to have a positive impact on family bereavement. Bereaved family members are challenged to adjust to a world devoid of the physical, social and psychological presence of the deceased. 19 In addition to experiencing the death of the family unit as it has been known, families lose their interactional selves in relation to the deceased. 20 Bereavement care must therefore help family members find ways of transforming their attachment to the deceased and establishing new forms of ongoing relationship to the memories of that person. 21,22 Zisook states, \"perhaps the most powerful means of mitigating the anguish of losing a loved one is to maintain a continuing relationship with the deceased person\" (p. 324). 23 Our findings suggest that the generativity document helps forge such a relationship for surviving family members. In so doing, Dignity Therapy has the potential to help family members who must cope with both the death of the patient and the death of the family unit as it had previously been experienced.\nWhile satisfaction for Dignity Therapy was largely positive, there were some instances where the family expressed some misgivings. This occurred either as a result of feeling the document created an incomplete or inaccurate picture of their loved one; that the document might hurt others reading it; or fear that the content might stir painful emotions during the bereavement process. These rare but notable instances of dissatisfaction raise some important issues regarding Dignity Therapy as a bereavement intervention. First, it is critical that patients be selected carefully, so as not to be at risk of delivering a document that provides a distortion of their former self. Next, it is important MCCLEMENT ET AL. 1080 that patients are able to indicate who they wish to bequeath the document to, and that every effort is made to adhere to their expressed wishes. Finally, it must be understood that family members will read the generativity document at a time of their choosing. Like photographs, video recordings, or personal effects, the generativity document can evoke memories and emotions that should be confronted when the bereft feels able to do so. One final observation is that while 19 family members were present during Dignity Therapy sessions with the patient and interviewer in every instance of later dissatisfaction, the family member had not been an active participant in the Dignity Therapy process. Perhaps participation by family members ensures that there are no later surprise revelations. Additionally, family members are often able to help facilitate the interview process by offering suggestions or cues that might lead to more meaningful and fulsome disclosures.\nFamily members commented upon the importance of the generativity document for adult family survivors, as well as children and grandchildren. It is apparent that the generativity document has potential intergenerational impact. As Kuhl 24 observes:\nTo know who we are as adults we must understand who we were as children in the context of our family of origin. This is strengthened by knowing the context of our family history through past generations. A feature of knowing one has a terminal illness is visiting or revisiting one's place in, one's relationship to, the family of origin. (p. 235).\nThis \"knowing,\" consisting of understanding one's place in and relationship to the family of origin may be gleaned through reading a generativity document. Such understanding may in turn inform and shape the experiences of future family members when faced with their own mortality. To the extent that such knowledge is fundamental to one's understanding of self and can help engender peace and a sense of meaning in the context of a life-threatening illness, 1 the potential generational effects of the generativity document must not be underestimated.\nWe recognize several limitations to the family portion of this project. Family respondents in this study were primarily elderly female spouses of the patient and adult-children. We cannot presume that their perspectives reflect those of other family members. While we are currently conducting a small study of Dignity Therapy in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), perceptions of families whose relative died from an illness other than cancer warrants investigation. Sixteen family members (11.5%) declined to take part in an evaluation of Dignity Therapy. Little is known about these individuals regarding their characteristics, end-of-life concerns, or conflicts that influenced their decision not to provide their perspectives. The family members participating in this study were largely white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant. This raises the question as to what extent notions of dignity are culturally bound. The ways in which dignity is understood and experienced in other cultures has not been explored, and merits further investigation.\nDespite these limitations, it appears that Dignity Therapy is a feasible, effective, and novel intervention, which can enhance the bereavement course for palliative care families. The bereaved may be at risk for disturbances of physical and psychological health, [25][26][27] and often decline self-care activities. 28 Therefore a range of sensitive and appropriate interventions are needed to support family members adjusting to loss. An international randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Dignity Therapy, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is currently underway in Winnipeg, Canada, New York, and Perth, Australia. This RCT will allow us to extend this work and examine the impact of Dignity Therapy on family depression, complicated grief, and family satisfaction with advanced cancer care. This RCT could provide additional support for the application of Dignity Therapy as an intervention that improves quality of care for both palliative patients and their family members.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DIGNITY THERAPY: FAMILY MEMBER PERSPECTIVES 1081", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Dignity therapy: A novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "H M Chochinov; T Hack; T Hassard; L J Kristjanson; S Mc-Clement; M Harlos"}, {"title": "End-oflife caregiving: what helps family caregivers cope?", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2003", "authors": "E M Redinbaugh; A Baum; S Tarbell; R Arnold"}, {"title": "Reciprocal suffering: the need to improve family caregivers' quality of life through palliative care", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "1998", "authors": "D W Sherman"}, {"title": "The experience of family members caring for a dying loved one", "journal": "Int J Palliat Nurs", "year": "2004", "authors": "A Perreault; F Fothergill-Bouronnais; V Fiset"}, {"title": "Palliative care for families: Remembering the hidden patients", "journal": "Can J Psychiatry", "year": "2004", "authors": "L J Kristjanson; S Aoun"}, {"title": "Family members' perceptions of palliative cancer care: Predictors of family functioning and family members' health", "journal": "J Palliat Care Winter", "year": "1996", "authors": "L J Kristjanson; J A Sloan; D Dudgeon; E Adaskin"}, {"title": "Why are bereaved family members dissatisfied with specialised inpatient palliative care service?

The proportion of patients over 75 years starting renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United Kingdom has increased from 18% of all new RRT patients in 1998 to 25% in 2005, 1 while in the United States the proportion of those over 75 years has increased from 7.6% in 1980 to over 25% in 2004. 2 Although dialysis has greatly improved survival and quality of life for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is growing recognition that dialysis may not always be the optimal choice, especially for older patients with multiple comorbid conditions and poor functional status. [3][4][5][6][7] National data on the numbers of patients managed conservatively (without dialysis) is not yet available, but there is early evidence that numbers in the United Kingdom are increasing. 6 This has led to the development of conservative management pathways, which do not include dialysis but that focus on measures to slow deterioration of renal function, active management of symptoms and the complications of renal disease, and anticipation of decline through advance planning. [8][9][10] Despite the focus on symptom management within these conservative management pathways, little is known of the epidemiology of symptoms in this population.

It also asks about the presence and frequency of four additional psychological symptoms. MSAS-SF has been validated in populations with advanced disease, including both cancer and noncancer conditions. 13,14 It has also been adapted for use in patients with CKD. 15 Four MSAS-SF summary scores have been validated: a 10item global distress index (MSAS-GDI), which is considered to measure overall symptom distress; a physical symptom subscale (MSAS-PHYS), based on 12 physical symptoms (lack of appetite, lack of energy, pain, feeling drowsy, constipation, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, change in taste, weight loss, feeling bloated, and dizziness); a psychological symptom subscale (MSAS-PSYCH) derived from 6 psychological symptoms (2 of which are in the main 28 symptoms [difficulty sleeping and difficulty concentrating] and 4 of which are the additional psychological symptoms [worrying, feeling sad, feeling nervous, and feeling irritable]) and a total score (TMSAS) of the mean distress level for all 32 symptoms.

This approach has been recommended by Van Manen and collegues. 18 Although the response rate that we achieved (62%) was moderate, this is comparable to that achieved in similar studies of patients approaching the last months or years of life, such as the 61% achieved by Jordhoy et al. 20 Recruitment is recognized to be a problem in these populations, and considerable efforts were made to maximize this through recommended strategies such as active communication with recruiters, regular recruiting updates, and maintaining simplicity in recruitment processes. 20 These are novel data. Symptom prevalence has not previously been studied in conservatively managed patients with stage 5 CKD. 11 A recent pilot study comparing symptoms in patients approaching stage 5 CKD with symptoms in patients with cancer suggests that the prevalence of symptoms may be comparable in the two populations. 21 A number of studies have explored symptoms in patients receiving dialysis, although the majority of studies focus on one specific symptom, rather than the whole range of symptoms experienced. 11 The prevalence of symptoms reported in this study of conservatively managed patients can be compared to those reported in a recent systematic literature review of symptom prevalence in dialysis populations. 11 A number of symptoms were very similar in prevalence: lack of energy was 76% in this study (compared to a mean prevalence of 71%, weighted by study size, in the literature review), lack of appetite was 47% (compared to 49%), and sleep disturbance was 41% (compared to 44%). But pruritus (74%), shortness of breath (61%), pain (53%), and feeling sad or depressed (44%) are all more common in this conservatively managed population than the prevalence reported in dialysis populations (55%, 37%, 47%, and 27%, respectively). Nausea (at 26% prevalence) was less common in this conservatively managed population than in dialysis populations (33%).", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SYMPTOMS IN STAGE 5 CKD MANAGED WITHOUT DIALYSIS 1271", "text": "One of the main difficulties in comparing with other studies of symptom prevalence is variations (and hence constraints on comparability) in the symptom assess-ment instruments used. 11 Two recent studies of symptom prevalence in dialysis patients use a modified version of the Edmonton symptom assessment scale, and report the prevalence of moderate/severe symptoms. 22,23 Recording is based on a 0-10 Likert scale; the terms \"moderate\" and \"severe\" are attached to scores of 4-6 and 7-10, respectively; this approach is different from that used in this study with MSAS-SF, where patients were asked to rate a symptom as \"none,\" \"a little,\" \"somewhat,\" \"quite a lot,\" or \"very much.\" One of the reasons we chose to use MSAS-SF in the same way as Weisbord and colleagues was to enable direct and more detailed comparison. They studied a highly selected group of 19 patients with high comorbidity receiving haemodialysis, using a modified version of MSAS-SF (as in this study) and reported a mean number of symptoms of 10.5 (range, 1-22) identified using this instrument. 24 This is slightly less than the 11.6 reported in this study, but with similar range (0-22 in this study). Prevalence of several symptoms in the study by Weisbord and colleagues is remarkably similar to this study, with lack of energy 74% (compared to 76% in this study), drowsiness 63% (65%), dry mouth 58% (50%), and pain 53% (53%) all similarly frequent. Numbness/tingling was more common (63% compared to 27% in this study) and itching was less common (53% compared to 74%); this may reflect the higher number of patients with diabetes in the study by Weisbord and colleagues (63% compared to 26% in this study) and hence greater incidence of diabetic neuropathy, and also the fact that Weisbord and colleagues studied patients on dialysis, which may reduce itch.\nIn nephrology, the predominant focus has been on dialysis and other interventions to minimize disease progression. In general, symptoms are poorly recognized and managed. [24][25][26][27][28]  used to assess symptoms in advanced cancer populations, 13,29,30 and the use of MSAS-SF in this study enables comparison with advanced cancer, where symptom control needs are already well established and generally better recognized. Table 5 compares the findings from the MSAS-SF subscales in this study and in the study by Weisbord et al. 24 to studies of advanced cancer populations using MSAS-SF. First, scores for the conservatively managed renal patients are overall of the same order as for patients with cancer, suggesting symptom control needs are at least as great. Second, the global distress index (GDI) and average distress score (TMSAS) are similar or slightly higher than those reported in cancer. It is not clear whether this reflects the renal disease itself, or the older age or greater comorbidity of the renal patients in this study. Third, although the physical symptom subscale (PHYS) scores are slightly less, the total number of symptoms experienced is higher, especially when additional renal symptoms are taken into consideration. This too indicates that symptom control needs may be considerable. It is also of note that both numbers of symptoms and GDI are higher for the conservatively managed patients than the dialysis patients, suggesting that evidence from dialysis populations may not be readily transferable to the conservatively managed group of patients with stage 5 CKD. It is not known how symptoms may change in the conservatively managed stage 5 CKD population as renal function declines and death approaches; this will be addressed within the wider longitudinal study.\nThere are some important differences between the populations. This renal study population is considerably older (mean age 82 \u03ee 6.6 years) than the comparison populations either on dialysis or with advanced cancer (mean or median age between 61 and 68 years). Patterns of renal pathology are also different in this conservatively managed group, compared to the U.K. prevalent RRT population, with levels of diabetic nephropathy (26% compared to 12%), renal vascular disease (24% compared to 4%), and uncertain etiology (31% compared to 19%) all notably higher in this study. 1 In one of the few previous descriptions of conservatively managed patients, Smith and colleagues 6 identify 63 patients (of 321 patients with advanced CKD) for whom conservative (nondialytic) management was recommended; these 63 patients were younger than in this study (with a mean age 71 \u03ee 12 years) and with a higher proportion with diabetic nephropathy (43%, compared to 26% in this study). Few studies have been made of older cancer populations, constraining any \"age-similar\" comparisons. Comorbidity data are not reported in the cancer studies, but as in the study by Weisbord et al., 24 the older CKD population in our study has high levels of comorbidity which is likely to increase the diversity of symptoms reported. More detailed comparisons of patterns of severity can be made. Chang et al. 13 reports the amount of distress each symptom caused, as identified by MSAS-SF. These naturally focus on symptoms which predominate in cancer, but given this proviso, Table 6 allows direct comparison of 8 symptoms common to both conditions. Both studies also used measure of physical status, and details of these in both populations are included for comparison. The cancer population studied by Chang and colleagues had similar physical status to this study population, although with slightly wider range, as might be expected in patients with cancer.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "SYMPTOMS IN STAGE 5 CKD MANAGED WITHOUT DIALYSIS 1273", "text": "Lack of energy and feeling drowsy are both more common in conservatively managed stage 5 CKD, and reported as more severe. Shortness of breath is more common for these renal patients, but less distressing than for patients with cancer. Pain is slightly less prevalent and reported as less bothersome, although it is clearly still a major problem overall for patients with MURTAGH ET AL. 1274 CKD, and the disproportionately higher levels of moderate or severe pain in CKD patients indicate pain control may be particularly important. Lack of appetite and difficulty sleeping are similar in prevalence, but less distressing, and constipation and weight less are both less prevalent and less distressing. As well as these differences, the renal population studied also had additional renal symptoms such as restless legs and muscle cramps or soreness adding to their overall symptom burden. These are symptoms not generally reported in cancer populations, and so not available for comparison. This evidence suggests that although the symptom needs of the conservatively managed CKD population may be considerable and overall comparable to those of the advanced cancer populations, the patterns of individual symptom prevalence and the severity of those symptoms are different. This has implications for models of care.\nThere has been much debate in specialist hospice and palliative care services about whether and how models of palliative care might extend from cancer to noncancer. 31,32 In terms of symptom control needs, this study has demonstrated that assessment using a generic symptom assessment instrument such as MSAS-SF uncovers considerable symptom burden. First, clinical services need to focus on introducing regular symptom assessment into the routine care of conservatively managed CKD patients. Regular symptom assessment is integral to hospice and palliative care services, but is not yet routine in nephrologic care. Second, research needs to be directed toward the most common and distressing symptoms; symptoms such as itch, dyspnea, and pain, as well as the functionally disabling symptoms of fatigue, drowsiness, and poor concentration. Finally, as the numbers of stage 5 CKD patients steadily increase and the conservative management pathway itself becomes more common, there is urgent need to develop and evaluate appropriate models of care for these patients and their families.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "", "journal": "", "year": "2005", "authors": "D Ansell; T Feest; R Rao; A Williams; C Winearls"}, {"title": "National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases", "journal": "", "year": "2006", "authors": " Us Renal Data;  System"}, {"title": "Management of chronic renal insufficiency in frail older patients who are unfit for renal replacement therapy", "journal": "Rev Clin Gerontol", "year": "2003", "authors": "K Czapla"}, {"title": "Referral of elderly patients with severe renal failure: Questionnaire survey of physicians", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "1996", "authors": "R G Parry; A Crowe; J M Stevens; J C Mason; P Roderick"}, {"title": "Outcome of renal replacement therapy in the very elderly", "journal": "Nephrol Dial Transplant", "year": "2001", "authors": "S K Munshi; N Vijayakumar; N A Taub; H Bhullar; T C Lo; G Warwick"}, {"title": "Choosing not to dialyse: Evaluation of planned non-dialytic management in a cohort of patients with end-stage renal failure", "journal": "Nephron Clin Pract", "year": "2003", "authors": "C Smith; M Silva-Gane; S Chandna; P Warwicker; R Greenwood; K Farrington"}, {"title": "Dialysis in the over-80s", "journal": "Age Ageing", "year": "2005", "authors": "J Tattersall"}, {"title": "Conservative treatment to slow deterioration of renal function: Evidence-based recommendations", "journal": "Kidney Int", "year": "1999", "authors": "E Burgess"}, {"title": "Maximum Conservative Mangement of End Stage Renal Failure: What can patients and their families expect?

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Particularly in hospital settings, patients and families have reported inadequate pain and symptom relief as well as unwanted life-sustaining treatment at the end of life. [9][10][11] Assistance for patients and families as they attempt to understand complex medical information including prognosis and treatment options appears to be less than adequate. 12 Hospice referrals tend to be initiated late in the course of illness despite the positive association between hospice length of stay and family perceptions of the benefits. [13][14][15] In recent years, hospital-based palliative care (PC) programs have been developed to address these deficiencies. [16][17][18][19][20] These interventions are designed to improve symptom management, help patients and families better understand prognosis and treatment options, clarify goals of care, and assist in planning for disease progression. [21][22][23][24] Interdisciplinary PC teams are believed to be particularly helpful in addressing the full spectrum of patients' health, spiritual, and psychosocial needs, and aligning treatment choices with patients' values and goals. 25 Evidence of the effectiveness of interdisciplinary inpatient PC in improving clinical outcomes, satisfaction with hospital care, and use of hospice is limited.

Proxies were instructed to answer the survey items as they thought the patient would.\nSymptom severity was measured using the Physical Area scale of the Modified City of Hope Patient Questionnaires (MCOHPQ). 51 The Physical Area scale addresses pain, fatigue, sleep changes, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, change in appetite, and shortness of breath. Higher scores indicated greater symptom severity.\nPatients rated their emotional and spiritual support using items taken from the MCOHPQ Emotional/Relationship Area and Spiritual Area scales. 51 Emotional support items included: anxiety, burden to family, support they received, isolation, opportunity to discuss illness and possible death, and treatment wishes/goals. Higher scores indicated greater emotional burden. Spiritual support included: the importance of participation in spiritual or religious experiences from the Spiritual Area scale, and two items developed by the investigators: ability to find meaning in one's life, and support given by religion or spiritual belief. Higher scores reflected greater support.\nThe patient's satisfaction with their inpatient experience was measured by the MCOHPQ Place of Care Environment scale and the Doctors, Nurses/Other Care Providers Communication scale. 51 The Place of Care Environment scale addressed experiences receiving pain management and symptom relief, psychological and social support, discharge planning, and end-of-life planning. Higher values indicated more positive feelings. The Doctors, Nurses/Other Health Care Providers Communication scale addressed the level of caring and respect a patient felt from their providers, as well as the opportunity, ease, and the level of understanding the patient had with their providers.\nHigher scores represented greater caring, respect and understanding between patients and their providers. A composite score for each scale was computed by summing the scores for all items in a scale and di-viding the sum by the number of items completed. Cronbach \u2423, a measure of internal consistency was computed for each scale. Cronbach \u2423 were: 0.66 for Physical scale, 0.18 for Emotional/Relationship scale, 0.65 for Spiritual scale, 0.65 for the Place of Care Environment scale, and 0.65 for the Doctors, Nurses/ Other Health Care Providers Communication scale. These \u2423 indicate fair agreement among the individual items for the Physical and Spiritual scales but a lack of agreement for the Emotional/Relationship scale.\nPhysical performance was measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scale (ECOG). 52 The total number of comorbidities, a measure of disease burden, was obtained with the RxRisk score program. This program uses a patient's prior 12 months of prescriptions to identify the presence of distinct chronic diseases based on common medications prescribed for each chronic disease. 53 Costs were computed for all health services used within the 6 months following index hospitalization discharge. These services included emergency department, clinic, hospital outpatient, and home health visits, hospital readmissions, skilled nursing facility admissions, and pharmacy fills. Costs of health services were assigned using the predetermined internal MCO rate structure and vendor contracts based on per diem and case rate calculations. ICU admission data was only available for the Denver and San Francisco sites. The cost of each palliative care team was computed based on the total time for each team member multiplied by the team member's hourly wage and benefits.\nHospice measures included the number of patients enrolled in hospice, the number of days from study enrollment to hospice enrollment, and hospice length of stay (LOS). All measures, including mortality, were obtained from the MCO's databases using standard data extract protocols.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Statistical analyses", "text": "All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Increased patient satisfaction has been reported from previous research on palliative care interventions. 28,29,43 We found no differences in physical symptoms which is inconsistent with other studies on inpatient palliative care interventions. 23,38,42,43 In particular, we found no differences in pain symptoms from study enrollment to index hospitalization discharge. There are several possible explanations. First, patients in this study reported relatively low physical symptoms at study enrollment. The mean pain rating on a scale of 1 to 10 was 3.4 suggesting that pain was less than in other reported populations whose symptoms were more severe. 23,42 Second, the average index hospital- ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IMPACT OF AN INPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE TEAM 187", "text": "ization LOS after study enrollment was 4.9 days, a shorter time for the IPCS team to manage complex physical symptoms compared to studies with longer interventions. 23,42,43 Finally our patient population survived for a longer period of time indicating they might be earlier in their disease state than other inpatient palliative care patients. 34,58 There was no difference in the proportion of patients enrolled in hospice, but IPCS patients had longer hospice stays. MCOs have higher rates of hospice utilization and longer hospice stays compared to fee for service. 55 As all participants were MCO members, it is possible that IPCS would not be able to increase an already high hospice enrollment rate. Finally, patients and their families may not have considered hospice at their index hospitalization because this was not an option they felt necessary at this stage in the patient's illness.\nWe were not surprised that we had significantly more ADs at index hospital discharge because ADs were addressed with each intervention patient. Increased ADs subsequent to palliative care interventions is consistent with the literature. 27 There was no difference in the number of inpatient readmissions between the IPCS and UC, but IPCS patients had lower inpatient readmissions costs. These lower readmission costs are partially explained by fewer ICU admissions. Reduced ICU admissions may have been due to more clearly defined patient goals of care and more effective communication of these goals in the medical record and through advance directives. Other studies have found decreased ICU admissions. 34 Overall survival between IPCS and UC patients did not differ.

There was no difference in mortality between IPCS and UC patient over a 14-day period postenrollment, whether or not they were still hospitalized, indicating that overall mortality was not different at that site.\nThe IPCS intervention did not vary among sites with respect to the components or core features of the intervention. However, uniqueness in the hospital culture, variability in palliative care staffing levels, patient support available at discharge, individual team members' palliative care experience, and the functionality and maturity of each team did vary between sites as would be expected. Further study would be needed to understand if any of these factors might affect patient outcomes.\nOther areas that would benefit from future research include which components of the palliative care intervention are most effective in achieving positive outcomes and how to apply the interdisciplinary palliative care team in other care settings.\nWe identified two study limitations. One limitation of the study was the lack of some measurable process measures, e.g., what symptoms and issues were helped by which components of the IPCS. A second limitation was participants in this study were members of a health plan with an integrated medical delivery system which may limit generalization of study outcomes in other settings.\nThis study provides evidence for the positive impact of IPCS consultations on satisfaction with care and decreased health care costs. It also contributes new information on the impact of this service on ICU admissions and hospice utilization.

Design: study included: (1) interrupted time-series design utilizing mean daily costs preintervention and postintervention; (2) matched cohort analysis comparing PC to usual care patients; and (3) analysis of symptom control after consultation. Setting: Large private, not-for-profit, academic medical center in San Francisco, California, 2004-2006. Subjects: Time series analysis included 282 PC patients; matched cohorts included 27 PC with 128 usual care patients; clinical outcome analysis of 48 PC patients.

Medicare's long term financial stability may be challenged, forcing hospitals to increase their focus on the provision of high-quality, yet fiscally responsible care.\nIn response to a call for quality and cost-efficient end-of-life care, palliative care programs have emerged across the country. The number of academic, community and faith-based hospitals offering palliative care services is growing rapidly. A study of the growth of palliative care utilizing data from the American Hospital Association found that 25% of all U.S. hospitals had palliative care programs in 2003. 2 Despite the proliferation of inpatient palliative care programs, few studies have rigorously examined the economic and clinical impact of such programs.\nIn a study of patients with cancer seen in a palliative care unit, Smith and colleagues 3 found that daily charges and costs were reduced by 66% after transfer to the unit. Two randomized controlled trial studies of inpatient palliative care programs found reductions in costs attributed to the programs of 38%-50%. 4,5 A study of an inpatient consultation service found total daily direct costs to be $239 lower for patients receiving a consultation when compared to a usual care group. 6 Another inpatient consultation service study demonstrated significantly lower charges during the 5 days postconsultation. 7 A program designed to improve cancer care for underserved rural patients was found to be associated with lower overall cancer treatment costs. 8 Finally, a Canadian study involving two newly introduced palliative care programs observed cost neutrality. 9 Studies like these either rely primarily on the retrospective creation of a control population, do not take into account overall decreasing hospital costs over time, or rely solely on hospital charges. While case control studies account for trends over time, the difficulties posed by matching very complicated cases to similar controls often limit use of this method. The current study improves on past pre-/postpalliative care cost comparisons by predicting future costs based on history. This is accomplished through the integration of trends and cycles into the estimation of expected post-intervention values. A retrospective matched cohort analysis was conducted to add a financial comparison of palliative care patients with those receiving usual care. The economic analyses are further complemented by clinical findings in the area of pain and symptom management. Our multifaceted approach is similar to that adopted by O'Mahony and colleagues 10 in their preliminary evaluation of a hospitalbased inpatient palliative care consultation service but improves upon the pre-/postpalliative care eco-nomic evaluation by introducing time series analytic methods.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the economic and clinical impact of the inpatient palliative care consultation service at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, California, using a multifaceted approach. Economic analyses were conducted by first comparing palliative care patients preintervention and postintervention. Second, a matched cohort design enabled comparisons to be made between similar patients who did and did not receive the intervention. Clinically, we examined changes in symptom status preintervention and postintervention as well as adoption of palliative care consultation recommendations by attending physicians.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "California Pacific Medical Center's Palliative Care Consultation Service", "text": "California Pacific Medical Center's (CPMC) Palliative Care Consultation Service (PCCS) began in 2004 with a team comprised of a nurse practitioner, a palliative care-certified physician, a health psychologist, social workers, a chaplain, and an oncology clinical nurse specialist (CNS). In 2005, another full-time palliative care physician joined the team. Potential palliative care patients were identified as those with a combination of (1) an end-stage medical diagnoses;\n(2) failing or reduced effectiveness of nonpalliative treatment of a primary disease process; and (3) a recent decline in functional or nutritional status.\nEligible patients were then referred to the palliative care team by physicians from disciplines throughout the hospital. Consultations included: (1) an evaluation and discussion of patient goals of care, (2) the identification of a health care decision-maker; (3) a symptom assessment including but not limited to pain, dyspnea, depression, and anxiety; (4) a review of the current treatment plan; (5) recommendations for changes in treatment; (6) referrals to social services and spiritual support, as needed; and (7) a review of advanced directives and discussion with patient and family. Treatment recommendations were made to the attending physician or nurse practitioner but the attending physician always maintained care of the patient.\nThe goal of the consultation service was to take a holistic perspective in treating patients near the endof-life with a focus on symptom management, especially pain and dyspnea, psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being, disease process education, goal clarification, and contingency planning. The patientcentered care provided the patient and family with the necessary information and education to make informed decisions about end-of-life care.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Economic analyses I: pre-/postpalliative care consultation", "text": "Longitudinal data preconsultation and postconsultation were analyzed using an interrupted time-series design. This method can be used to determine if the observed costs postintervention were less than the costs expected under the assumption of no effect. The method is typically implemented with routines that identify and model autocorrelation such as trends, cycles, and the tendency to remain elevated or depressed after high or low values. This type of analysis improves upon typical methods that rely solely on the mean of the preseries to predict the mean of the postseries. Instead, time series analyses utilize the history of a series to develop predictive models because the expected value of a patterned series may not be its mean. 11 Nine days preintervention and postintervention were included in the analysis for patients with a hospital length of stay (LOS) of 18 days or less. While more data points were available, fewer patients were represented in data points farther from the intervention point. In addition, the limitation to a narrower time frame reduced case mix bias.\nThe analysis proceeded through the following steps. The autocorrelation identified in the cost data was modeled using Auto Regressive, Integrated, Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling, 12 which allows any of a large group of possible models to be empirically fit to a time series. A binary variable, scored 0 for costs that occurred after the intervention and 1 for costs incurred prior to the intervention, was added to the model. The estimated coefficients for the intervention variable were net of autocorrelation.\nHospital administrative claims data were linked to Trendstar \u00ae cost-accounting data to simultaneously collect clinical and financial data for these analyses. The first 2 days of inpatient care were excluded for all patients, because this is when high-cost surgeries typically occur, potentially resulting in an inflated costsavings estimate.\nPatients with zero costs preconsultation or postconsultation were also eliminated from the analyses after examining them separately and finding no difference in results. Both total and direct costs and charges were included in the analyses.\nThe calculation of cost savings was achieved by tak-ing the difference of the mean daily postconsultation total cost and the overall mean daily total costs and multiplying the result by the number of patient-days in the postconsultation period. This estimate of savings per case was then multiplied by the average annual palliative care census. This is a conservative estimate and uses the overall mean daily costs rather than the often used pre-period daily costs in an attempt to account for trending downward costs over the course of an admission.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Economic analysis II: matched cohort analysis", "text": "Patients who received a palliative care consultation (intervention group) were retrospectively matched with similar patients who did not receive a consultation (comparison group).

The limitation to patients with a length of stay of 18 days or less did reduce variance attributed to a heterogeneous case mix. Application of the additional exclusion criteria did not alter the study results. Table 1 describes the study participants.\nPatients receiving a palliative care consultation had a mean age of 66 years and close to half were female. Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payors for 51% and 9% or the study participants, respectively. Mean hospital LOS was 9.0 days. Nearly 80% of participants fell into the middle range (moderate or major) of APR-DRG Severity of Illness and 85% had an APR-DRG Risk of Mortality greater than one (mild) on a 4-point scale. Twenty-five percent of patients expired before leaving the hospital. Another 22% went home and 18% were discharged to an in-house skilled nursing facility (SNF).\nNearly 40% of patients were referred to the palliative care consultation service by a hospitalist. The average time from admission to palliative care referral CIEMINS ET AL. 1350  Figure 1 illustrates these reductions in ALOS following a palliative care consultation with an overall reduction in ALOS of 11 days.\nApplying the time series design resulted in parameter estimates shown in Table 2. The dependant variable, the mean daily cost of care, was determined to be stationary through 24 lags, indicating a lack of secular trends in the series. The Box-Jenkins analysis revealed a tendency for high or low values to be followed a day later by similar peaks or valleys. A moving-average parameter was therefore included at lag 1.\nEquation 1 shows the best fitting ARIMA model for the series:\nY Mdc \u03ed 2981.6 \u03ea 847.6I \u03e9 (1 \u03ea .5431B 1 )\u2423 t (EQ1)\nwhere Y Mdc \u03ed dependent variable (i.e., the mean daily costs for palliative care patients); I \u03ed binomial intervention variable coded '1' in the pre-period and '0' in the post-period; \u2423 t \u03ed values that cannot be predicted from the history of the series (error term at Day t); B 1 \u03ed value of the series at Time t \u03ea 1, or Lag 1. All parameters were at least twice their standard errors. The association between a palliative care consultation and decreased mean daily costs following the consultation was statistically significant.\nFigure 2 is a graph of the observed mean daily costs preconsultation and postconsultation. While costs are trending downward over time, there is a clear level shift down immediately following the palliative care consultation. A decrease of $892 or 33% in the average total cost per day post palliative care consultation was observed. The variation in costs was also reduced significantly. In addition to the significant intervention variable included in the model, the decreasing costs postintervention were further validated by the identification of a significant level-shift outlier (p \u03fd 0.01, one-tailed test) one day following the intervention.\nThe median LOS dictated that we use the shortest time-series of preconsultation costs that allowed for use of the t statistic for modeling autocorrelation (i.e., 18 days).\nUse of a narrow time period also reduced case mix variation in the series. We repeated the tests using 30, 60, and 90 days and found similar results. Explanations for the significant reductions in costs following a palliative care consultation include the establishment and implementation of patients' goals of care. An independent chart review was conducted that found 80% of the palliative care consultation team's recommendations were accepted and implemented by the attending physician. This finding is further supported by an examination of patient charge descriptions before and after a consultation. Patients had significantly fewer charges associated with services in the ICU or CCU (p \u03fd 0.01). In addition, patients had significantly more charges attributed to pharmacy and physical and occupational therapies. These shifts in charge descriptions correspond with patients shifting focus to pain and symptom management from aggressive curative therapies.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Economic analysis II: matched cohort analysis", "text": "After matching, there were 27 intervention patients and 128 comparison patients available for analysis.

Although a simple comparison of means preconsultation and postconsultation results in an apparent reduction in costs, it does not account for trends in costs over time, such as the decreasing costs typical over the course of a hospital admission. The applied method of analysis ensures that the study findings cannot be attributed to trends, seasonality, other cycles, or the tendency of the time series to remain elevated or depressed after high or low values. All of these forms of autocorrelation were identified and controlled for in these data. Outliers, other than those associated with the palliative care consultation, were identified and controlled for and did not distort the findings. California Pacific Medical Center's palliative care consultation service was successful in decreasing daily costs of inpatient care as demonstrated in these analyses. Our findings demonstrated a significant decrease in costs following a palliative care con-sultation translating to an annual cost savings of $2.2 million. This represents a conservative estimate calculated by taking the total cost savings per case in the post-period and multiplying it by the average annual palliative care census. (See Methods section for detailed description of cost savings calculations.) Costs were reduced as a result of establishing and implementing patients' goals of care as demonstrated by an independent chart review and supported by shifts in costs following a consultation associated with shifts in unit type, e.g., decreased days in the ICU, and increased use of pharmacy and physical and occupational therapies. The time-series analysis was complemented with a retrospective matched cohort analysis. Results from this analysis could not be attributed to decreasing costs over time since both the intervention and comparison cohorts would be susceptible to such trends.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ECONOMIC AND CLINICAL IMPACT OF INPATIENT PALLIATIVE", "text": "Both economic analyses were further complemented by the inclusion of several important clinical findings. Patients receiving a palliative care consultation experienced significant improvements in their symptom status in the areas of pain, dyspnea and secretions.\nAn important finding in this study was the reduction in average time to palliative care consultation referral from 14 days in 2004 to 7 days in 2006 representing a 50% reduction. This demonstrated reduction in time to referral was paramount in reducing the overall ALOS for these patients, which decreased from 24 days in 2004 to 13 days in 2006. The earlier patients received a consultation, the earlier goals of care and appropriate treatment plans could be established. In turn, this reduced ALOS ultimately resulted in reductions in the total cost of an admission. Although many factors may contribute to declining ALOS over time, at an average daily total cost of $2,238 for palliative care patients, annual cost savings could reach $14 million.\nThis study was limited by several important factors. First, patients had a wide range of hospital length of stays resulting in quite a mix of cases at any given point in the time series. This issue was addressed by limiting the study to patients with a maximum length of stay of 18 days. This ensured that mean values in the data series represented patients at similar points in their hospital stay. In addition, series of varying lengths were modeled; results remained consistent.\nSecond, due to the diagnostically diverse patient population we were unable to stratify by additional variables in order to identify potential varying effects among patient sub-populations. In other words, we were unable to verify whether patients representing a few diagnostic groups, presumably those most associated with high-cost procedures, were primarily responsible for the observed cost reductions. This problem was only slightly mitigated by the matched cohort analysis that was limited to cancer patients. While this diagnostic group demonstrated lower costs when receiving a palliative care consultation, the cancer patients included in this analysis represented a small percentage of the entire patient population.\nOur finding that palliative care consultation is associated with reduced hospital costs supports the need for further research and policy studies. Further inves-tigation is warranted to parse out the individual factors influencing cost reductions and the identification of patient sub-populations most impacted by these programs. Randomized clinical trials of palliative care would provide a more definitive test of the clinical and financial benefits.

In 1995, Serlin and colleagues developed a technique to establish the cut points for mild, moderate, and severe pain by grading pain intensity with functional interference. Since then, a number of studies attempted to confirm these findings in similar or different populations but had different results. Such inconsistencies in the literature prompt for more research to establish the definition of mild, moderate and severe pain. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to identify optimal cut points (CP) of the three pain severity categories for worst, average, and current pain. Patients and methods: The study population (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 199) was patients with symptomatic bone metastases referred to a palliative radiotherapy clinic. Using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), patients reported their worst, average, and current pain intensity, as well as the degree of functional interference due to pain. All possible combinations for the CPs, between 2 and 8, were created and related to the set of 7 interference items from the BPI using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The criteria used to determine the optimal set of cut points for mild, moderate and severe pain was a MANOVA among pain severity categories that yielded the largest F ratio for the between-category effect on the 7 interference items as indicated by Pillai's trace, Wilk's , and Hotelling's trace F statistics. Results: Results confirmed a non-linear relationship between cancer pain severity and functional interference. The optimal CP for worst and average pain was CP4, 6 (mild \u202b\u060d\u202c 1-4, moderate \u202b\u060d\u202c 5-6, and severe \u202b\u060d\u202c 7-10), confirming Serlin and colleagues's findings. Conclusion: These findings are pivotal in further understanding the meaning of pain intensity levels and the assessment of pain in patients with metastatic cancer. However, further research in alternative methods of defining the optimal CP and clinically important change should be considered.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "P AIN is one of the most common and distressing symptoms that patients with advanced cancer experience. Unrelieved pain can disrupt and interfere with many activities of daily living, quality of life, and mood. [1][2][3] Valid pain assessment tools are required to adequately evaluate pain intensity and the effectiveness of the pain management plan. 4 Commonly used scales to assess this construct include visual analogue scales (VAS), verbal descriptor scales (VDS), or numeric rating scales (NRS). The VAS is a 10-cm line with ends of \"no pain\" and \"pain as bad as it could be\" on which patients can mark their pain intensity; Department of Radiation Oncology, Odette Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nthe VDS contains a list of adjectives that describe levels of pain (i.e., no pain, mild, moderate, or severe pain); and the NRS allows patients to describe the intensity of pain in numbers. For example, NRS may use an 11-point scale where 0 indicates no pain and 10 represents worst possible pain. Numerical scales are also frequently used for measuring changes in pain over time and correlating pain intensity with other important outcomes, such as quality of life or functional interference. All three pain-rating scales are valid, reliable, and appropriate for use in studies and clinical practice. 5 However, NRS are often most used in clinical trials for several reasons. First, VDS usually include only four to five descriptors and may be too crude for research purposes. 5 Second, although the VAS is statistically most robust because it provides ratio level data, it is often difficult to use in clinical practice. It was found that the NRS has higher reliability than the VAS and VRS in a study of literate and illiterate patients with rheumatoid arthritis 6 and that the success in completing a VAS declined with age. 7 Evidence from two critical reviews by McDowell 5 and Williamson 8 suggest that the numerical rating scale is the most useful of the three types.\nTo date, a number of studies have attempted to establish cut points for mild, moderate and severe pain on a numeric scale. Such investigations are important for several reasons, as outlined by Anderson. 9 Most patients prefer to describe their pain severity using verbal rating scales such as mild, moderate or severe when communicating with healthcare providers. 10 However, some current clinical practice guidelines for cancer pain, such as the World Health Organization analgesic ladder 11 are based on the assessment of pain using categorical scales (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe), while others, such as the American Pain Society Cancer Pain Guidelines 12 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Centre Network guidelines 13 are based on both categorical and numerical pain scales. A lack of consensus as to what these pain categories mean numerically may result in difficulty for clinicians to interpret and follow treatment guidelines. The categorization of pain into three grades help clinical research studies to summarize the prevalence of different levels of pain intensity within a population (for example, the number of patients experiencing an increase of pain from mild to moderate). To compare results across studies, consistent definitions of mild, moderate and severe pain are required.\nIn 1995, Serlin et al. 14 began an investigation of grading mild, moderate and severe pain on a numeric scale using a novel multivariate statistical approach. Using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) responses of over 1800 patients with cancer-related pain from four countries, it was found that the optimal upper cut point for mild and moderate pain was 4 and 6, respectively. A nonlinear relation between pain severity and functional interference was also observed. Subsequent studies with other populations and origin of pain using the same method were conducted. However, pain severity cut points were inconsistent across studies, where the upper boundary for mild and moderate pain varied between 3 to 5, and 6 to 8, respectively.\nThe purpose of the current study was to identify the optimal cut points for mild, moderate and severe pain in patients with pain from bone metastases, and to confirm findings with previous studies. A secondary objective was to examine if worst, average or current pain is a more suitable measure for the conversion of numeric pain scores to categories of mild, moderate, and severe.", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "This study was a secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal study (submitted for review) that examined the effectiveness of palliative radiotherapy on alleviating the severity of pain and functional interference.

Ethics approval for the current study was obtained from the Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre.\nAt initial consultation, patient demographics including the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and symptom profile from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were obtained by the investigators. Using the BPI, patients rated their worst, average and current pain intensity on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine), as well as the level of pain interference with seven items of function: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale of 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference). The BPI has been validated across various populations and shown to be reliable in measuring pain intensity and interference with function. 15 Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were generated for the patients' demographic and disease-related characteristics.

The question of whether the cut points differ between the three pain scales was also explored. Using the MANOVA procedure as described by Serlin et al. 14 we found that mild pain was best categorized as scores between 1 to 4, moderate pain as 5 to 6, and severe pain as 7 to 10 for both worst and average pain. Our cut points matched those as presented by Serlin et al. 14 with cancer pain, Jensen et al. 17 with back pain, Turner et al. 18 with pain from low-back injuries, and Mendoza et al. 19 with pain from coronary artery bypass grafting. However, we did not match the cut points for pain originating from bone metastases in a similar study conducted by Paul et al. 20 and Chow et al., 21 nor those with other non-cancer pain, such as in the general population patients with osteoarthritic pain 22 and lower back pain, 23 pain from carpal tunnel syndrome, 18 from phantom limb pain, 17 from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 24 from spinal cord injury, 25 or postoperative pain. 26,27 Table 5 summarizes studies conducted on cut points for mild, moderate and severe pain to date.\nCut points for current pain have not been well studied in the literature, as most trials focus on worst and average pain. In this study, we investigated if current pain yielded the same cut points as worst and average pain. We found that the classification was not the same, where mild pain severity was found to range from 1 to 2, and moderate pain from 3 to 6. Such differences are likely associated with the poor relationship between current pain and functional interference. 28 For example, although a patient rates his/her current pain intensity as mild (perhaps because he/she is at rest or had just taken analgesics), he or she is likely to score the highest or average degree of interference experienced over the time period as specified in the question.\nThe secondary objective was to examine if worst, average or current pain is a more suitable measure for the conversion of numeric pain scores to categories of OPTIMAL CUT POINTS FOR MILD, MODERATE, AND SEVERE PAIN 1343  mild, moderate and severe. As stated earlier, the largest F ratio for the between-category effect on the 7 interference items defined the optimal cut point. Following the same approach, we can establish whether worst, average or current pain is a better scale for categorizing pain intensity. In our analysis, the optimal cut cpoint F ratios for worst pain was about three times that of average pain, and four times that of current pain. This suggests that worst pain may be a better measure for the conversion of numeric pain scores to categories. Further analysis using post hoc contrasts was done to determine if functional interference scores were significantly different between the pain severity categories. Our analysis showed that mean scores from 4 of 7 items of functional interference between the mild and moderate pain groups were not statistically different. This illustrates that the relationship between pain severity and functional interference is non-linear. For example, in this study, the mean interference score for general activity remained quite low in the mild and moderate pain groups (mean \u03ed 2.53, SD \u03ed 3.00; and 3.96, SD \u03ed 3.13) but is dramatically higher in the severe pain group (mean \u03ed 7.90, SD \u03ed 2.41). This suggests that at lower levels of pain (mild to moderate), function is not seriously impaired until the pain severity passes a certain threshold. Our findings confirm a nonlinear relationship between pain severity and function also observed in other studies. 14,17,20 This study is subject to a number of limitations. First, the outcomes were subjective and self-reported measures, which may explain the variation of cut points among the studies. Future work can focus on associating pain intensity with other types of data, such as objective measures of function (walking ability measured by distance or time, etc.). Second, patients in this study were recruited from a palliative radiotherapy clinic and approximately 78% (n \u03ed 155) rated their pain between 7 and 10 (severe category). As a result of the low number of patients with pain intensity of 1-6, the observed cut point may be inaccurate and does not represent the one with a larger sample size. Despite such limitations, our study demonstrated and confirmed that the cut points on the worst and average pain scale in patients with metastatic cancer were 4 and 6.\nSEVERE PAIN Serlin Paul Chow Turner Mendoza Zelman\nThe classification of discrete pain categories is valuable for clinical evaluation, research and public policy.

Methods: The study group was 2868 consecutive patients who had their PC1 during a 30-month period.

Therefore, palliative care programs have been developed to fill this gap in care for patients with advanced disease.\nMost referrals to palliative care services occur late in the disease process. 2 Many authors [5][6][7][8][9][10] have criticized the timing of palliative care and hospice refer- rals because of the limited time available for these services to achieve their goals. 2 The purpose of this study was to determine the time interval between the first palliative care consult (PC1) and death (D) in patients diagnosed with advanced cancer at our comprehensive cancer center and to determine whether this interval has experienced any lengthening over time as a sign of progressive adoption of our palliative care services by the referring physicians.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": "We reviewed the charts of 3142 consecutive patients who were seen for the first time in any of the palliative care settings (inpatient, outpatient) at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) during the period April 2003 and September 2005. The first date was chosen to ascertain that all charts would be available on the hospital network and avoid the manual review of the original paper charts. The second date was chosen to ascertain the majority of the dates of death would be confirmed on the Social Security Death Index Interactive Search (SSDIS) by the time we started the data collection (September 2006). Inclusion criteria were: patients diagnosed with aCA at our center after October 1999; patients had their PC1 between April 2003 and September 2005; patients' death related to their aCA.\nPatients who did not meet the three inclusion criteria were excluded from the final analysis. The data collection team consisted of the primary investigator (physician specialized in palliative medicine), four research nurses, and one student. The primary investigator trained the different team members on data collection. In all cases where a team member had a difficulty identifying a specific date, the primary investigator conducted an independent chart review and reached consensus regarding the date with the team member. In addition, the primary investigator reviewed approximately 2100 charts for the purpose of quality control and evaluation of the members of the research team. The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Board Review approved the study.\nInformation pertinent to the patients' demographic features (age at the first palliative care consult, gender, and ethnicity), the cancer responsible of their death (location and type), the date of cancer diagnosis, the date of advanced cancer diagnosis at MDACC, the date of first palliative care consult, and the date of death were collected from the electronic medical records. Advanced cancer was defined as locally recurrent or metastatic for solid cancers and as first re-lapse for hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma). In the case of locally progressive solid cancer (with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis) or progressive hematological malignancy (with no evidence of relapse), patients who were referred to the phase 1 program, patients who refused all curative treatments, and patients who according to the notes of their oncologist had an incurable (or refractory) cancer or were not eligible for treatment despite possible cure (e.g., low performance status or comorbidities) were considered as having advanced disease at the time of the oncologist decision documentation. In the case of patients with multiple malignancies, data were collected for the cancer responsible of the patient's death.\nDescriptive statistics were used to quantify patients' demographics, disease features, and different time intervals. Intervals between cancer diagnosis to death (CA-D), advanced cancer diagnosis to death (aCA-D), advanced cancer diagnosis to first palliative care consult (aCA-PC1), first palliative care consult to death (PC1-D), and the ratio of PC1-D/aCA-D were summarized with survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method. Intervals of time for female versus male patients, patients less than 65 versus 65 years old or older, patients with liquid versus solid tumors, and patients' ethnicity (white versus nonwhite) were compared using the log-rank test of equality over strata. Ninetyfive percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the median length of time of each interval.

Patients characteristics are summarized in Table 1: 1404 patients (49%) were female, 1791 (62%) were less than 65 years old, 2563 (89%) had solid tumor, and 2004 (70%) were white. The median age of patients was 60 years.\nThe median (95% CI) CA-D, aCA-D, aCA-PC1, and PC1-D intervals for all patients were 570 EL OSTA ET AL. 52 (529-596), 250 (235-265), 147 (134-161), and 42 (38-46) days respectively (Table 2).\nTable 3 and Figure 1 summarize the change in PC1-D intervals over time. The median PC1-D interval decreased significantly in the 5 consecutive half-year periods (p \u03ed 0.02). The aCA-D interval did not change significantly over time. The PC1-D/aCA-D ratio expresses the percentage of the interval between the diagnosis of advanced cancer and death during which the patient received palliative care. This ratio decreased significantly (p \u03ed 0.0004), mostly as a result of a decrease of the PC1-D interval (p \u03ed 0.02). The number of patients who accessed palliative care during this period increased from 544 to 654 (20%).\nFigure 2 show that the PC1-D interval was significantly longer for patients with solid tumors (p \u03fd 0.0001), age less than 65 years old (p \u03ed 0.002), and fe-males (p \u03ed 0.004).

This interval remained short and has not improved over time. We also found that pa-tients with solid tumor, younger patients, and female patients had earlier access to acute palliative care. The access timing was not affected by the ethnicity.\nThe median PC1-D interval in patients with solid tumors was more than three times longer than in patients with liquid tumors. Patients with liquid tumors were found to have a significantly longer aCA-D interval compared to patients with solid tumors (p \u03ed 0.0001). There are a number of possible explanations for these differences. Patients with hematologic malignancies have lower frequency of major pain syndromes, cachexia, and other sentinel symptoms [11][12][13][14] and have more treatments available that remain a viable option despite their advanced disease. 2,11,15 In EL OSTA ET AL. 54 addition, there are no reliable indicators of refractory disease. These patients are reported by many authors 11,12,15,16 to die more frequently in acute care facilities compared to patients with solid tumors. In a study addressing the place of death and its predictors for patients registered at our cancer center during the 1997-1998 fiscal year, our group found that hematologic malignancies was the highest predictor of death in the hospital (odds ratio [OR] \u03ed 4.4; p \u03fd 0.0001), followed by black ethnicity (OR \u03ed 1.9; p \u03fd 0.001) and non-Medicare coverage. 12 Higginson et al. 15 reported similar findings in a 10-year analysis over 1.3 million cancer deaths in the United Kingdom: they observed less patients with liquid tumors dying at home (16%) compared to other cancers excluding breast (29%). Limited communication between palliative care team and hematology oncologists as well resistance to adopt palliative care services in their patient's plan of care could lead to this significant difference in time and number of consultations. In order to lengthen the PC1-D interval in patients with hematologic malignancies, it will be important to develop palliative care programs specifically targeted to the needs of these patients. These programs have to consider providing needs such as transfusion therapy or chemotherapy.\nOur hypothesis was that increased awareness and access to our palliative care service over time would result in earlier access to palliative care (APC), thereby increasing the PC1-D interval. Our findings suggest that this has not occurred at our cancer center and that the lack of earlier APC was consistent among different services and cancer groups. The increase in the overall number of new consults (20%) was accompanied by a significant decrease in PC1-D interval for most patients (p \u03ed 0.02). The decrease was significant for patients with head, neck, thoracic, and gynecologic malignancies (p \u03ed 0.01 and p \u03ed 0.02, respectively). The nonsignificant trend toward decrease in the other cancer groups may be due to the small number of consultations. Previous studies have shown that physicians who are familiar with palliative care services would have a tendency to refer patients earlier compared to newer physicians with limited palliative care experience 6,17 and hematologists. 18 In our observation, all referring physicians had the same tendency towards late referrals (p \u03ed 0.74) despite similar median survival in patients with solid and liquid tumors (p \u03ed 0.051).\nAt our cancer center, the palliative care department is involved in the care of advanced cancer patients whether they are receiving chemotherapy and/or other cancer treatments or not. Therefore, experimental interventions such as given in the phase 1 program at our center should not delay the first palliative care consult. Rickerson et al. 19 conducted a prospective study in which they assessed the anticipated helpfulness of hospice services and the actual helpfulness of the same services. They found that patients and their families benefited from hospice for a short period of time, mainly at the last days of life. 19,20 However, families felt they received greater benefits from longer lengths of stay in hospice (p \u03fd 0.001).", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PALLIATIVE CARE TO DEATH INTERVAL 55 FIG. 2.

They found that the first group of patients was referred earlier to hospice, had a longer median LOS in hospice (35 versus 21 days, p \u03ed 0.02) and a higher median palliative performance status (45 versus 40, p \u03ed 0.009). The performance status was the main predictor of the LOS in hospice (OR \u03ed 1.40). Unfortunately, we did not use such tool in our assessment during the period of the study. Therefore, it is impossible for us in this retrospective study to analyze the performance status impact on the timing of the first palliative care consult. The performance status may have been a confounder in the interpretation of our data. Future research determining the performance status impact on acute palliative care access is needed.\nOur group conducted a retrospective chart review of 340 consecutive patients with advanced cancer who accessed our palliative care program between September and December 2003. 2 Among these patients, 234 had their time of death confirmed in the hospital tumor registry. We found that the median time intervals aCA-D and PC1-D were 286 days (95% CI: 240-338) and 58 days (95% CI: 49-67), respectively. Patients with liquid tumors and younger patients had longer PC1-D interval (p \u03fd 0.001 and p \u03ed 0.03, respectively). Gender and ethnicity did not have any impact on this interval (p \u03ed 0.81 and p \u03ed 0.80, respectively).\nUnlike our previous study, this comprehensive chart review was able to determine the impact of gender on the timing of the first palliative care consultation for patients with advanced cancer. This study's results confirm that PC1 is still occurring late in the trajectory of the disease and that for the same period of time (end of 2003) the PC1-D was similar to that found in our previous study (56  versus 58 [49-67] days, respectively). However, further follow-up has shown that there was a trend toward decrease in the PC1-D interval during the following period. The ma-jor limitation of this study is its retrospective design. The date of advanced cancer for each patient was collected by many persons rather than one person. Nevertheless, the teaching sessions before the data collection, the weekly follow-ups, and the comprehensive review by the principal investigator helped in streaming the data. It is impossible to know the reasons for late APC: reasons related to referring physicians or changes in palliative care fellows. The latter is unlikely because of the close supervision of our palliative care specialists. It is also difficult to determine from the chart whether patients with early access to palliative care achieved better overall symptom control compared to those with later access.\nAfter 30 months of follow-up, 8% of the data was censored and only 3% of patients were lost follow-up and therefore it is unlikely that longer follow-ups would result in significant change in our data.\nOur data may not be generalized to other cancer centers.

Methods: We studied the records of consecutive patients with hematologic and solid malignancies at their first palliative care consultation (PC1). We collected information about demographics, cancer type, date of PC1, and the interval from PC1 to death (PC1-D). We reviewed the charts for the Edmonton Symptoms Assessment System (ESAS) and presence of delirium. Results: We included 250 patients (125 with each type of malignancy).

[1][2][3][4] For example, Maddocks et al. 1 compared the final month of life of patients with acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and colorectal cancer. Despite the similar symptom burdens in the three groups, all patients with leukemia died in the hospital and fewer had access to palliative care than did those in the other two groups. 1 Our group previ-ously showed that the diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy is a major predictor of low APCS 2 and that the median time between the first palliative care consultation and death (PC1-D) was 14 days for patients with hematologic compared to 48 days in those with solid malignancies, which indicates that these patients have a later APCS. 3,5 The reasons for this reduced and late APCS in patients with hematologic malignancies are not well understood. Previous researchers have identified some contributing factors, including the curable nature of the illness and the availability of therapies in the advanced stages, [6][7][8] the acute nature of speed of the patient's decline, 8,9 and the difficulties in prognostication. [10][11][12][13] In addition, physicians' and patients' related factors such as concerns of loss of hope also have been described. 12,13 Furthermore, it is unclear whether these patients develop a high symptom burden at the end of life that requires specialist palliative care interventions. 1,14 The purposes of this study, therefore, were to determine whether symptom severity is lower in patients with hematologic malignancies on APCS than it is in those with solid tumors and whether symptom severity is associated with a longer PC1-D. To do this, we conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with both types of malignancies who had been referred to the palliative care service at our comprehensive cancer center during a 12-month period.", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PATIENTS AND METHODS", "text": "We reviewed our computerized database to identify all patients with hematologic or solid malignancies who were seen for the first time in either of the palliative care settings (i.e., inpatient, outpatient) at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from October 2004 through September 2005. Our Institutional Review Board approved the study.\nAt M. D. Anderson, patients are seen by a palliative care physician in the mobile consultation team or the ambulatory treatment center, upon request by the treating oncologist, to help with symptom management and/or to facilitate disposition to hospice care. 15 Patients with severe symptoms or with significant psychological or family distress who require an interdisciplinary team approach are transferred to the Palliative Care Unit under the primary care of one of the palliative care physicians. 16 The palliative care consultation service evaluates the severity of patients' symptoms by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) 17 and specifically for delirium by using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). 18 The ESAS measures the patients response to ten common symptoms in the past 24 hours (pain, fatigue, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, and shortness of breath, appetite, sleep, and feeling of well being) in patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses. [19][20][21] The ESAS has been validated in patients with cancer with hematologic as well as solid malignancies. 17 This instrument showed good internal consistency and correlated well with corresponding measures from other tools such as the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale and the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy. 22 Delirium is a common syndrome in advanced cancer patients with an incidence that approaches 85% closer to the end of life. [23][24][25] This syndrome is frequently undiagnosed and under recognized and requires a high index of suspicion. 26 Therefore, our palliative care specialists routinely conduct and document in the chart a structured assessment of delirium based on the MMSE score and followed by a formal interview according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria. 27 We collected the following information from the electronic medical records: patients' demographic characteristics (age at the first palliative care consultation [PC1], gender, and ethnicity), the cancer type directly responsible for their death, the date of the PC1, the date of death, their symptom scores on the ESAS, and presence of delirium at PC1. The sum of each patient's symptom scores was considered the symptom distress score (SDS). 17 We classified patients into one of two groups according to the type of malignancy directly responsible for their death: hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome, and solid tumors.\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic characteristics, cancer type, the PC1-D, and the results of baseline symptom assessments (i.e., individual symptoms on the ESAS) in each group of patients. The presence of delirium in each group was compared with the 2 test. The average scores for age, individual symptoms on the ESAS, and the PC1-D in the two groups were compared using Wilcoxon's Rank Sum test for difference in medians. A p value of \u03fd0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.

We included 250 patients in this study: the last 125 consecutive patients with hematologic and the last 125 consecutive patients with solid malignancies. Due to the reduced number of hematologic compared to solid malignancy patients who were referred to palliative care, the enrolling time for hematologic patients was 8 months and for solid malignancy patients was 2 months.\nTable 1 summarizes their demographic characteristics and the type of malignancy. We found no differences in age, gender, or ethnicity between the two groups.\nTable 2 summarizes the symptom severity in both groups. The median (95% confidence interval [CI]) pain scores were 4 (3-5) for those with hematologic and 5 (4-6) for those with solid malignancies (p \u03ed 0.043). The median (95% CI) drowsiness scores were 7 (5-10) and 5 (3)(4)(5)(6) for the two groups, respectively (p \u03ed 0.0008). There was no significant difference in all other symptoms on the ESAS.

We found no association between symptom severity and the PC1-D interval. Our study also showed that although the symptoms in the two groups of patients differed slightly in nature, they were similarly severe. Although the intensity of pain was statistically significantly lower in patients with hematologic than in those with solid malignancies, the difference of 1 point on a 0-10 scale (less than a 20% difference) is not usually considered clinically significant. 28  Patients with hematologic malignancies were more likely to be drowsy and confused than were patients with solid malignancies. Therefore, we believe that palliative care specialists need to be particularly vigilant about treating symptoms of drowsiness and delirium in these patients. Unfortunately due to the retrospective nature of the study we were not able to determine the factors contributing to the high incidence of delirium in these patients. The etiology of this syndrome is usually multifactorial including medications, infections, electrolyte abnormalities, brain metastasis and cytokines release. [29][30][31] Another possible explanation for the high incidence of delirium in hematologic malignancy patients in our study is that these patients were at a later stage of their illness at the time of APCS, since delirium is more common near the end of life. 32 Future research should be aimed at determining the incidence as well as the etiology of delirium in these patients.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "FADUL ET AL. 424", "text": "The survival of patients with hematologic malignancies, a median of 13 days, was about one third of that in patients with solid tumors at the time of APCS. This finding suggests that end-of-life discussions should be accelerated in patients with hematologic malignancies on their referral to palliative care services. Furthermore, the short length of survival of these patients from the time of APCS combined with the fact that they are likely to be confused and unable to make end-of-life decisions further suggest that their caregivers are experiencing a considerable amount of distress and therefore require extensive counseling and anticipatory bereavement support. The reasons for the late APCS in these patients are not well understood. Other studies suggested that the high-tech needs of these patients such as blood transfusions, which are not usually provided in hospice services, can play a role. 33,34 However, due to the acute nature of our inpatient palliative care unit where these treatments are readily available 16 it is likely that this had a lower impact on APCS at our institution.\nOur findings agree with those reported by Cheng et al. 3 that younger patients with solid tumors are more likely than older patients to be referred early for palliative care. We found no correlation between early referral to palliative care and symptom severity in either group. This raises the possibility that strategies aimed at increasing early APCS should place greater emphasis on advance care planning than on early symptom control.\nThis study showed that the symptom burden was high on referral to palliative care regardless of the PC1-D interval, but this does not necessarily mean that hematologists and oncologists under recognize ongoing distress in these patients. Since one of the major reasons for referral to palliative care at our institution is interactable symptoms, 15 it is possible that these patients were referred to palliative care primarily because of their high level of distress and that those who were not referred had a lower symptom burden. This is an important area that will need to be addressed in prospective longitudinal studies.\nFurthermore, our study did not attempt to determine the symptom burden throughout the illness trajectory in these populations. The only way to determine this accurately is to conduct a study prospectively in consecutive patients with solid and hematologic malignancies and compare the symptom burden at different points during their illness trajectory. This is an important area that future research should focus on in an attempt to identify opportunities for referral of these patients to palliative care services. In addition, it might be difficult to compare these two groups of patients because of the inherent differences in their illness trajectories and therapeutic strategies resulting in different end of life experiences. These differences are important to consider in future research when comparing these two groups of patients. Future research should also attempt to identify models of care that are capable of addressing the specific needs of patients with hematologic malignancies to provide earlier APCS.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of our data collection and analysis is itself a limitation. Second, we collected the data for only patients who had been referred to the palliative care service, and this might not be representative of other patients in both groups. However, this structured level of symptom assessment utilizing the ESAS and the MMSE is not available to all patients at our institution and therefore it will be hard to gather these data. Finally, the enrolling time for hematologic patient was longer than that for solid tumors that could have led to a change in attitudes of physicians toward patients with hematologic and solid malignancies.\nIn conclusion, the symptom severity was as high in patients with hematologic malignancies at the time of their referral to palliative care services as it was in patients with solid tumors and did not correlate with early APCS. As a result, we urge the development of palliative care models that identify and address the specific needs of patients with hematologic malignancies.

Objective: We conducted a qualitative study to examine the perspectives of patients, family, physicians, and nurses on the simultaneous need for supporting hope and discussing prognosis. Methods: We conducted in-depth longitudinal qualitative interviews with patients with either advanced cancer or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), along with their family, physicians, and nurses. We used principles of grounded theory to analyze the transcripts and evaluated a conceptual model with four diagrams depicting different types of approaches to hope and prognostic information. Results: We interviewed 55 patients, 36 family members, 31 physicians, and 25 nurses representing 220 hours of interviews. Asking patients directly \"how much information\" they wanted was, by itself, not useful for identifying information needs, but in-depth questioning identified variability in patients' and family members' desires for explicit prognostic information. All but 2 patients endorsed at least one of the diagrams concerning the interaction of hope and prognostic information and some patients described moving from one diagram to another over the course of their illness. Respondents also described two different approaches to communication about prognosis based on the diagram selected: two of the four diagrams suggested a direct approach and the other two suggested a cautious, indirect approach. Conclusions: This study found important variability in the ways different patients with life-limiting illnesses approach the interaction of wanting support for hope and prognostic information from their clinicians. The four-diagram approach may help clinicians understand individual patients and families, but further research is needed to determine the utility of these diagrams for improving communication about end-of-life care 610    ", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A TERMINAL OR LIFE-LIMITING DIAGNOSIS is intensely stressful for patients and families and evokes emotions as diverse as fear, anxiety, anger, depression, and helplessness. 1 One of the most common and important responses to a terminal diagnosis is hope. 2,3 The therapeutic value of hope is well established. [4][5][6] Hope helps patients emotionally endure crises 7 and some studies have shown that hopeful patients follow treatment recommendations and tolerate discomfort better than patients who are not hopeful. 8,9 Among patients with cancer, higher levels of hope have been associated with more active involvement in their selfcare 10 and higher levels of psychosocial adjustment. 11 In contrast to hope, hopelessness is associated with depression, 12 suicidal ideation, 13 desire for hastened death 14 and decreased physical health. 15 Despite these associations between hope and better outcomes, it is not known whether specific interventions to improve communication about hope can improve patient and family outcomes.\nAlthough patients with terminal or life-limiting illness value hope highly, the majority also want truthful information about their prognosis. 10,[16][17][18] In focus groups with dying patients and their families and clinicians, honest and straightforward information was paramount among communication needs. 19 However, many physicians report concern that honest information about prognosis can damage patients' hope and, according to physicians, this concern is a leading barrier to discussing end-of-life care. 20,21 Furthermore, dramatic disagreement is often found between patients' and physicians' estimates of prognosis. Patients are more optimistic than their physicians, and physicians' estimates are more accurate. 22 Among candidates for breast cancer adjuvant therapy, 70% of patients overestimated their chance of cure by 20% or more compared to their physician. 23 Among patients with cancer interviewed in another study, two thirds had poor prognoses with no hope of cure, yet only 21% perceived they had a poor prognosis. 24 Such unfounded optimism influences treatment choices. Patients who believe they are going to live for at least 6 months are more likely to favor life-extending treatment compared to patients who believe there is at least a 10% chance that they will not live 6 months. 22 Cumulatively, these data suggest that physicians' inability to balance concerns about providing prognostic information with supporting patients' hope may be an important barrier to communication with patients and families about end-of-life care. Christakis 25 has described how physicians may see their own optimistic presentations of prognosis, as well as the practice of withholding information, as humane ways of preserving hope in their patients. Others also suggest that physicians are often purposely vague or misleading in prognostic estimates they give to dying patients in order to maintain hope. 26,27 Physicians often view optimism about prognosis as the central feature of patients' hope, but there is evidence that this is not true for many patients. 25 Furthermore, there is some evidence that patients are less concerned than physicians about damaged hope. 28 Although there have been recommendations, based on expert opinion, to help patients \"redirect\" their hopes when facing terminal illness, [29][30][31] there has not been research to identify ways to help clinicians, patients, and families integrate support for hope with provision of accurate prognostic information.\nThe goal of this study was to examine the interactions between the desire to have hope supported and the need to receive explicit prognostic information on the part of patients and family members, as well as the desire to support hope and the need to provide prognostic information for the clinicians caring for them, in order to develop insights that might be helpful for clinicians. We used a qualitative study of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or advanced cancer as well as their families, nurses, and physicians to describe these interactions In this paper, we describe an approach to understanding some potential interactions between supporting hope and providing prognostic information and examine a fourdiagram approach that may help clinicians understand patients' perspectives on the interaction between the dual needs for hope and for explicit prognostic information.", "n_publication_ref": 34, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participant recruitment", "text": "A purposive recruitment strategy was used to obtain diversity in participants and identify those with relevant experiences to share, as described below for each participant type.

Some patients differed from their family members in their desire for prognostic information. The wife of a man with cancer said: It's tough and maybe he {the patient} would rather go without knowing that . . . but, I need to know it all . . . I need it to help prepare the children.\nRecognition that patients need an individualized approach to communication. Many participants expressed the importance of individualizing the clinician's approach to hope and prognosis to match the needs of the individual patient and his or her family. Some patients and family qualified their own desire for prognostic information by stating that physicians should be aware of how each individual copes with bad news. A patient with COPD said: Some patients can take that information upfront and some just can't handle it. I think it would depend on the type of person.\nHowever, when asked how clinicians could identify the right approach for individual patients and family, few participants could describe specific clinician behaviors that were helpful. For example, many responded that it would be difficult for clinicians to know the best approach for an individual. A patient said: Every doctor and nurse in the world has the unenviable chore of trying to figure out that one patient; not the patient before; not the patient coming in next; this one person.\nA number of participants suggested that physicians in longstanding relationships with their patients will more easily be able to select the right approach for those patients, although none of these clinician or patient participants named specific behaviors, and relied principally on intuition and time.

This question was framed by saying that people vary in how much information they want. In response, all patients and family members responded that they wanted \"all the information.\" However, in further questioning, a substantial minority of participants made it clear that they did not want explicit information about prognosis such as a median survival, estimated life expectancy, or \"worst case scenario\" and felt that this information could harm them. When a husband was asked how much information he would like about his wife's cancer, he initially said:\nWell, I have to say, I prefer to have all the information. I don't know how everybody else feels, but I would like to know everything. Subsequently, when asked specifically about wanting bad news about prognosis, he said: Well, maybe . . .

I have to take that back, now that you start questioning me.\nThroughout the interviews, we found that simply asking patients how much information they want, without exploring their emotions and concerns, did not adequately elicit informational needs.\nFour-diagram conceptual model. We developed the four diagram approach to help elicit and describe patient and family views about integrating hope and prognosis (Fig. 1). The four diagrams are labeled as follows to reflect their meaning: (A) \"back-forth\" diagram (going back and forth between hopefulness and acknowledging a poor prognosis); (B) \"scales\" diagram (a balance between maintaining hope and acknowledging prognosis); (C) \"yin-yang\" diagram (holding both hope and prognosis simultaneously); and (D) \"redirecting arrow\" diagram (a change from hoping for cure to hoping for other things such as quality of life).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Participant endorsements of the four diagrams.", "text": "Many patients and family members endorsed the com-partmentalized existence of hope and truth without any integration (A: back-forth). These participants described being able to focus on their hopes or think about their prognosis, but not at the same time. Some participants struggled to achieve a balance between these concepts, walking a tightrope between \"too much hope\" (unrealistic expectations) and \"too much truth\" (hopelessness) (B: scales). Some participants described being able to develop a harmonious integration in which they were able to think simultaneously about their hopes and their prognosis (C: yin-yang). Finally, some participants achieved redirection of their hope, moving from a hope for cure to a hope for other things such as quality of life, symptom control, or life closure (D: redirection). Overall, most participants found the four diagram approach credible for summarizing their experiences or the experiences of others. Most patients endorsed one or two diagrams as effectively summarizing their personal approach to living with hope and explicit prognostic information, but some endorsed more than two diagrams. We are unable to formally quantitate this endorsement because we asked participants to discuss each diagram rather than pick the diagram that fit best. Two patients did not endorse any of the diagrams and neither offered an alternative. Table 4 shows representative examples of patient endorsement of each diagram.\nChanges in diagram endorsement over time. Some patients and family members described how their choice of a diagram changed over time with the progression of their illness: That's the progress of the illness. I think you start there {back and forth} the minute you hear {the diagnosis} and you hope for a cure, you hope for a fix. And with the progress of the illness, you hope for, you know, for other things, for a gentle death.\nA patient said: I used to {go back and forth}, a long time ago, when I first heard.

We found that participants described different com-munication approaches, depending on the diagrams they selected. For diagrams A and B, prognostic information was viewed as a threat to hope; participants suggested that physicians should provide prognostic information cautiously and indirectly, in order to avoid negatively affecting patients' hopes. By contrast, participants who selected diagrams C or D preferred more direct approaches to prognostic information; they did not report that receiving prognostic information compromised their hopes. These indirect and direct approaches are discussed below.\nIndirect approach (Diagrams A and B): For patients and families endorsing diagrams A and B, their recommendations suggested that a cautious approach to providing prognostic information might be most helpful. This approach suggests that clinicians take into account the patient's and family's emotional state when discussing prognosis, and cautions clinicians about being explicit or precipitous in disclosing prognostic information. Suggestions included developing an understanding of the factors and context that should affect clinician \"honesty\" or \"directness\" about prognosis. Some participants described a need for a focus on \"human compassion along with the truth.\" They also described possible strategies to use when providing prognosis such as: the physician verbalizing a commitment to non-abandonment; identifying and addressing patient fears, such as pain at the end of life; and communicating a clear and comprehensive \"game plan\" regarding the patient's care from that point forward; and addressing prognosis in terms of outcomes for groups of patients rather than the individual.\nParticipants who endorsed diagram A and B often suggested that physicians should discuss prognosis with the family in situations where they cannot discuss prognosis with the patient. A patient said:\nIf they can't communicate with the patient, then maybe they should communicate with the one closest to them in their family.\nA family member underscored the importance of providing family with information about prognosis and also acknowledged the difficulty of the topic: I always start out by saying, I hate to do it, but I have to use the P word {prognosis}.' {The doc-tor} says, 'We've got this treatment and he should respond well and yada, yada.' And then you have to turn right around and feel like you're just cutting {the patient} off at the knees, saying, 'Ok, well then, what are we looking at?' And it's tough and maybe he {the patient} would rather go without knowing that. But I need {this information}.\nThese comments underscore the participants' concern that explicit prognostic disclosure is emotionally complex and that clinicians must be aware of the emotional impact.\nDirect approach (Diagrams C and D): Participants who endorsed diagrams C and D offered specific recommendations that suggested a direct and straightforward approach to prognosis would be most helpful. These participants were able to manage the emotional impact of prognostic information and were less dependent on the clinician to facilitate their emotional adjustment to the news.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our study examined the interaction of support for hope and explicit delivery of prognostic information and found that patients and families differ in their needs and desires for hope and explicit prognostic information. Despite these differences, our participants did not identify methods for clinicians to assess and meet individual needs, and the question \"how much information\" did not provide patients and families with enough of an opportunity to explain their concerns about receiving explicit prognostic information. This finding may have relevance for clinicians since, based on our study, it seems unlikely that simply asking patients or family members how much information they want in clinical practice will provide useful insights into patient and family needs in this regard. We have described a four diagram approach to explore these issues that successfully elicited differing respondent perceptions about communication preferences for receiving, and providing, hope and prognostic information. However, future studies will be needed to identify the prevalence of endorsement for specific approaches among patients with life-limiting illness and their families as well as the usefulness of these approaches in directing and improving clinician communication.\nAlthough this is the first study to specifically explore different typologies modeling the interaction between support for hope and desire for prognostic information, there are prior studies that have explicitly examined the role of clinicians in influencing hope in patients with terminal or life-limiting illnesses. For example, a study of patients with cancer found that family, friends, and clinicians were the most important sources of support for hope and the majority of patients reported that clinicians were more important than family and friends. 1 A study of patients on an oncology unit found that clinicians both positively and negatively influence hope. 38 Some reported that hope increased when information was given in a sensitive way, when statistics were used compassionately, and when their questions were answered. Ways of decreasing hope included disclosing discouraging medical facts, presenting information disrespectfully, and appearing cold. These findings highlight the importance of clinician communication regarding emotional and informational needs on patient and family hope 35 and, combined with our findings, provide some preliminary direction for future interventions to improve clinician communication.\nPrior research provides some specific suggestions that may be useful in the context of our findings to help design future interventions to improve clinician communication about the interaction of hope and prognosis. A study using focus groups and interviews with patients identified some strategies for clinicians to foster hope specifically when discussing prognosis. 39 These strategies include emphasizing proactive plans and substantive activities, such as controlling pain and providing emotional support, exploring realistic goals, and discussing day-to-day living. All patients and families in this study wanted clinicians to be honest, but many also suggested that clinicians should not provide more information than is wanted. Similar to our findings, this study also noted that there was great variability in patients' endorsements of physicians' hopegiving behaviors and suggested that a range of demographic, psychological and disease factors affect preferences for physician style and behavior concerning prognosis. Our proposed four-diagram conceptual model provides an approach to address these issues.\nOur study has important strengths and limitations. A strength is the insights provided by the in-depth responses that participants made to the issue of hope and prognosis and the detailed responses to the conceptual model. However, our qualitative design does not allow us to determine the proportion of patients who would support each of the approaches nor the prevalence of the finding that some patients and family members move through some of the different diagrams over time. We were also not able to determine whether patients and family members differed in the approaches they would have chosen. Our study design also did not allow us to compare our proposed conceptual model to the work of others regarding communication of bad news or hope in the context of suffering. 40,41 Further study will be needed to address these questions. Another limitation is that the purposive sampling design identified physicians across a spectrum of focus on curative or palliative care but it is not possible to determine how randomly selecting physicians and other participants would have affected the results. A final limitation is that this study was con-ducted in one geographic region with predominantly Caucasian participants. Although the demographics of patients and families reflect the demographics in our region, our results may not generalize to other regions.\nIn summary, this study suggests that there is important variability in the way that patients with life-limiting diseases, particularly COPD and cancer, approach the interaction of wanting support for hope and wanting explicit prognostic information from their clinicians. Furthermore, simply asking patients and family members how much information they want seems to be an unrevealing approach to understanding individuals' needs. The four-diagram model we have developed and used in this study may be a useful heuristic to help clinicians understand individual patients' and families' preferences and needs, but further research is needed to assess prevalence and generalizability of our findings and to determine the utility of this model for improving communication with patients and family members.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "Funding was provided by an RO1 from the National Institute of Nursing Research (RO1-NR-008016).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Emotional support for cancer patients: What do patients really want?", "journal": "Br J Cancer", "year": "1996", "authors": "M L Slevin; S E Nichols; S M Downer; P Wilson; T A Lister; S Arnott; J Maher; R L Souhami; J S Tobias; A H Goldstone; M Cody"}, {"title": "On the nature of hope in palliative care", "journal": "J Palliat Care", "year": "1998", "authors": "C L Nekolaichuk; E Bruera"}, {"title": "The role of hope in patients with cancer", "journal": "Oncol Nurs Forum", "year": "2007", "authors": "G C Chi"}, {"title": "Hope-inspiring strategies of the critically ill", "journal": "Appl Nurs Res", "year": "1989", "authors": "J F Miller"}, {"title": "The Biology of Hope and the Healing Power of the Human Spirit", "journal": "", "year": "1989", "authors": "N: Head Cousins;  First"}, {"title": "", "journal": "American Journal of Psychiatry", "year": "1959", "authors": "K Menninger;  Hope"}, {"title": "Patient hope: Exploring the interactions between physicians and HIV seropositive individuals", "journal": "Qual Health Res", "year": "1997", "authors": "G Wong-Wylie; R F Jevne"}, {"title": "Therapeutic value of hope", "journal": "South Med J", "year": "1984", "authors": "J G Bruhn"}, {"title": "What contributes to hope in the cancer patient", "journal": "Am J Nurs", "year": "1975", "authors": "J A Buehler"}, {"title": "Information and participation preferences among cancer patients", "journal": "Ann Intern Med", "year": "1980", "authors": "B R Cassileth; R V Zupkis; K Sutton-Smith; V March"}, {"title": "Predictors of psychosocial adjustment in patients newly diagnosed with gynecological cancer", "journal": "Cancer Nurs", "year": "1984", "authors": "M H Mishel; T Hostetter; B King; V Graham"}, {"title": "The measurement of pessimism: The hopelessness scale", "journal": "J Clin Psychol", "year": "1974", "authors": "A T Beck"}, {"title": "Hopelessness and eventual suicide: A 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation", "journal": "Am J Psychiatry", "year": "1985", "authors": "A T Beck; R A Steer; M Kovacs; B Garrison"}, {"title": "Depression, hopelessness and desire for hastened death in terminally ill patients with cancer", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "2000", "authors": "W Breitbart; B Rosenfel; H Pessin; M Kaim; J Funesti-Esch; M Galietta; C Nelson; R Brescia"}, {"title": "Relationship of separation and depression to disease", "journal": "Psychosom Med", "year": "1958", "authors": "A H Schmale"}, {"title": "Communicating with realism and hope: Incurable cancer patients' views on the disclosure of prognosis", "journal": "J Clin Oncol", "year": "2005", "authors": "R G Hagerty; P N Butow; P M Ellis; E A Lobb; S C Pendlebury; N Leighl; C Macleod; M H Tattersall"}, {"title": "The dynamics of change: Cancer patients' preferences for information, involvement and support", "journal": "Ann Oncol", "year": "1997", "authors": "P N Butow; M Maclean; S M Dunn; Mhn Tattersall; M J Boyer"}, {"title": "Information needs of cancer patients in west Scotland: Cross sectional survey of patients' views", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "1996", "authors": "C Meredith; P Symonds; L Webster; D Lamont; E Pyper; C Gillis; L Fallowfield"}, {"title": "Communicating with dying patients within the spectrum of medical care from terminal diagnosis to death", "journal": "Arch Intern Med", "year": "2001", "authors": "M D Wenrich; J R Curtis; S E Shannon; J D Carline; D M Ambrozy; P G Ramsey"}, {"title": "Curtis JR: Barriers and facilitators to communication about end-of-life care for patients with COPD", "journal": "Chest", "year": "2005", "authors": "M E Knauft; E L Nielsen; R A Engelberg; D L Patrick"}, {"title": "Why don't patients with AIDS and their clinicians talk about end-oflife care?

Despite the growth and acceptance of hospice in endof-life care, it is estimated that of the 2.4 million people who died in the United States in 2000, only 1 of 4 was under hospice care at the time of death. 1 Emphasis on both quality of life and quality of care of individuals who are approaching death is an integral part of health care; yet for many Americans such expectations are not being met. 2 Health care disparities, particularly among racial and ethnic groups, have been well documented in the scientific literature. The Institute of Medicine report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care defines health care disparities as \"racial and ethnic differences in the quality of health care that are not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences, and appropriateness of intervention.\" 3 Clear disparities have been found in certain areas such as pain management, where there are significant gaps in the experiences and treatment of racial and ethnic minority persons. 4 Currently there is only fragmentary knowledge of the demographics of hospice users or the use of hospice services by specific racial and ethnic groups.\nProviding quality, compassionate care for people facing life-limiting illness or injury is a priority for public attention and concern.

A final group of 13 studies, published between 1998 and January 2006, met all the criteria set forth in this systematic review. Twelve studies found differences in the rate of hospice use between minority racial/ethnic groups and non-Hispanic whites. The majority of studies were retrospective cohort studies using administrative data to compare rates of utilization among minority groups and non-Hispanic whites. No randomized controlled studies, meta-analyses, or any formal literature review were found. There was wide variation in terms of data source, patient characteristics, and sample selection in terms of number and the combinations of racial and ethnic groups that had been used for analysis.\nAmong five studies based on SEER-Medicare Data, four reported differences in hospice utilization among racial and ethnic groups. Lackan and colleagues 5 conducted a study to examine hospice utilization as a function of patient characteristics, such as sociodemographic variables, geographic location, type of insurance, and year of death. The sample included 170,136 patients aged 67 and older diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 1991 to 1996 and died between 1991 and 1999. Within each racial and ethnic group, hospice services were used by 31% of non-Hispanic whites, 27.3% of blacks, and 26.7% of other ethnicities (p \u03fd 0.0001). Higher utilization (p \u03fd 0.0001) was higher for non-Hispanic whites, those enrolled in managed care and those who were younger, married, female, living in urban areas, diagnosed with lung or colorectal cancer, and living in areas with higher education and income levels. The study showed that hospice use increased for both blacks and non-Hispanic whites over the study period, COHEN but the higher ratio of use by non-Hispanic whites compared to blacks remained the same. 5 Ngo-Metzger and colleagues 6 compared Asian and white Medicare beneficiaries who died of primary lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, gastric, or liver cancer between 1988 and 1998. The sample consisted of 184,081 patients of which 5% were Asian, of whom 45% were foreign born. Initial unadjusted analyses showed that U.S.-born Asians used hospice services similarly to U.S.-born whites. However, after adjusting for demographic characteristics, managed care insurance, year of diagnosis, tumor stage at diagnosis, and tumor registry, both U.S.-born and foreign-born Asians were less likely to use hospice than whites (Asian American [odds ratio {OR} \u03ed 0.67; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.62-0.73]; foreign-born [OR \u03ed 0.90; 95% CI: 0.86-0.94]). The authors reported that the same results were consistently found across six cancer diagnoses. 6 McCarthy and colleagues 7 performed their study to examine the factors associated with hospice enrollment and length of stay in hospice among patients diagnosed with lung and colorectal cancer between 1973 and 1996 and died between 1988 and 1998. The authors found that blacks with lung cancer (25%) used hospice services slightly less than whites (27% and those of other race/ethnicity (26%). Blacks also had a significantly longer time to hospice enrollment compared to whites. With colorectal cancer, however, blacks were found to use hospice services more than the other two groups (black 23%; white 20%; other 20%) and no significant difference existed between groups in terms of time to enrollment. Interestingly, for both primary cancer sites, patients of non-white, non-black race/ethnicity had significantly longer times to hospice enrollment. The study further indicated white patients had a shorter length of stay in hospices compared to blacks. 7 Using data gathered in a prospective cohort study, Gallo et al. 8 assessed the relationships between home death and a set of demographic, disease-related, and health-resource factors among individuals who died of cancer in Connecticut during 1994. Both bivariate and multivariate results showed that whites were more likely to die at home than non-whites (bivariate relative risk [RR] \u03ed 1.32, CI \u03ed 1.12-1.59; multivariate RR \u03ed 1.25, CI \u03ed 1.01-1.55). The study indicated that individuals residing in areas with more home hospice providers were more likely to die at home than in the hospital or an inpatient hospice (RR \u03ed 1.17, CI \u03ed 1.05-1.30). 8 Of the five studies that used SEER-Medicare data, only one study found no differences in hospice use by ethnicity. Lackan et al. 9 assessed the use of hospice by women dying with breast cancer between 1991 and 1996 as a function of patient characteristics, time period, and geographic area. They found significant differences (p \u03fd 0.001) where patients who were younger, married, urban, with higher education or income, were more likely to use hospice care. However, they reported non significant differences in hospice use by race or ethnicity (p \u03ed 0.406): white (20.7%); black (19.9%); Hispanic (22.5%); Asian (19.4%). Length of hospice stay did not vary by race/ethnicity, but rate of hospice use increased over time at similar rates for all categories of race and ethnicity. 9 All four studies that used data from national surveys found differences in hospice use between racial and ethnic groups compared to whites. Greiner et al. 10 examined racial/ethnic hospice use variations in a national cohort using the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS). This sample of 23,000 individuals over the age of 15 who died of nontraumatic causes used death certificates and interviews with relatives (proxy respondents) to provide information about mortality, social and economic data, and information about health care utilization in the last year of life. Unadjusted bivariate results indicated African Americans were significantly less likely to use hospice than whites (OR 0.59, p \u03fd 0.0001) and that those without a cancer diagnosis (OR \u03ed 0.28, p \u03fd 0.001) and without a living will (OR \u03ed 0.23, p \u03fd 0.001) were likely to use hospice. 10 African Americans remained less likely to use hospice than whites even after controlling for gender, marital status, education, existence of a living will, medical history (stroke, cancer, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), religiosity, income, and access to health care (p \u03fd 0.001). Having a living will did diminish the negative relationship between African Americans and hospice use. A subanalysis of subjects aged 55 and older again showed African American race/ethnicity was negatively associated with hospice use. This study did not find statistically significant differences in the rate of hospice use between Hispanics or \"other\" and whites; the authors attributed this lack of detecting significant effects to the insufficient power of having small numbers of these individuals in the sample. 10 Lorenz and colleagues 11 evaluated patient and agency characteristics associated with receiving unreimbursed hospice care by using discharge data from the 1998 National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS).

Demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, were not found to be associated with the receipt of unreimbursed care among discharged patients greater than 65 years of age. 11 Another study by Lorenz and colleagues 12 that used data from the 1997 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) annual home care and hospice survey, evaluated the relationship of hospice profit status to patient selection and service delivery. A comparison of for-profit hospices and not-for-profit hospice with their respective demographic characteristics showed that there were indeed racial/ethnic differences in utilization of hospice services. Whites made up of 63% of for-profit hospices, compared to 73% of not-for-profit hospices. Nonwhites, however, made up 37% of for-profit and only 27% of not-for-profit hospices (p \u03fd 0.01). Bivariate and multivariate analyses further indicated that forprofit hospices served higher percentages of Medicare (77% versus 74%; p \u03ed 0.012) and Medi-Cal (11% versus 75, p \u03ed 0.33) compared to not-for-profit hospices; they also had more patients discharged prior to death than not-for-profit hospices (21% versus 14%, p \u03fd 0.001). 12 Cox 13 examined hospice care for persons with AIDS (PWA) by using a survey of hospices in the United States and Puerto Rico listed in the National Association of Homecare Hospices Directory. A comparison of patients in the 957 hospices surveyed revealed that PWAs were more likely to be black (p \u03fd 0.0001) or Hispanic (p \u03fd 0.05), younger, male, and covered by Medicaid. A comparison of PWAs in hospice with PWAs in the total U.S. population indicated that minority PWAs were underrepresented in hospice. Blacks make up 31% of all AIDS cases in the country, yet they made up only 24% of PWAs in hospice care; Hispanics made up 17% of all AIDS cases, yet only 10% of hospice PWAs; whites, however, were overrepresented, making up 52% of total national cases, yet consisted of 64% of PWAs in hospice care. 13 Two of the 13 included studies which used Medicare hospice administration (claims) data from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) also found racial and ethnic differences in hospice utilization. Virnig and colleagues 14 showed that across all types of cancers (bladder or kidney, breast, colorectal, esophageal or stomach, lung, pancreas, and prostate), blacks received approximately 82% of the hospice use as non-blacks. The black:non-black ratio for specific cancers are as follows (where a ratio of 1.0 indicates no difference in hospice use: bladder/kidney, 0.83; breast, 0.89; colorectal, 0.83; esophageal/stomach, 0.82; lung, 0.83; pancreas, 0.83; and prostate, 0.75. These finding emphasize that differences in utilization exist regardless of differences in prognosis across cancers. 14 Miller et al. 15 used HCFA claims data and standardized comprehensive assessments to study nursing home residents who enrolled in hospice care from 1992 to 1996 and died before 1998. Their data from five states (New York, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, and South Dakota) revealed that hospice patients were more often white than nonhospice patients. Multivariable analyses for entire hospice and non-hospice cohorts revealed that non-white individuals had a slightly higher probability of hospitalization (OR \u03ed 1.10, CI \u03ed 1.01, 1.19). The study did find that after adjusting for confounders, hospice care is associated with less hospitalization (OR \u03ed 0.43; 95% CI: 0.39-0.46). Compared to residents in facilities with no hospice, hospitalization was less likely for non-hospice residents in facilities with low hospice use (OR \u03ed 0.82; 95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and moderate hospice use (OR \u03ed 0.71; 95% CI: 0.69-0.74). 15 Both studies involving community hospices found racial and ethnic differences in hospice care. A study by Colon and Lyke 16 from one community-based hospice in New Jersey indicated statistically significant differences in rate of hospice use among European American, African American, and Latino hospice patients African American use of hospice was found to decline significantly during this time period between1992 to 1998, while hospice use by European Americans increased. Variables such as marital status, caregiver status, living situation, payment method, and referral source also contributed to differences found among the groups.\nO'Mara and Arenella 17 examined the ethnic and racial makeup of a large metropolitan hospice facility in Arlington, Virginia, and compared its composition to the regional community in 1997. Results showed that Caucasians had the highest overall coverage of deaths by hospice care at 30%, while hospice services were used by only 20% of Asian decedents, 19% of Hispanic decedents, and 18% of African American decedents. Of note, cancer was the leading admitting diagnosis for racial and ethnic groups. The case study found a higher proportion of African Americans and Hispanics with an admitting diagnosis of HIV and AIDS. Caucasians had higher coverage for all causes of death, while coverage for other races was limited to primarily malignant neoplasms. 17 ", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COHEN 766", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Even though efforts have been made to improve end-of-life care on an individual patient level, this systematic review demonstrates that improvements over the past decade are still not reaching certain segments of our population. Since there are no previous systematic reviews in the field of hospice utilization among racial and ethnic groups, the scope of this review is intended to be broad. The studies show statistically significant differences in rates of hospice use among African American patients compared to white patients; but overall were not adequately powered to show significant differences that might exist in Latino or Asian groups compared to whites.\nThere are limitations inherent to such a broad review. All of the included studies relied on administrative databases and may lack detailed clinical information on disease severity, clinical appropriateness of services studied, comorbid illness, functional impairments, and other information that may influence hospice use. The effect of reimbursement and financing factors also differed from study to study. The studies were conducted only on patients who had data regarding race or ethnicity available. Statistical power was inadequate to detect significant differences in some minority populations, such as Native American patients.\nThe majority of studies examined hospice use among older adults with cancer; it is unclear if the findings are generalizable to non-Medicare patients, younger patients, uninsured patients, and those with diagnoses other than cancer. The studies did not provide data on patient preferences, physician attitudes, timing of referrals, and refusal of health care services. Furthermore, the controls used in the studies were not consistent to allow for quantitative comparison; the presence of confounding factors may contribute to the difficulty of delineating the effects of race and ethnicity. Given that hospice usage patterns may change from year to year, the sampling frame in these studies may not allow for good comparisons between studies nor reflect current conditions of utilization.\nDifferences among racial and ethnic groups found here are similar to differences already reported in various types and levels of health care, ranging from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, access to primary care, to organ transplants, to pain management. Even after controlling for specific sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, African American patients and certain other minority groups use services disproportionately less than white patients.

Objective: Since the medical information presented to subjects is frequently complex, we hypothesized that apparent differences in end-of-life preferences and decision making may be due to disparities in health literacy. A video of a patient with advanced dementia may overcome communication barriers associated with low health literacy. Design: Before and after oral survey. Participants: Subjects presenting to their primary care doctors. Methods: Subjects were asked their preferences for end-of-life care after they heard a verbal description of advanced dementia. Subjects then viewed a 2-minute video of a patient with advanced dementia and were asked again about their preferences. For the analysis, preferences were dichotomized into comfort care and aggressive care. Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and subjects were divided into three literacy categories: low (0-45, sixth grade and below), marginal (46-60, seventh to eighth grade) and adequate (61-66, ninth grade and above). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were fit using stepwise algorithms to examine factors related to initial preferences before the video. Results: A total of 80 African Americans and 64 whites completed the interview. In unadjusted analyses, African Americans were more likely than whites to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, odds ratio (OR) 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-10.9). Subjects with low or marginal health literacy were also more likely than subjects with adequate health literacy to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, OR 17.3 (95% CI 6.0-49.9) and OR 11.3 (95% CI 4.2-30.8) respectively.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Speculation about this finding has focused on African Americans' unique cultural and spiritual belief systems, 1,[4][5][6][7]9 and their lack of trust in the health care system perhaps due to historical experiences such as Tuskegee, in which African American men were deprived of treatment for syphilis as an experiment. [1][2][3][4] Although low health literacy is a prevalent barrier to accurate communication and could confound the relationship between race and informed decision-making, no prior studies on end-of-life decision-making have explored the confounding effects of health literacy.\nMore than 90 million adults in the United States have insufficient literacy skills to be independent health care users, 10 and low health literacy is associated with race, age, education, and having chronic illness. 11 Distinguishing the effect of health literacy from race is important in this context. 12 Ethnicity and culture are factors that may shape preferences and should be respected. By contrast, low health literacy is an obstacle to communicating information for informed decision-making that we should strive to surmount so that we can accurately elicit and respect individual values.\nThere are multiple communication techniques that could be used to overcome barriers posed by health literacy. Visual images have been shown to improve communication of information with patients. [13][14][15][16][17] Prior interventions to improve decision-making have included print, audio, video, and Web-based pictorial materials, 15,[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] with mixed results. 26 The medium of video allows patients to envision health states in a manner not easily captured with verbal communication and can both engage people and efficiently communicate information about the experience of illness. 27 We hypothesized that after hearing a verbal description of advanced dementia, subjects' preferences for care at the end of life for themselves would be independently predicted by health literacy and not race.

The study sites consisted of urban and suburban primary care clinics affiliated with two teaching hospitals in the greater Boston area. Subjects were excluded if they had previously had a close relationship with a person with advanced dementia, since they will likely have had first-hand experience and knowledge of the disease. Previous work suggested that subjects who had a close relationship strongly favored comfort care and that a video did not better inform preferences. 27 Subjects were also excluded if, in the judgment of the physician interviewer, they lacked medical decision-making capacity at the time of the interview, or if they did not speak English, the language of our validated tools.

We then outlined three levels of medical treatments and the goals associated with each level. The first level, life-prolonging care, aims to prolong life at any cost. It includes all medically indicated treatments. The second level, limited care, aims to maintain physical functioning. It includes treatments such as hospitalization, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydration, but excludes attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatments in the intensive care unit. The third level, comfort care, aims to maximize comfort and to relieve pain. It includes oxygen and analgesics but excludes intravenous therapies and hospitalization unless necessary to provide comfort. Subjects were asked which level they preferred in the event they developed advanced dementia. Subjects not able to select a level of treatments were documented as \"don't know.\" Each subject next viewed a 2-minute video of a white patient with advanced dementia.

The design, content, and structure of the video intervention were reviewed for accuracy by three geriatricians and five neurologists, all of whom specialize in the care of patients with dementia.

The REALM is a valid test of word pronunciation and has been shown to correlate well with tests that evaluate a range of literacy skills. 31 As others have done, we defined three categories for literacy: low literacy (REALM score of 0-45, sixth grade and below); marginal literacy (REALM score of 45-60, seventh to eighth grade); and adequate literacy (REALM score of 61-66, ninth grade and above). 11,32 Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of subjects who chose comfort care across levels of health literacy.\nUnivariate analyses for subject characteristics (health literacy, age, gender, education, marital status, religion, religious attendance, and health status) with race and preferences for care were conducted utilizing the Fisher's exact test.

This finding was observed in the current study as well; however, adjusted analyses reveal that health literacy mediates the relationship between race and end-of-life preferences for African Americans. The influence of health literacy on end-oflife decision-making reflected a dose-response effect with increasing health literacy leading toward comfort care. This suggests that race should not be the primary focus of research and patient care regarding end-oflife preferences. Rather, health literacy and a heightened commitment to patient education and communication should be the top priority. The importance of patient education and communication is corroborated by the finding in our study that a video intervention designed to compensate for low health literacy skills had a large impact on patient preferences. Indeed, after viewing the video there were no significant differences in end-of-life preferences by race or health literacy status. Carefully crafted video decision aids designed to overcome barriers posed by health literacy may improve decision-making at the end of life for patients with low health literacy. Furthermore, racial disparities in features of clinical medicine that may be heavily dependent on health literacy, such as we found to be the case in this study, can be influenced by interventions like video that target deficits in health literacy. Video offers a unique and widely accessible means of communication that engages patients in a way not achieved with words.\nNone of the studies previously cited regarding African American preferences at the end of life studied health literacy, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] and few asked about education. 2,3,6 Education is closely related to health literacy, but the two variables clearly represent different constructs. Education level represents how far a person progressed in formal education, not how much literacy skill he/she acquired. Various forces such as social promotion can lead to significant variance between education level and observed literacy. In this country, the average adult English reading level is between eighth and ninth grade, 33 and, the quality of educa- tional outcomes varies significantly. 34 Our results show that both education and health literacy were independently associated with end-of-life care preferences. We posit that health literacy will be more closely related to communication barriers than educa-tion because health literacy is a direct measure of a patient's current skills. Future studies exploring in detail the increasingly recognized roles of health literacy and education at the end of life are important. [35][36] Our study has several important limitations. First, the distribution of low or marginal health literacy between African Americans and whites was not parallel. There were only 8 whites with low or marginal health literacy. Future research on the relationship between race, health literacy, and end-of-life preferences could benefit from a more balanced or simply larger analytic sample. This would permit exploration of additional potential confounders, such as socioeconomic status. In addition, our sample was drawn from the metro Boston area.

We studied the use of a single video clip that was designed to portray advanced dementia in order to overcome barriers posed by health literacy. Future studies exploring the designing and filming of videos to overcome literacy barriers would be useful. It would also be interesting to explore the preferences of subjects using other video clips that varied the features of the patient, such as race and gender. It is important to note that special care needs to be taken to develop patient education materials and decision-aids that empower-not manipulate-patients. Our study asked questions about preferences if patients would be in a state of advanced dementia, a common endof-life scenario. Preferences for end-of-life care in other disease states may be different. Other studies using disease states such as a persistent vegetative state, severe stroke, end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) may be fruitful.\nDiscussions regarding treatments at the end of life will increasingly involve a more diverse pool of patients, and consideration of each patient's culture is important. Yet our data show that accepting a patient's preferences based on a verbal conversation about a future disease state may not reflect a patient's fully informed preferences for end-of-life treatments: the diversity of preferences that have often been attributed to racial and cultural differences are a result of differences in health literacy, not race. Video in addition to improved verbal communication may be one means to overcome barriers posed by health literacy.

Participants and methods: A face-to-face survey and in-depth semistructured interview of 18 academic oncologists who were asked to describe the most recent inpatient death on the medical oncology service. Physicians were asked to describe the details of the patient death, their involvement with the care of the patient, the types and sequence of their emotional reactions, and their methods of coping. Grounded theory qualitative methods were utilized in the analysis of the transcripts. Results: Physicians, who viewed their physician role as encompassing both biomedical and psychosocial aspects of care, reported a clear method of communication about end-of-life (EOL) care, and an ability to positively influence patient and family coping with and acceptance of the dying process. These physicians described communication as a process, made recommendations to the patient using an individualized approach, and viewed the provision of effective EOL care as very satisfying. In contrast, participants who described primarily a biomedical role reported a more distant relationship with the patient, a sense of failure at not being able to alter the course of the disease, and an absence of collegial support. In their descriptions of communication encounters with patients and families, these physicians did not seem to feel they could impact patients' coping with and acceptance of death and made few recommendations about EOL treatment options. Conclusion: Physicians' who viewed EOL care as an important role described communicating with dying patients as a process and reported increased job satisfaction.

A 1998 American Society of Clinical Oncology survey of over 6000 oncologists documented shortcomings in EOL care training for oncologists. Fewer than one third of oncologists reported that their formal training was \"very helpful\" in communicating with dying patients or transitioning goals of care, and over half reported using \"trial and error\" as one important source of learning about EOL care. Only 25% reported the care of dying patients to be highly satisfying. 1 Burnout and decreased job satisfaction are prevalent in many cancer clinicians and lack of training in EOL skills has been identified as a major contributor. [2][3][4] Whippen and Canellos 5 studied burnout in oncologists and found that 56% of respondents reported frustration and a sense of personal failure in their work. The authors concluded that coping with the challenges of providing EOL care may be the single most important qualitative factor related to burnout.\nDespite the evidence that oncologists feel unprepared to care for dying patients and that this may contribute to decreased job satisfaction and burnout, little is known about oncologists' perceptions of the care they provide to dying patients and how they experience and cope with these encounters. By examining oncologists' descriptions of their most recent patient death, we sought to answer two specific questions: how do oncologists understand and describe the psychosocial care (e.g., communication, emotional support) they deliver to patients at the EOL and how do oncologists describe their emotional reactions to and personal coping with these encounters? We undertook an exploratory study to assist us in the development of a conceptual model to better understand how oncologists provide care at the EOL and how provision of that care may impact job satisfaction and burnout.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Selection of participants", "text": "Our study of oncologists' descriptions of the most recent patient death was a secondary data analysis from a larger study of physicians' emotional reactions to deaths of their patients.

An eligible patient case was one in which at least two physicians could be identified who had cared for the patient at the time of death. Between June 1999 and September 2001, all 196 interns, residents, fellows, and attending physicians who agreed to participate were scheduled for a 90-minute semistructured in-person interview regarding their experiences caring for the most recent patient death and a past patient death that the participant identified as their most emotionally powerful.

Physicians often experience tremendous discomfort in first attempts to communicate with dying patients. Unlike other skills in medicine in which the old adage \"see one, do one, teach one\" may apply, communication often requires multiple attempts and frequent failures until the skill is honed to the point where it is both effective and compassionate. We hypothesize that this experimentation is made both easier and more fruitful for the physician if supportive colleagues, role models, and times for reflection are available. If attempts at communication continue to be unsuccessful, such failures may lead to increased discomfort and avoidance of explicit communication with patients and families, resulting in decreased investment in the physician-patient relationship, an increased emphasis on the importance of cure, and decreased job satisfaction, possibly leading to burnout. In contrast, achieving success in these challenging communication tasks may allow the physician to begin to view him or herself as a therapeutic agent who has the ability to positively impact the psychosocial care of the patient and family, regardless of the medical outcome. Through effective communication with patients and families, physicians are likely to build closer relationships. Supportive colleagues, viewing oneself as a therapeutic agent, and a closer relationship with patients and families could all contribute to increased job satisfaction and decreased burnout. [10][11][12] Our conceptual model of the development of communication skills and their relationship to job satis-JACKSON ET AL. 900 faction and burnout has features in common with models used by adult learning theorists such as Schon, Meizrow, and others to explain the processes of professional growth and development in adulthood. [13][14][15][16] These theorists suggest that a learner's ability to identify, conceptualize, and describe a complex task like communication allows the learner to experiment in an intentional way that supports continued skill development, resulting in increased satisfaction with work tasks. It is interesting that none of the oncologists in our study described learning communication in any formalized educational venue, despite the availability of useful educational programs and tools. 18,19 Our qualitative results also suggest a potential relationship between an oncologist's methods of communication with dying patients and job satisfaction and burnout. Oncologists with a clear method of communication appeared to be more satisfied with the care they provided to dying patients and less burned out. However, oncologists with an explicit method of communication had been in practice a greater number of years. While it would be inappropriate to generalize from this sample size, we found this clustering of themes intriguing; if confirmed, these observations suggest several interesting hypotheses about factors that could influence a physician's job satisfaction and burnout.\nWe hypothesize that with more experience oncologists may develop more effective methods of communication that contribute to increased satisfaction. It could also be that oncologists who do not develop effective methods of communication either stop communicating, constrict their role only to the biomedical, or leave clinical oncology entirely at an early stage in their careers.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "ONCOLOGISTS' APPROACHES TO END-OF-LIFE CARE 901", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "Our study is limited in several ways.

Fourth, we have no data about patient satisfaction with those physicians who described a clear method of communication. Recent studies of patient preferences about communication in the context of cancer treatment and during the terminal phase of the illness, however, suggest that patients value an approach that is clear and that includes recommendations by the physician. 21,22 Finally, although appropriate for a qualitative study, a sample of 18 participants limits our ability to make statistical comparisons between groups.

If physicians who use a process-oriented approach to communication are found to have decreased burnout and increased job satisfaction and retention, a communication intervention targeting physicians early in their careers may be beneficial. 24,25 It is possible that providing communication training to physicians early in training (e.g., oncology fellows) may not only improve patient care, but also may improve job satisfaction and job retention among oncology junior faculty.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A Survey Instrument for Most Recent Patient Death Read to Respondent:", "text": "This study is an effort to learn about physicians' emotional reactions to patients' deaths.

Few physicians, including specialists, receive formal training during residency about communication, and even doctors who routinely deliver difficult news admit that they are unsure of their ability to properly perform this task. [1][2][3] Cultural and ethnic differences further complicate matters, and astute clinicians recognize that communication with each patient and family is a unique experience.\nIn this paper, we present a narrative review of the evidence for general communication strategies as well as specific communication techniques to be used during the delivery of bad news and discussions of endof-life treatment decisions. In addition, we also explore the role of culture and ethnicity in end-of-life communication. The primary sources for communication strategies for delivery of bad news came from prognostic discussions in oncology and the intensive care unit (ICU). The literature base is currently developing, and the quality of evidence overall remains moderate to poor. While there is a developing literature showing the benefits of specific communication interventions, much of the information about general communication strategies, communication of bad news, and cultural preferences for care comes from focus group studies, patient surveys, and expert opinion.\nTo clarify the level of evidence, we have used the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) 4 to grade the level of evidence of specific communication recommendations summarized in Tables 1-3. SORT is a measure of the quality of patient outcome oriented evidence. \"A\" level grading represents consistent evidence from two or more high quality studies, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews. \"B\" level evidence represents inconsistent or lesser quality studies, including cohort studies and case series. \"C\" is evidence based on expert opinion or general practice.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PRINCIPLES OF GOOD COMMUNICATION", "text": "Several general skills improve communication between patients and clinicians in all settings. These include preparing oneself for the encounter, creating a supportive environment, using appropriate nonverbal behaviors, and expressing empathy.

When possible, the physical setting for patient encounters ought to be private, quiet and comfortable.\nDespite the hectic nature of one's schedule, patients do not want to feel rushed and nonverbal techniques such as sitting down, making eye contact, intently focusing on the patient or family and not looking at one's watch can help create the perception of ample time and convey empathy. 8,9 While many physicians experience empathy with patients, it is crucial that it is openly communicated to the patient, as even short demonstrations can decrease patient anxiety. 10 Patient concerns should be elicited through the use of open-ended questions, focusing on psychological aspects of the illness, summarizing, and clarifying areas of poor understanding. Using closed-ended or leading questions, premature advice, and focusing on physical aspects of disease tends to inhibit disclosure, and these should be avoided. 9 With good communication, patients report better outcomes, greater satisfaction, improved understanding, enhanced adherence to treatment and decreased litigation.

In one study, lung cancer nurse specialists met separately with patients following bad news discussions, and wrote physicians notes summarizing these encounters. Nearly all of these physicians found the notes provided useful new information. 28 Social workers also facilitate such communication.

Consistently across many studies, when asked about their wish to hear information about diagnosis, symp-toms, treatments, side effects, and prognosis, the majority of patients indicate they want as much information as possible. [40][41][42][43][44] Despite this preference, patients often do not express to clinicians their full desire for information. In one study of patients with advanced cancer, the use of open-ended questions during the interview revealed concerns about disease progression, symptoms, and the dying process that patients had previously felt were not answerable. 45 One of the areas that patients are least likely to ask about is prognosis. 46 Patients and caregivers wish to hear a realistic assessment of their prognosis, 47 but may want this information presented in a positive manner. 42,48 For example, in women with recent diagnoses of breast cancer, information about the chance of cure was identified by more than 90% of women as very important, whereas information about the shortest time someone with cancer might live was very important to only 30% of patients. 49 In addition, qualitative estimates of prognosis are often perceived as more desirable than quantitative estimates. 42,46 Despite the desire of most patients for prognostic information, some patients do not want full disclosure. Furthermore, patients often vary in their desire for prognostic disclosure over the course of illness, with many focusing on information about disease and treatment when first diagnosed, and prognostic information at later visits. 40,42,50 That said, as their disease progresses even further, fewer patients want to have explicit discussions about their prognosis. Therefore, at each point in time, clinicians should maintain a patient centered focus and clarify with patients how much information they want to know before discussing prognostic information. 46,51 Family members often want to be involved in discussions of prognosis and bad news, yet the literature shows some patients want family present whereas others do not. [52][53][54][55][56][57] Alternatively, some patients may want bad news delivered to their family, trusting that their family will disclose to them what they feel is appropriate. It is important to respect patients' preferences, including who should be present and who should not, and to identify family dynamics regarding who will be involved in discussions, who will make decisions, and how consensus will be achieved. 52,53 Furthermore, patients and family members often have differing needs for information during bad news discussions. For example, in a study of terminally ill patients with cancer, family members were often interested in hearing about prognosis and what to expect as the disease progressed, whereas patients wanted information about daily living and symptom control. 58 Further- ", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES AND CULTURAL ISSUES 961", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Recommendation Grade", "text": "Only professional medical interpreters should be A used, unless it is absolutely unavoidable.

[73][74][75] Patients who inappropriately believe in the curability of their cancer are more likely to choose alternative and aggressive treatments. 67,68,76 Of note, in such patients with advanced disease, there does not appear to be a survival difference in those who choose treatment directed toward cure compared with those that choose palliation only. 68 The role of hope Many providers worry that being truthful about prognosis may contribute to a loss of hope. 77,78 While not supported by consistent evidence, 79 patients often feel that a loss of hope contributes to poor outcomes. 80 Indeed, healthcare providers, families, and patients rate the provision of hope as very important, even in situations involving a terminal prognosis, 32,43,56,60,[81][82][83][84] and report increased stress when told that \"nothing more can be done.\" 85 That said, providing hope does not mean that clinicians must do whatever is necessary to preserve the idea of treatment effect or cure. 47 At all stages of illness, clinicians can provide hope and a positive outlook even in the face of a poor prognosis. Such hope should be realistic, and focus on topics such as goals of care, symptom control, and supportive resources, rather than unrealistic expectations. 32,63,86 For example, terminally ill patients want reassurances that doctors will take care of them, not abandon them, and that they will not suffer. 60,87 Such practices are consistent with psychological hope theory, in which hope is defined in terms of selection of goals, identification of pathways, and motivation to attain goals. Patients with high hope are able to identify attainable goals, find alternative pathways, and summon the motivation and energy to achieve their goals. However, in situations in which the desired goals are unattainable, as in dying patients, it is beneficial to focus on alternative, attainable goals. 88 Providers can help patients realize these new goals and maintain hope by providing clear information, controlling symptoms, and maintaining functionality. 89 ", "n_publication_ref": 47, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Culture and disclosure of bad news", "text": "Maintaining hope even in the face of a poor prognosis is often culturally determined. Most white and African American patients expect to be fully informed of their condition and to use that information to make decisions about all aspects of their care. 90 On the other hand, if the patient belongs to a culture where the risks of truth-telling are generally seen to outweigh the benefits, then the emphasis may be on protecting the patient from full knowledge in order to maintain hope. [91][92][93][94][95][96][97] For example, for Bosnian immigrants, nondisclosure is seen as benevolent and protective 98 and traditional Navajo believe disclosure of truth causes bad outcomes. 99 While the ethical issues surrounding communication of sensitive and difficult information are usually framed in terms of \"telling\" or \"not telling\" the truth, things are rarely so clear-cut.

Learning the truth in a more indirect way may be seen as preferable because the ambiguity allows the patient the possibility of hope. 97,102 Differences in patients can become complex, with variations within groups and immigrants who take on characteristics of their new country. 100,103 In Japanese immigrants to the United States, acculturation has increased their desire for truthful disclosure and decreased their desire for nonverbal communication of a poor prognosis. 100 In general, patients with less education, older age, and more advanced illness are less in favor of truthful disclosure. 104,105 While patients from many ethnic groups, such as Asian, Navajo, African, Central and South American, and Eastern European, may not desire full disclosure of prognosis, 90,99,[106][107][108][109][110] treating patients as rigid members of cultural groups, with specified characteristics, is not a practical approach. 111,112 A potential method that was well received in one study, was the use of advance discussions while patients were healthy to determine the degree of truth telling they desired. 105 This allowed doctors to conform to patients' desires in a low-stress setting.\nGiven the complexities of discussing prognosis, no \"one size fits all\" approach can be expected to be successful in all patients. Rather, recognizing a physician's cultural bias, listening to patients and family, and engaging them in a dialogue and negotiation about preferences for truth disclosure, decision making, and family involvement offers respect for each patient's individuality and autonomy. 112,113 Physicians must respect the desires of the patients for the type of information they seek, their desires to maintain hope, and the cultural norms each patient brings to the clinical encounter.

For example, patients with cancer prefer to have a knowledgeable specialist provide them with the most up-to-date treatments and information. 32,56,57,60,85,127 In contrast, families of trauma patients value most the ability to answer questions, rather than seniority of the person giving the news. 128 Usually, the person most involved in the patient's care or with the most established, trusting relationship is best situated to deliver bad news. 53,60 Most patients prefer that discussions occur in a private location, free from distractions, and with a clinician who has the appropriate amount of time available. 56,57,85,114,128,129 When families sense that a conversation is rushed, they report decreased satisfac-", "n_publication_ref": 21, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES AND CULTURAL ISSUES 963", "text": "tion, 82,[127][128][129][130] whereas increased frequency of meetings and proportion of family speech during meetings with providers increases satisfaction. 131,132 Conversations should occur in person, but the relative importance of physician positioning, layout of the room, and physical contact varies across studies. In all cases, body language, such as being seated and establishing eye contact, should be used to convey empathy and establish trust. 56,82,114 Yet, the optimal amount of physical closeness is controversial. Sitting next to the patient appears to be unnecessary. 47,56,133 Physician touch has the potential to convey hope and express caring, yet not all patients are receptive. 47,84,114,134 In one survey, women desired physical contact more than men, 128 whereas in another, patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) noted the benefit of touch more often than other groups. 84 Ultimately, one must gauge each patient individually, be aware that some patients may not welcome consolation by touching, and recognize that forced gestures are not desired. 47,55,56,84,128,133,134 Clinicians should begin the bad news discussion by assessing the patient and family's understanding of the medical situation. 135 This ensures a shared understanding between the two parties, and provides the opportunity for correction of misconceptions.\nEven though patients and families are generally interested in obtaining as much information as possible, the variability of preferences suggests that clinicians should ask patients and families how much they want to know before delivering bad news. If possible, this step is best completed at an earlier time, prior to the actual delivery of news. 136 Families report that bad news information should be conveyed in an honest, straightforward, and caring manner that is not too blunt. 47,56,57,60,82,114,[127][128][129][130]137,138 For example, in interviews about prognostic disclosure, patients often wanted information presented sensitively, making sure they were prepared, and delivered in a way that maintained hope. 82 In addition, patient satisfaction is higher when information is given at the patient's pace and at the level of detail they desire. 56,60 A good rule of thumb is to give only three facts at a time before pausing for a break and specifically checking for understanding. Patients and families place value on checking for comprehension, 32,43,53,114 and emphasize that there should be time throughout the discussion to ask questions and have an appropriate discussion of topics that are not clear. 47,56,57,128,133 Supplementary information, including written material, may help decrease anxiety, improve patients' knowledge and retention of information, and satisfaction with encounters. [55][56][57]139,140 Yet, within written materials, some patients have reported that graphic displays enhance the negative aspects of bad news. 42,48 Providing audio recordings of clinical visits has improved patient satisfaction in some studies, but may be detrimental for people with very poor prognoses, as listening to the recording painfully relives the experience of hearing the bad information. 47,[55][56][57][141][142][143][144] In one randomized trial, patients with poor prognoses who had been given audiotapes of the bad news clinic visit showed greater distress at 6 months than patients who had not received an audiotape. 141 At the end of the discussion, physicians should summarize the information and make a plan for future care. While family meetings to discuss bad news often do not provide a definite clinical direction, at the conclusion of the discussion, a plan for interim care and further meetings should be established.", "n_publication_ref": 68, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "ADVANCE CARE PLANNING", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Advance directives", "text": "Doctors and families must often determine what interventions and treatments an incapacitated patient would prefer. In one study, less than 5% of ICU patients were able to communicate with doctors at the end of life. 145 Advance directives, created to assist in these scenarios, have demonstrated limited effectiveness.\nOne problem with advance directives has been their low prevalence; it has been estimated that less than 25% of the general population has executed such documents. 146,147 Even in at-risk populations, such as endstage renal disease or geriatric patients, the penetration remains low. 146,[148][149][150][151] Doctors are frequently unaware of advance directives that may exist, or do not have them available when needed. 152 When advance directives are present, they often are not detailed enough to affect medical decision making. 153,154 Despite their promise, advance directives have been shown to not have an impact on the cost of medical care, 155 or the frequency of life support interventions. 156 They are rarely associated with discussions between patients and physicians, 157 and do not increase levels of discussion between doctors and patients. 158 Another concern is that decisions based on advance directives by surrogate decision makers often do not correspond to the decisions or values of the patients themselves. 159,160 In a meta-analysis on this topic, surrogates were accurate in only 68% of cases. 161 Information about accuracy is difficult to interpret, as both BARCLAY ET AL. 964 physicians and surrogate decision-makers tend to be accurate in extreme cases, such as those involving very promising or very dire prognoses, but are frequently wrong in more complex cases, such as those involving dementia, or those with a small, but definable chance of recovery. 162 Surrogate decision-makers are often no more accurate in predicting desires of patients than models using actuarial data. 163 Furthermore, in a study of hypothetical clinical scenarios in which physician decisions might conflict with patient preferences for treatment, physicians made decisions in conflict with the advance directive in 65% of cases, highlighting the difficulty of making decisions strictly based on these documents. 164 To increase the accuracy of advance directives, many experts encourage doctors and family members to discuss patients' preferences at the time an advance directive is created. While some studies have shown a benefit in having such discussions, 159,162 they have generally not been shown to be effective. 165,166 In one trial, patients and surrogates were randomized to one of five conditions (no advance directive, or scenario or value-based advance directive with and without discussions with their surrogate). Surrogate predictions of treatments in nine hypothetical scenarios were not improved either with the use of an advance directive or discussions of treatment. 166 Many patients have expressed the desire for their family members to make medical decisions based on their own beliefs and needs at the time, rather than adhering strictly to the patient's advance directive. In a study of a subset of patients from the SUPPORT and HELP cohorts, greater than 70% in each subset indicated a preference for their surrogate and doctor to make decisions about resuscitation, rather than strictly following their advance directive. 167 In addition, in a study of 150 dialysis patients, only 39% of patients wanted strict adherence to their advance directive, while 61% wanted their family to have some choice in making decisions against their advance directive (19% \"a little,\" 11% \"a lot,\" and 31% \"complete\"). 168 Another difficulty with advance directives is the question of stability over time. Although patients' preferences are usually stable, some data suggest that they may change over time, including periods as short as 1-2 years. [169][170][171][172] In general, decisions regarding more severe conditions or prognoses (such as a coma with no chance of recovery), and those involving only minor debility tend to be more stable; while more moderate conditions (such as a stroke with a small chance of recovery) are more variable. 170,173 Further variability exists in regards to refusal versus acceptance of treatment. In a longitudinal cohort study of 2536 pa-tients older than 65, treatment choices were followed for 2 years. 172 There was wide variability, but refusal of treatment was more stable than agreeing to treatment, with 66%-75% of treatment refusals showing stability while only 18%-43% of treatment requests remained the same. In multivariate analysis, hospitalization, increased depression, and loss of social support were associated with the desire for more treatment.\nDespite the problems with advance directives and the difficulty with their use in patient care, physicians should not abandon them altogether. Rather, advance directives represent a useful tool for beginning advance care discussions regarding future care. In such advance care discussions, patients, family, and physicians should discuss a patient's values and goals of care, identify a surrogate decision-maker, and encourage regular communication regarding patient desires for care. Specific scenarios which are likely to occur can be discussed, but the overall discussion should focus on communicating information and sharing patient goals and values.

In practice, however, families are usually involved in all aspects of decision making no matter what the cultural background, and the difference between a family-centered and patient-centered style is a matter of emphasis. Even in North America, where patient autonomy is paramount, surveys show that patients want to talk with their families about their desires, and have them involved in decisions at the end of life. 167,[207][208][209] One can frame the difference between these two styles of decision making in this way: are choices about medical care mainly the province of the patient, with the family responsible for supporting, persuading, and helping them decide according to what is best for the patient (patient-centered style); or are the medical choices a matter which is mainly the province of the family who are responsible for making choices which serve the good of the whole family, which includes but is not limited to the patient (family-centered style)? For Western patients, this often means that the patient is responsible for making medical decisions and autonomy is stressed, while for many Asian and Eastern European patients, the family is the preferred decision maker. 90,98,105,206 However, the situation is rarely clear-cut, with many Japanese families who have migrated to the United States preferring that family members make decisions regarding health care, while many Taiwanese patients with cancer state a preference to be informed of cancer diagnoses before their family members. 100,111 In addition, many African Americans prefer that family be involved in care at the end of life. 204 Often, education and experience with an illness or health care influences patients to favor autonomy. 90,99 Despite these differences, it is important to note that family often plays a close role, and even in those studies where patients stress autonomy, involvement of family is still important. 103,111 Cultural obligations to family members, including the duty of children to care for, honor, and respect their parents, or \"filial piety,\" may add even more complexity. Such obligations may be interpreted to mean doing everything possible to keep an elderly parent alive \"even one more day.\" 205 Allowing the parent to die by removal of life support might be seen as indicating a lack of filial piety and bring disgrace on the family. 103 Conflicts occur when family insists that patients not be informed and not participate, or when family insists on treatments that the patient does not want. An elderly Korean woman may tell the nurse she is tired of getting chemotherapy and wishes she could go home and stop treatment. The next day her son insists on every possible treatment and the patient agrees. In this situation, health care providers may feel that the patient is being ignored and pressured unduly by her family, however, this may be a misunderstanding of the situation. The patient may expect or even want her family to make decisions, and feel that her own wishes about end-of-life care are less relevant than the good of the family as a whole. 205 Family desires and culture may complicate completing documents such as advance directives and DNR orders. Caucasian patients, whose emphasis is on autonomy, are more likely to know about and have completed advance directives and DNR orders than African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. [210][211][212] Factors predicting acceptance of advance directives include education level, prior experience with ventilators, availability of family, severity of illness, and age. 213 Hispanic and African American patients note that there is less need for an advance directive due to expected family roles in medical decision-making. 214,215 Furthermore, in some faith communities, including white, African American, and Hispanic congregations, fear of being denied care is cited as a reason for not accepting advance directives. 216 Distrust of the medical system, as well as a strong faith in God are barriers to advance directives and DNR orders by African American patients. 215 Because of the belief in miracles and the conviction that only God can determine when a patient dies, African American patients are often reluctant to limit their medical treatment. 217 Unfortunately, even with a faith-based initiative to increase the use of advance directives, their use remains low. 215 However, despite the low use of advance directives in these communities, physicians should still discuss end-of-life care with their patients, keeping in mind that many patients may not want formal documentation of their preferences.", "n_publication_ref": 33, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Expectations regarding the doctor-patient relationship", "text": "A shared decision-making model, in which patients are expected to participate in decisions about their care, is not the norm in all cultures. 106,218 In many countries, patients may expect physicians to assume a directive role, making decisions on disclosure of information and treatment. 98,219,220 Even in Western countries, where autonomy is stressed, many patients want the physician to decide on treatment course. Therefore, physicians should assess how much of a role patients desire in their care. 135,[221][222][223][224] Furthermore, patients from cultures with a more paternalistic medical style may misunderstand the intentions of physicians who are attempting to include them in decision making. For example, it is common in this country for oncologists to discuss the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with their patients in order to determine if it is appropriate to continue treatment. Patients unaccustomed to being included in this type of decision may interpret this as the oncologist telling them they must have chemotherapy. In situations like these, physicians may need to be more explicit about the fact that they are asking for input from the patient, and be willing to offer their opinion about the best course of action.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES AND CULTURAL ISSUES", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Interpreters", "text": "One important need of all medical centers is adequate language interpretation. The use of family interpreters, although widespread (up to one third of clinical encounters) and perhaps inevitable, has been discouraged. [225][226][227][228] In studies of the use of family interpreters, family members frequently misinterpreted words and children interpreters frequently avoided topics dealing with bodily functions. 229 Furthermore, when ad hoc interpreters or family members do make mistakes, they are more likely to be clinically significant. 230 The answer is not as simple as avoiding family interpreters and inserting licensed medical interpreters or \"language lines.\" 231 If family members are expected to act as filters for all medical information, to ban them from this role without further discussion may lead to conflict. Furthermore, licensed interpreters are often trained to act as \"voice boxes\"; literally interpreting what is being said. They may or may not be prepared to, or empowered to, offer information about the cultural issues that may be involved in the discussion. 231 Cultural interpretation, as compared to literal interpretation, would include telling the health care providers which topics are taboo to discuss. 231 For example, if a test comes back indicating a non-English-speaking patient has cervical cancer, the English-speaking-only physician will need an interpreter to help convey this information. Prior to discussing this with the patient, it would also be helpful to know whether the patient is expecting to be told this sort of news directly, or whether it is acceptable in this culture to discuss the patient's reproductive organs in front of male relatives. Interpretation does not take the place of education about cultural issues-it is necessary but not sufficient. Whether a strict interpretation or cultural interpretation is used, communicating with a language discordant patient can be challenging, and general guidelines can facilitate this discussion (Table 3).", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Improvements in cultural care", "text": "Interventions to improve cultural awareness and provide culturally competent care include provider education, focus groups with patients, and programs to improve adherence to recommendations and health outcomes for specific cultural groups. [232][233][234][235] Empirical data on these interventions shows improvement in knowledge, 236,237 attitudes of providers, 236 patient satisfaction, 238,239 and improved patient outcomes. [233][234][235]240,241 The key to prevention of misunderstanding is education. Health care institutions need to be aware of the demographics of patients in their area, and provide community involvement in education of cultural aspects and desires for care of each of these groups. Focus groups with patients 242,243 and providers 244 can identify areas of concern, but providers must also recognize that patients may have beliefs that vary considerably from their cultural heritage. Physicians must also recognize their own beliefs and biases. 113 Conflict at the end of life Conflict occurs during decisions to limit or withdraw care at the end of life. Data regarding the incidence of conflict between family and physicians is variable, with estimates ranging from 16% to 48% of cases involving end of life care. 245,246 For example, in an academic medical center study, conflict between staff and family was noted in 48% of cases and conflict between family members was noted in 24% of cases. 247 Often, the source of conflict results from breakdowns in communication between physicians and family. In multiple studies of interviews with family members reporting conflict, lack of information is cited as a major factor in disagreements with clinical staff. 245,246,248 Family members desire more information and in one study of conflict no participants reported receiving too much information. 245 Families cite doctors' lack of acknowledgement of all family members, lack of privacy for family meetings, the need for information without medical jargon, lack of consistency of information across providers, and the need to feel listened to as key problems in communication. 245,248 Health care providers also cite difficulty in dealing with families, emotional issues, cultural differences, and prognostic uncertainty as barriers to effective communication at the end of life. 64,249 The need for and benefits of improved communication are highlighted in recent work in ICU family meetings. Several studies have implemented communication interventions, including proactive case finding, ethics consultations, social worker support, and provision of information. [250][251][252][253][254] Such studies have shown several benefits to proactive communication, including increased proportion of DNR and comfortonly measures for high-risk patients, improved comprehension of treatments, and decreased length of both hospital and ICU stay. For example, an intervention consisting of a communications team for patients in the ICU felt to be at high risk for dying reduced ICU length of stay and costs of ICU care. 255 These interventions demonstrate that good communication facilitates negotiations surrounding goals of BARCLAY ET AL. 968 care and emotionally difficult decisions. Improvement in communication, including discussions between providers, is vital for resolution of conflict at the end of life. 64,248 Providing a dialogue in which the concerns and decision-making styles of all parties are openly discussed, helps to increase discussion, resolve differences and establish trust. 103,231,256 ", "n_publication_ref": 40, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Good communication, always challenging in health care, is especially difficult at the end of life.

Design: Retrospective exploratory study. Setting: Seven Italian long-term care institutions with more than 200 beds. Participants: One hundred forty-one patients with advanced (FAST stage \u03ed 7c) dementia (Alzheimer disease, vascular, other kinds of dementia, severe cognitive impairment). Measurement: Diagnosis, Mini-Mental State Examination, cause of death. Data were collected from clinical and nursing records referring to the last 30 days of life: symptoms and signs, intensity and incidence, treatments (antibiotics, analgesics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, artificial nutrition/hydration, and use of restraints); the last 48 hours: cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts and life-sustaining drugs. Results: Patients were given antibiotics (71.6%), anxiolytics (37.1%), and antidepressants (7.8%). Twenty-nine patients (20.5%) were tube-or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)-fed. Most patients (66.6%) were also parenterally hydrated (72 intravenously, 15 by hypodermoclysis). Some form of physical restraint was used for 58.2% (bed-rails and other immobilizers). Almost half of the patients had pressure sores. In general, attention to physical suffering was fairly good, but during the last 48 hours a number of interventions could be considered inappropriate for these patients: tube feeding (20.5%), intravenous hydration (66.6%), antibiotics (71.6%), and life-sustaining drugs (34.0%). Conclusions: Some indicators imply a less than optimal quality of care (restraints, pressure sores, psychoactive drugs, and the lack of documentation of shared decision-making) and suggest that far advanced demented patients are not fully perceived as \"terminal.\"", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "D EMENTIA is a long and highly debilitating illness. Its duration cannot be estimated and is still much debated, with reports of average survival ranging from 3 to 16 years. 1 During the illness, the patient experiences a progressive loss of autonomy and capacity, up to complete dependence and cognitive impairment. This process is gradual and its progression depends on the type of dementia, age, comorbidity, treatments, quality of care, and social networks. 2 In advanced stages patients frequently have to be admitted to long-term care geriatric institutions and nursing homes, where they spend the last part of their lives 3 and where they are expected to receive palliative and end-of-life care. Their average age is generally more than 80 years. The prevalence of severe dementia in nursing homes may be as high as 80%. 3,4 Advanced dementia is unquestionably a terminal disease, but in nursing homes and long-term care institutions this is seldom acknowledged by doctors and health professionals. 4,5 Patients are rarely referred to palliative care services and hospices, and are often exposed to aggressive treatments. 6 The literature highlights important differences not only between countries, but even between institutions and settings in the same country, 4,[7][8][9] and suggests that major educational interventions are needed for the professionals involved in the care of patients with advanced dementia. 5,10,11 In Italy the epidemiology of dementia is similar to other developed countries. 12 Its incidence is rising: after 2020, 213,000 new cases per year are predicted, more than 40% more than in 2000. 13 Although no information is available on the usual place of care and death, it is likely that given the scarcity of comprehensive home care services in Italy, the majority of demented elderly are admitted to long-care institutions, known as Residenza Sanitaria Assistenziale (RSA) or Health and Welfare Dwellings, set up by the Italian Ministry of Health in 1989 for people with physical, mental, and sensory disabilities, and aged persons who are not self-sufficient and/or have no family support but have no acute illness that requires hospital treatment.\nRSAs are a mix of nursing home and geriatric hospital with their own staff of physicians, mostly geriatricians. These residential establishments differ widely in their numbers of inpatients, the services offered (i.e., occupational therapy, special units for patients with Alzheimer disease, day care admission), and quality of care, but very few provide palliative care consultation. Information on RSAs is scarce and mostly anecdotal, and virtually nothing is known about what treatments are provided for severely demented patients near death.\nThis retrospective study was therefore conducted in seven large RSAs in northern Italy, with the following aims:\n1. To describe the last month of life of severely demented people (\u0546 Fast 7c) according to the clinical and nursing records and, in particular, the use of artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH); and 2. To describe the management of their end-of-life events.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "We conducted a retrospective exploratory study on patients who had died in the previous 12 months in seven large RSAs with more than 200 beds in the province of Cremona (Regione Lombardia, northern Italy). Four specially trained nurses not employed by the RSAs in the survey screened all the clinical and nursing records and identified eligible patients. At least two nurses concurrently analyzed all the records: problems and discrepancies were discussed on site, interviewing the doctors and nurses who had cared for the patient. All patients with a documented diagnosis of severe cognitive impairment (Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and other kinds of dementia), admitted more than 1 month before death and who died between March 1, 2004 and February 28, 2005 were selected. A FAST stage \u0546 7c was considered \"severe.\" 14 The FAST scale, a test of functioning tailored for Alzheimer disease, consists of 7 major stages with a total of 16 progressive substages from 1 to 7f. Stage 7 indicates the most advanced dementia and is divided as follows: 7a, speech limited to 1-5 words; 7b, loss of all intelligible vocabulary; 7c, no walking; 7d, unable to sit independently; 7e, unable to smile; 7f, unable to hold head up. Patients not already classified with the FAST scale were assigned the appropriate FAST stage by the investigators, on the basis of the information on clinical records.\nThe following data were collected from clinical records, referring to:\n1. The last 30 days of life: concomitant diseases, symptoms and signs and their intensity (severe or not severe, according to information reported on clinical records) and incidence (present only one week or more), pressure ulcer, treatments (antibiotics; analgesics-WHO pain ladder, 15 anxiolytics, antidepressants, artificial nutrition and hydration, surgical procedures, use of restraints, and transfer to acute care. 2. The last 48 hours: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts (tracheal intubation, tube/mask artificial ventilation, cardiac massage, electric cardioversion) and life-sustaining intravenous drugs (cardiokinetics, sympathomimetics, antiarrhythmics, high-dose intravenous steroids).\nThe existence of living wills and the documented involvement of the family in end-of-life decisions was recorded. Confidentiality was guaranteed by providing to the researcher only coded information. All the necessary authorizations were obtained and the protocol was presented and discussed before the study with the persons responsible in the RSAs. The data collection form was pilot-tested on five cases.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "The clinical records were clear and fairly informative, although the cause of death was not recorded for 27 patients (19.1%).\nThe seven RSAs had a total of 1958 occupied beds (median, 280; range, 200-325), and five had special care units for patients with Alzheimer disease. The number of patients admitted in the year ranged from 33 to 156 (median, 98). The ratio of full-time equivalents per bed ranged from 0.41 to 0.60 for nurses' aids, and from 0.1 to 0.24 for doctors and nurses. The regional standard sets a minimum of 901 minutes of care per bed per week (including physicians, health professionals, and other personnel).\nOf 476 deaths, 141 (29.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.5%-33.9%) were eligible for the survey (diagnosis of dementia and stage FAST 7c). The number in each RSA ranged from 4.6% to 8.8% (median, 7.3%). The patients' main characteristics and concomitant illnesses are presented in Table 1. As expected, the mean age is high and females outnumber men. All patients were cared for in the RSA until death.\nDuring the month before death, 124 patients (88%) experienced severe symptoms (Table 2). Due to the problems that can arise in the advanced stages of dementia (inhalation of food, bed rest, incontinence with catheterization, and lung and urinary tract infections) fever is an expected, widespread event. Nearly half the patients suffered dyspnea, but only 26% for more than 1 week (data not shown).\nThe most frequently reported symptom in clinical records was drowsiness (27 patients). Drowsiness, rattles, hypotension, and dyspnea were often recorded together during the last days of life and are to be interpreted as premortem signs. The number of patients with seizures was unexpectedly low.\nPain was never measured with a specific scale. When present, it was only recorded, mostly by the nurses, in clinical DI GIULIO ET AL. 1024 records, and was usually described as mild or severe. Pain was recorded in 1 of 4 patients, and in 23 cases it was described as severe, and occurring more than once per week. The majority of patients with pain were prescribed analgesics (28/37; 75.6%; analgesics were administered to 8 patients for whom pain was not reported). Overall, 19 were treated with strong opioids: 11 regularly (step 3 of the WHO pain ladder); 7 as needed; and 1 not known. One patient was treated with weak opioids regularly (step 2 of the WHO pain ladder); the others received as-needed analgesics (nonopioids DYING WITH ADVANCED DEMENTIA: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY 1025  and/or weak opioids). The use of strong opioids varied greatly among the RSAs: from 0% to 37% of the patients who received analgesics.\nIn the last 30 days of life 101 patients (71.6%) were given antibiotics (85% had fever or urinary tract infection); 53 (37.1%) were prescribed anxiolytics (27 on a regular basis, the others on an as-needed basis), and 11 antidepressants (7.8%); 20 (37.7%) patients who were administered anxiolytics suffered restlessness.\nOverall, 29 patients (21%) were artificially fed: 25 through a nasogastric tube and 4 from a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), often associated with parenteral hydration. Artificial nutrition varied within RSAs from no patient to 8 artificially fed. Most patients (94/141; 66.6%) were also hydrated (72 intravenously, 15 by hypodermoclysis; 7 not known).\nAdmissions to hospital were rare (only 2 patients, for surgical problems). Some form of physical restraint was used for most patients (82, 58.2%): 73 had bed-rails (65 on a permanent basis,) and 26 had other immobilizers (ankle/wrist immobilizers, immobilizer belt, safety vest, immobilizer belt with braces, etc.; Table 3). Of the 82 restrained patients, 38 (46%) were also sedated.\nShortly before death, some form of emergency intervention and/or diagnostics were implemented in 60 cases (42.5%; Table 4), including four CPRs.\nThe degree of medical \"interventionism\" varied among RSAs: except for oxygen therapy, some emergency intervention was attempted for 0%-53.9% of patients who ultimately died.\nThe involvement of the family in decisions related to patients' care was only rarely noted in the clinical record (16, 11.3%); this might include discussion about admission to the hospital or the decision to reinsert a nasogastric tube. No advanced directives were recorded because living wills are not yet legal in Italy.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This study describes the last month of life of severely demented patients living in RSAs. The sample is representative of the RSAs of the area surveyed; because of different regional rules, the organization and services provided to patients may vary from region to region.\nConcomitant illnesses are similar to those reported by other studies. 16,17 Symptoms such as fatigue and drowsiness, normally common in this type of population, were specified only in a limited number of clinical records, presumably because they are considered usual clinical features of the illness, therefore \"normal\" and expected. This may explain the differences from the study by Brandt et al., 16 in which the most frequent problems were generalized weaknesses, respiratory problems or dyspnea, and somnolence and fever, and were related to food or fluids inhalation\nThe prevalence of seizures was lower than the 10%-22% reported by Mendez and Lim. 18 A possible explanation is that the observation time was only the last month, not the whole duration of the disease, or that this symptom might have been underreported or gone unrecognized.\nAlmost half of the patients had pressure sores in the month before death, a high rate compared to figures reported for nursing homes residents in Holland, 16 for patients who died in Italian hospitals (27% had sores and 8.4% severe sores), 19 and for terminal demented patients (35%). 20 In general adequate attention was paid to physical suffering, as evidenced by the fairly widespread use of analgesics, especially opioids, in patients likely to be suffering pain, although there was wide variability among RSAs.\nBed-rails were used for more than half the patients on a permanent basis. The use of other forms of restraints (abdominal or limb restraints) was much less frequent (\u03fd 8%). Limb restraints were used for patients receiving intravenous therapy or with a nasogastric tube. Twenty-seven percent of patients were both restrained and given anxiolytics which in some cases could serve as chemical restraints even at low doses. Physical and chemical restraints could be indicators of ineffective management of pain or other distressing symptoms, which demented persons mostly express by restlessness. 21,22 We cannot say how many times relatives were actually involved in end-of -life decision making, but in any case, only rarely was the involvement recorded: documentation of these nonclinical aspects of care, with such profound ethical and legal implications, should be encouraged. Relatives have their own opinions on end-of-life decisions, and discussions should be encouraged and documented in clinical records.\nA philosophy of care of severe demented persons more oriented to \"aggressive\" than palliative treatment is confirmed not only by the use of life-sustaining intravenous drugs, CPR, and some diagnostics but also by other findings. In particular, the number of tube-fed patients, even if lower than in other studies, 11,[23][24][25] was still high, because tube feeding is considered ineffective in these patients and is often associated with negative outcomes. 3,9,12,26 DI GIULIO ET AL. 1026  The use of systemic antibiotics (more than 70% of patients) was also much more widespread than in other studies on severely demented end-of-life patients, 17 thus suggesting inappropriate administration/prescription 27,28 more than for symptom control. Also the use of anxiolytics and antidepressants is hard to justify in these severe patients.\nEven if in some cases intravenous hydration was used for intravenous drugs, hypodermoclysis, generally considered a less bothersome way to provide water, 29 was adopted only in approximately 15% of artificially hydrated patients.\nOxygen therapy by facial or nasal mask was remarkably widely used. Oxygen has been considered a \"palliative\" treatment, 17 but might well be futile or even \"aggressive\" when applied without documented hypoxia, since it can easily cause oxygen overload and unwanted effects, even worsening the dyspnea. 30 It is not easy to determine the inappropriateness of some interventions, because they depend on many factors: health care system, health care providers, relatives' wishes, lack of advanced directives, and cultural attitudes. As the study was carried out in the last month of life and there is no consensus on the definition of terminality in far-advanced dementia, it is likely that some vital decisions (tube feeding, antibiotics, etc.) were taken long before this time. Moreover, the reasons for certain decisions are only rarely reported in clinical records.\nA determination of appropriateness of care would require information on the time and reasons for prescriptions, treatments such as artificial feeding or drugs, and on the expected prognosis of the patient. Nevertheless, some findings, as the unacceptably high prevalence of bedsores, calls for prompt corrective measures.\nThe wide variety of attitudes toward tube feeding and strong opioids among RSAs and the lack of instruments for evaluating pain and/or distress show the different treatment philosophies and a shared lack of systematic assessment of patients' needs.\nThe data tend to confirm the \"aggressive\" treatment of demented patients, that severe dementia patients are not considered terminal, and reports from other countries. 4,6,17,31 The fact that dementia itself is never mentioned as cause of death implies that, unlike cancer or cardiac failure, 32,33 it is not considered an illness that causes death. This may partly explain why palliative care philosophy is not regularly adopted in the majority of patients, and an \"active\" treatment prevails. In general, \"cardiac arrest\" was reported as cause of death, confounding the last event of life with the process that actually started and led to death. This stresses the need, particularly for demented patients, for a careful medical culture sensitive to the problems of dying people, thus able to discriminate between the various the events concerning death.\nThe hindrances to any moves toward a palliative care culture cannot be blamed solely on physicians: decisions about withholding life-sustaining treatments, nutrition, and hydration are difficult in a setting in which cognitive impairment is combined with the total absence of any kind of advanced directives.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study Limits", "text": "The findings of the study are limited to severely demented patients; the aims and philosophy of care for less severe pa-tients may be different.

These findings suggest that end-of-life demented patients are not perceived as \"terminal,\" and do not always receive appropriate palliative care. This will further imply that, if \"nonpalliative\" treatment prevails and severe cases are treated as hospitalized patients, RSAs will be more and more similar to hospitals and this will require redesigning the organization and standards of personnel, thus unaffordably-and uselessly-increasing the costs of care, without necessarily improving either survival or quality of life.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This study was supported by grants from the Fondazione Banca Popolare di Cremona, which did not have any role in the design or conduction of the study, analysis of results, or preparation of the paper.\nThe study protocol was formulated independently by the investigators.

Objective: To examine geographic variation in patient and medical trainee access to hospital palliative care and to examine predictors of these programs. Methods: Primary and secondary analyses of national survey and census data. Hospital data including hospital palliative care programs were obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Data-base\u2122 for fiscal year 2006 supplemented by mailed surveys. Medical school-affiliated hospitals were obtained from the American Association of Medical Colleges, Web-site review, and telephone survey. Health care utilization data were obtained from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 2008. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify characteristics significantly associated with the presence of hospital palliative care. Results: A total of 52.8% of hospitals with 50 or more total facility beds reported hospital palliative care with considerable variation by state; 40.9% (144/352) of public hospitals, 20.3% (84/413) of for-profit hospitals, and 28.8% (160/554) of Medicare sole community providers reported hospital palliative care. A total of 84.5% of medical schools were associated with at least one hospital palliative care program. Factors significantly associated (p \u03fd 0.05) with hospital palliative care included geographic location, owning a hospice program, having an American College of Surgery approved cancer program, percent of persons in the county with a university education, and medical school affiliation. For-profit and public hospitals were significantly less likely to have hospital palliative care when compared with nonprofit institutions. States with higher hospital palliative care penetration rates were observed to have fewer Medicare hospital deaths, fewer intensive care unit/cardiac care unit (ICU/CCU) days and admissions during the last 6 months of life, fewer ICU/CCU admission during terminal hospitalizations, and lower overall Medicare spending/enrollee. Discussion: This study represents the most recent estimate to date of the prevalence of hospital palliative care in the United States. There is wide geographic variation in access to palliative care services although factors predicting hospital palliative care have not changed since 2005. Overall, medical students have high rates of access to hospital palliative care although complete penetration into academic settings has not occurred. The association between hospital palliative care penetration and lower Medicare costs is intriguing and deserving of further study.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P ALLIATIVE CARE provides high quality care for seriously ill patients and their families while making efficient use of hospital resources. 1 For patients to benefit from these services, however, hospital palliative care programs must be available locally within communities across the United States.

Supplemental data were provided through a mailed/faxed survey, telephone interviews of select medical school admission offices, and reviews of medical school websites as described below.\nHospital data. Data on hospital characteristics were obtained from the AHA Annual Survey Database\u2122 for Fiscal Year 2006. The AHA surveys all member and nonmember hospitals in the United States and its associated areas on an annual basis. Among the over 850 elements included in the survey, data are provided on the type of authority responsible for establishing policy concerning overall operation of the hospitals (federal government, nonfederal government, nongovernment not-for-profit, and for-profit,); clinical facilities and services offered by the hospitals (e.g., general medical-surgical care, pediatric care, various types of intensive care units, physical rehabilitation, psychiatric services, cardiac programs, acquired immune deficiency disease [AIDS] care, etc.); beds and utilization; revenues and expenses; and professional staffing levels. For facilities and services, the survey also requests information on the manner in which a service is provided (i.e., whether it is hospital owned, provided by the hospital's health system, network, and/or provided through a formal contract between the hospital and another provider).\nThe survey also queried hospitals as to the presence of a palliative care program. The survey defines a palliative care program as, \"an organized program providing specialized medical care, drugs or therapies for the management of acute or chronic pain and/or the control of symptoms administered by specially trained physicians and other clinicians; and supportive care services, such as counseling on advanced directives, spiritual care, and social services, to patients with advanced disease and their families.\" For this study, all hospitals reporting a program, regardless of whether it was being provided by the hospital, health system, or network, or provided through a contractual arrangement or joint venture with another provider (e.g., a hospice providing nonhospice palliative care to hospital patients), were coded as having an active program.

In addition to notable dis-parities in geographic availability, we further observed strikingly low rates of hospital palliative care in public and sole community provider hospitals.\nPublic and sole community provider hospitals often serve as the only option for medical care for uninsured patients and geographically isolated communities, respectively. Thus, our finding that the majority of these institutions lack palliative care services speaks to a disparity in access to comprehensive care for some of the sickest and most vulnerable patient populations. Indeed, based on our results, only 41% of public hospitals and less than 30% of sole community provider hospitals provide their patients with access to hospital palliative care. These data suggest that targeted efforts to enhance the development of palliative care programs in these environments are critically needed. The increasing data suggesting that palliative care programs not only improve quality of medical care for patients with serious illness, [7][8][9][10] but do so with lower associated hospital costs than usual care [11][12][13] provides dual incentives for states, cities, and the federal government to promote the development of hospital palliative care programs in these settings while reducing hospital and patient cost during hospitalization. State legislatures can play an important role in this process by providing funding to hospitals to attend educational and technical assistance programs focused on promoting the development of palliative care programs especially public and sole community provider hospitals.

First, the identification of hospital palliative care programs was based upon hospitals' self-report to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey\u2122 and it is possible that hospitals' answers to the survey were inaccurate. As a result of anecdotal reports of inaccuracies in our last report, we conducted an additional survey providing hospitals with the opportunity to correct the AHA survey and in particular, ensure that their hospital palliative care program was included in our results. Twenty percent of hospitals elected to respond to this survey. Of the nearly 900 hospitals that responded, over 80% agreed with the AHA's survey suggesting that the numbers that we report have strong validity.\nSecond, we have no information about the structure and quality of the programs that we identified. Specifically, using the data sources available to us, it was impossible to determine the administrative structure, size, and processes of care employed by these hospital palliative care programs and whether they were in compliance with the recently devel- oped National Quality Forum Framework for palliative care. Third, for the purposes of this study we limited our primary study population to hospitals containing 50 or more facility beds based upon the rationale that it is unlikely that smaller hospitals would have a patient population large enough to support a full interdisciplinary palliative care team as recommended by the National Consensus Project. 16 As a result of the limitations inherent in the AHA survey we were unable to report on the prevalence of pediatric palliative care programs. The AHA reports the presence of hospital palliative care programs through a single variable and does not provide additional information whether a pediatric palliative care program is also available at an institution. Separate analyses of children's hospitals are possible and should be addressed in the future.\nLast, while we have chosen to exclude federal hospitals from all analyses because of their mandate to reach 100% penetration of palliative care programs, 6 we acknowledge the importance of the VA hospitals as clinical teaching sites for medical students across the country. However, VA hospitals typically do not serve as the primary clinical teaching site for any medical school in the United States and as such,  Despite these limitations, the data presented in this study represent the most recent estimates of access to hospital palliative care by patients and medical students reported in the literature to date.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We have identified significant disparities in public and educational access to hospital palliative care services.

One week later, Session 2 focused on issues of forgiveness, things they would have done differently, things left unsaid or undone. In the final week, Session 3 focused on lessons learned, heritage, and legacy. To ensure replicability, the interventionist followed the questions outlined in the training manual. Probes were limited to asking if participants had more to add to each specific topic (Table 1).\nSubjects in the second group (\"relaxation meditation\") also met with a facilitator, on three occasions, spaced a week apart, for a period of 45 minutes each and listened to a nonguided relaxation tape. The second group, led by a facilitator and with session time equivalence, was essential to demonstrating that the effects of \"treatment\" were not simply a result of greater attention but, in fact, due to the in-tervention content of end-of-life preparation and life completion tasks. The third group of participants (\"no intervention\"-true control) was not contacted between preassessment and postassessment. One week and 2 weeks after the three sessions (or their timing equivalent, for controls), participants in all groups completed posttest measures.

Eighty-two patients enrolled in the study and 42 completed all data points. Of the 82 enrolled patients, 38 were women, 35 were African American. Forty-eight patients entered the study with a primary diagnosis of cancer, 5 with heart disease, 10 with lung disease, and 19 with other illnesses such as endstage renal disease or neurodegenerative disease. Forty-eight were from Duke Hospital, 18 from local hospices, and 15 from the VA. In addition, 40% of the sample was married, 30% divorced, 12% widowed, and 13% never married. There was a breadth of educational background where 15% had less than a high school education, 47% graduated high school; 17% had some college, 9% were college graduates, and 11% had a graduate or professional degree. Ages ranged  2), and, with attrition, the life completion intervention arm included 9 participants, relaxation meditation 11 participants, and control 16 participants. Because all participants were at the very end of life, attrition was due to severe functional decline (e.g. losing consciousness), or death. Differences in attrition by group were not thought to be associated with the intervention content or participation.\nIntervention participants showed improvements in functional status, anxiety, depression, and preparation for end of life (a QUAL-E domain). For those in the intervention arm, functional status improved from a total score of 26.1 to 22.7, compared to attention control (26.3 to 24.8) and true control (28.4 to 28.3). Anxiety decreased among intervention patients from 6.4 to 3.7 as compared with anxiety increases in those in attention control (4.4 to 5.0) and true control (4.4 to 5.6).\nSimilarly, intervention participants' depression scores decreased (11.8 to 9.1) whereas attention control subjects' depressive symptoms were the same (10.1 to 10.0) and true control participant scores worsened (10.7 to 11.9).

Several patientlevel characteristics were associated with differential rates of dropout. Patients who were widowed, older age, had lower daily spiritual experience scores, had lung disease, and were referred from hospice or home health care all were more likely to not complete the study (either due to illness or death). Including these predictors of dropout in the estimation of the main study outcomes relaxes the missing data assumption to missing at random (MAR).

Furthermore, patients participated with similar facility regardless of broad variation in social background and socioeconomic status. The intervention was conducted successfully by a nonphysician clinician demonstrating the usefulness of multi-disciplinary team. The results of this paper suggest discussions of preparation and life completion influence patient symptoms and quality of life among persons with advanced life-limiting illness.\nSample size was not large enough to demonstrate statistical significance; however, participants in the active discussion intervention showed improvements in functional status, anxiety, depression, and preparation for end of life (a QUAL-E domain). The life review literature cites improvements in depressive symptomatology as a consistent outcome. 12,13 Similar trends from this study extend that work to the arena of end-of-life. In contrast, anxiety is not frequently assessed in life review randomized control trials. However, because many patients with advanced serious illness struggle with anxiety, finding interventions, like Outlook, that may improve that symptom will add to palliative clinicians' armamentarium. We also saw positive trends in functional status. For patients approaching the end of life, maintaining or improving independence and one's ability to care for oneself is highly valued by patients and families 4 and palliative care clinicians and researchers emphasize maximizing functional status as a key outcome for seriously ill and dying patients. Similarly, patients and families, identify preparation as a central domain of quality at end of life. 4,5 The preparation subscale, which measures issues of regret, burden, and things done differently, showed positive movement in the intervention group.\nWe did not see changes in the QUAL-E subscale measuring relationships with health care provider or in the completion subscale. The completion subscale includes items measuring both internal completion (e.g., coming to peace) and external completion (e.g., saying important things to family). The stability in this measure may be due to the individual items which assessed sense of having a chance to say good-bye, feeling at peace, having someone with whom they could share their deepest thoughts and feeling that they were able to share important things with others. These items encompassed external expressions of completion and may not have tapped strongly the internal sense. The small sample size may have affected our ability to see differences. In a fuller test of the intervention, we will include an assessment of internally gauged faith and purpose. It may be that the post-tests did not have enough time from intervention to test change. Furthermore, it is possible that expectations changed due to the intervention resulting in response shifts that confounded the ability of the subscale to detect real change.\nPrevious tests of life review demonstrate improvements in anxiety, depression and quality of life. Our newly designed intervention included similar content, but also extended the literature in at least two important ways. Similar to the structure of other life review interventions, the first session focused on the past with discussion of biographical context, accomplishments, and cherished times. In the second session, we extended the life review content to probe in depth about issues of regret and forgiveness. Recent literature has begun to explore the centrality of this topic to overall quality of life.\nSeveral studies have looked at the direct link between forgiveness and physical health. 31,[32][33][34][35] Although little is known empirically about the relationship between forgiveness and health, theorists suggest that forgiveness reduces hostility, and therefore should be related to: (1) a decrease in chronic blaming, anger, and hostility; (2) self-efficacy to take healthrelated actions; (3) social support; and (4) transcendent consciousness. 36,37 Although in its infancy, this literature has demonstrated forgiveness to be negatively correlated with poor health habits. Most importantly and relevant to the findings presented here, increases in forgiveness have been correlated with less negative affect, such as anxiety and depression. [32][33][34] The preparation subscale, which measures regret, did show improvements for those in the intervention arm.\nIn a second departure from many life review interventions, the intervention session provided participants with an opportunity to discuss their heritage and legacy and therefore ending with a future orientation. Involvement in discussions of lessons learned and wisdom to be shared with the next generation (Table 1) coincides with findings from previous studies documenting the importance of contributing to others as a central feature of quality at the end of life. Providing an opportunity to look forward and set goals for the future supports the human development model and assumes that personal growth may occur through out all stages of life. Indeed, participants in this study were within weeks and sometimes days of death.\nIn recent years, Chochinov et al. 38 have developed and tested a meaning-making intervention \"dignity therapy\" for those with terminal illness (particularly patients with advanced cancer). Participants complete eight sessions and produce a \"generativity document\" that is transcribed and made into hard copy. In their qualitative work to develop the intervention, the authors identify core components of dignity preserving perspectives and dignity preserving practices. The former includes: continuity of self, role preservation, generativity/legacy, maintenance of pride, hopefulness, autonomy/control, acceptance, and resistance. Related practices attend to living in the moment, maintaining normalcy, and seeking spiritual support. These topics are addressed explicitly in six clinician-guided sessions. Interestingly, in the process of exploring life review, forgiveness and heritage and legacy, participants in our study came to address similar topics but through a briefer, more self-guided approach. This lends credence to viewing life review as a necessary developmental task that emerges at end of life, or may be forced to emerge with the challenges of life-limiting illness. Our intervention differs by being briefer and not producing a document. Findings suggest that the power of bearing witness, may prove equally powerful. In the handouts, participants were encouraged to develop legacy items, be they photo albums, letters, or other meaningful and tangible forms of legacy.\nThere were several limitations associated with the study. As noted, approximately 50% of participants were not able to complete the study due to functional decline or death. Dropout was particularly notable among hospice referrals, where the local lengths of stay mirror the short national median lengths of stay at approximately 15 days. 50 High attrition also is likely related to clinician prognostication, which when identifying patients with less the 6 months to live, often yields samples of patients with weeks to live. 51 Future intervention may extend the inclusion criteria to patients with advanced life limiting illness, as indicated by clinical criteria.\nNational consensus panels and a variety of clinicians and researchers have called for interventions to help seriously ill patients address issues of spirituality, meaning, and life review. The data from this pilot study suggest that Outlook is a brief, transportable, manualized intervention acceptable to patients from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and may be a useful means of addressing emotional and existential issues for patients at the end of life.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We wish to thank Belleruth Naparstek and Bruce Gigax for their work in developing the relaxation meditation language and music.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.

If so, to learn about specific concerns adolescents and young adults feel are important to include in such a document. Methods: Adolescents and young adults with metastatic cancer or pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection were presented Five Wishes \u00ae , an advance directive document for adults. Each participant was asked to critically evaluate each wish in terms of whether the concepts within were considered (1) appropriate to ask individuals the participant's age; (2) helpful for other people the participant's age to think about; (3) helpful to the participant to think about; (4) stressful to contemplate.

[1][2][3] The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Institute of Medicine recommend that children, adolescents, and young adults with a life-limiting illness be involved in the palliative care and decision-making process as much as possible and in a developmentally appropriate manner. 1,2 Previous interviews with adolescent chronically ill patients have shown that this population is able and willing to take part in conversations about palliative care. [4][5][6] While chronically ill adolescents and young adults express a strong desire to share in medical decision-making if they are very ill, 5 nurses, 7 doctors, 8,9 and parents 10 often report discomfort with initiating EOL discussions with this population. In addition, there is concern among adults that speaking about death and dying with seriously ill young patients would be too stressful and may counteract the \"culture of hope\" present in pediatric and adolescent medical settings. 8 While the ability of advance directives to capture patient preferences has been debated, 11,12 it is generally believed that advance care planning documents may aid in initiating EOL discussions between patients, families, and clinicians.\nComprehensive and sensitive EOL documents exist for the adult population, yet no planning guides are currently available to aid in palliative care discussions with adolescents and young adults. Prior studies with seriously ill adolescent and young adult populations have provided valuable information on EOL preferences, but most of the literature has been primarily anecdotal in nature. 13 Furthermore, a number of important areas have not yet been explored. It is not known how the personal wishes of adolescents and young adults can best be expressed to family and staff, or which specific topics should be addressed in EOL discussions.

In the event that a participant expressed discomfort with any of the options (thus, did not meet the readiness criteria), they were asked if they would feel comfortable being contacted for follow-up in a month to determine if they were more willing at that time to discuss EOL issues. If they were not, their involvement in the study was completed.\nInterviews evaluating Five Wishes \u00ae concepts were conducted by one of three members of the research team, all of whom received training in clinical interviewing techniques and the study documents. Participants who met readiness criteria read through Five Wishes \u00ae and were asked whether each question was: (1) appropriate to ask individuals the participant's age; (2) helpful for other people the participant's age to think about; (3) helpful for the participant to think about; and (4) stressful to contemplate. Responses were based on a Likert scale of 1 to 5. Participants were then asked if there were statements or questions they would remove from the document or if there were items they would add to it. Participants were not asked to answer the questions for themselves; rather, they were asked only to evaluate the concepts within the document for their appropriateness, helpfulness, and stressfulness. Participants then evaluated the items generated from prior clinical sessions, rating their appropriateness and helpfulness.

Forty-percent (n \u03ed 8) of participants described reviewing this wish as \"stressful\" or \"very stressful.\" Many participants were confused by the language (i.e., \"end stage condition\") and felt that there were too many medical conditions listed. There were several suggestions to make this section more open-ended (i.e., \"Thoughts about what I would like my doctor to do or not do\"). Forty percent (n \u03ed 8) of participants found Wish 5 (My Wish for What I Want My Loved Ones to Know) to be the most helpful. Many participants were particularly interested in the statements referring to the offer of love and forgiveness to family and friends, planning their memorial service, and indicating ways they could be remembered after their death.\nWhen asked what changes they would make to the document, participants wanted to remove the phrase \"health care agent,\" citing it to be unclear and impersonal. An alternative of \"chosen responsible adult\" was suggested. Furthermore, several participants reported discomfort with identifying only one individual to make health care decisions, preferring that additional family members be involved in any decision making. Concerns about assisted living, hospice, and nursing home care, and medical record release were not considered to be a high priority to this population. Several participants suggested that the questions addressing pain were limiting and there was a desire to be able to balance pain control with \"being drowsy.\" Participants were particularly interested in issues of personal comfort and wanted to add questions about who and what they wanted around them at the end-of-life, including visitors, personal items, music, and food. Formatting changes included having more open-ended statements (e.g. \"I wish for my family and friends to know that this is how I view death . . . \" \"The things most important to me before this illness were . . . \" \"The things most important to me now are . . . \") and more space for elaborating on their wishes. Suggestions were made to create an open-ended section where a letter could be written to loved ones. Other format changes involved the religious/spiritual questions that are included throughout Five Wishes \u00ae . Some participants welcomed the opportunity to ask for supportive spiritual guidance while others were uncomfortable with these items. A suggestion was made to have a separate section on religious and spiritual questions that would be optional to complete.\nThe participants' responses to the clinically generated items provided further insight and feedback on the usefulness of an age-appropriate EOL document. All of the statements were endorsed as helpful to themselves and others their age living with life-limiting illness. These topics included where they would like to be at the end of their life, final arrangements, bequeathing their belongings, and how they would like to be remembered after their death.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first examination and critique of the usefulness of an advance care planning document by adolescents and young adults living with a life-limiting illness. These results provide additional empirical support that adolescents and young adults are open and interested in discussing their EOL care. The nearly universal finding that such a document would be useful, appropriate, helpful, and minimally stressful is particularly important for future clinical care and research endeavors.\nAdvance directives like Five Wishes \u00ae often address a broad range of treatment options ranging from relatively non-invasive procedures to mechanical ventilation. Our participants appeared to be more interested in items regarding how they want to be treated and remembered, and having an opportunity to express concern for those they will leave behind, than they were about items related to legalities, medical decision-making, and life-support treatments. Adolescents may be less concerned with medical decision-making due to difficulties in understanding legal language and concepts, but it is also possible that participants treated in a pediatric facility would rely on their parents to make such decisions for them. Regardless, adolescents and young adults report that end-of-life topics are difficult to discuss with family and friends. 14,15 While all participants endorsed the statement that talking about end-of-life care is important, only 45% reported that they had discussed these thoughts with their parents in the month prior to when the study interview was conducted. Having an advance care planning document could foster discussion with family and friends, and could facilitate communication between the primary health care provider and the adolescent or young adult regarding their personal goals, values, or beliefs. As such, EOL conversations in the context of completing a planning document might increase communication, reduce isolation, and have a positive therapeutic effect.\nThis study had several limitations. First, our sample size was small. Since we were unsure how adolescents and young adults would respond to questions about an EOL document, a sample size of 20 patients was believed to be adequate to gain qualitative data for this exploratory study. This did not afford adequate power to conduct statistical testing between age groups or disease type. In addition to the small sample size, the specific inclusion criteria may limit the generalization of our findings. Study participation included adolescents and young adults with cancer or HIV infection, who had good performance status and were enrolled in research protocols. Future investigations with advance care planning tools will benefit from larger cohorts, the addition of individuals with different chronic and serious illnesses, and individuals with lower performance status and/or those not enrolled in a research study. Also, in planning for this study, a Readiness Assessment was created to protect individuals who were not comfortable discussing issues associated with end-of-life care. Reliability or validity of the three questions was not assessed prior to the study onset. Since a screening measure that could assess a young person's readiness to complete an advanced care planning guide could be a very useful tool, future research would benefit from investigating the psychometrics of such an instrument. Last, a limitation and perhaps also an advantage of this investigation is that participants were not asked to complete Five Wishes \u00ae , but rather to examine it as a \"consultant,\" which may have led to a less stressful experience. This caveat may have also led to the ability to obtain such rich information. Despite these limitations, the excellent study participation rate, and the nearly universal report by the participants that an advance care planning document would be useful and appropriate for someone their age is a particularly striking finding. The comments received from participants will lead to the creation of a developmentally appropriate document to be used in future validation studies. Future studies would benefit from evaluating how adolescents and young adults understand terms like cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, hospice and hospice care and how adolescents younger than age 16 would respond to reviewing an EOL planning document. Moreover, there has been no research on the willingness of adolescents or young adults to complete an advance care planning document or the impact of doing so on decision-making at the end of life. It is critical that future studies investigate whether having an advance care planning guide allows the individuals' preferences to be known and honored.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "A developmentally appropriate advance care planning document may play an important role in the care of seriously ill adolescents and young adults.

There are limited data on the characteristics and correlates of dyspnea in this population. The purpose of this study was to characterize dyspnea, explore the differences between breakthrough and continuous presentations, and to determine factors associated with its intensity. Methods: Prospective observational study among 70 patients with dyspnea referred to a palliative care service. Dyspnea was assessed using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS, 0-10) and the Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD). Oximetry, pulmonary function tests, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a detailed systematic evaluation of daily characteristics of dyspnea were performed. Other symptoms were recorded using the ESAS. Results: Of 30 patients, 70 (43%) were female, median age was 58 (range, 28-87), and the most frequent cancer diagnosis were lung (31/70; 44%) and urologic (15/70; 21%). Constant dyspnea occurred in 27 of 70 (39%) patients, with 14 of 70 (20%) presenting breakthrough episodes. Breakthrough-only dyspnea occurred in 43 of 70 (61%). The majority of patients with breakthrough episodes (39/57; 68%) presented fewer than 5 episodes daily, most frequently lasting for less than 10 minutes (50/57; 88%).

Bruera et al. 5 found that the intensity of dyspnea is associated to anxiety, maximal inspiratory pressure and lung involvement. Studies conducted by Dudgeon and colleagues 15,16 in terminally ill patients with cancer and in outpatients with cancer with moderate to severe dyspnea observed that anxiety, history of smoking, and perhaps maximum inspiratory pressure were associated to the intensity of dyspnea reported using a visual analogue scale. A study by Heyse-Moore et al. 17 of 150 patients with advanced cancer showed, however, that there was low correlation between dyspnea scores and spirometry. In a study by Tanaka et al. 7 in outpatients with cancer, dyspnea was significantly correlated with psychological distress and presence of organic causes, cough, and pain. Another study conducted by the same group observed that dyspnea also interfered with activities of daily living. 18 A recently published study with 954 patients reported that the presence of dyspnea can negatively impact the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. 19 The aim of this preliminary descriptive study was to characterize dyspnea, including the differences between breakthrough and continuous presentations, and to determine factors correlated with the intensity of dyspnea.", "n_publication_ref": 23, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "The study was approved by the University of Texas M.

The patient rates the intensity of the symptoms on a numerical scale ranging from 0 (\"no symptom\") to 10 (\"worst symptom imaginable\"). 21 This assessment is widely used and has been validated in the cancer patient population. 24 The Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD) was used to evaluate dyspnea on exertion and activities of daily living. It consists of a vertical scale of 100 mm with descriptive anchoring statements in distinct points, corresponding to the oxygen requirements for a variety of activities (the statements are: \"brisk walking uphill,\" \"medium walking uphill,\" \"brisk walking on the level,\" \"slow walking uphill,\" \"heavy shopping,\" \"medium walking,\" \"bed making,\" \"light shopping,\" \"washing yourself,\" \"slow walking on the level,\" \"standing,\" \"sitting,\" and \"sleeping\"). The patient is instructed to \"mark the line at a point above which you would become breathless,\" and the OCD score is defined by measuring the distance from the bottom of the scale to the patient's mark. This provides a quantification of the patient's dyspnea. 25 The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire (equally divided between the anxiety and depression subscales) in which each item is graded by the patient in a 0-3 scale with variable anchoring statements. The sum score of each subscale ranges from 0 to 21. 26 It has been extensively validated in various populations, including patients with cancer. 27,28 We considered scores of 1-7 as mild depression or anxiety; 8-14 as moderate depression or anxiety; and 15-21 as severe depression or anxiety. Patients who scored 8 or more in any of the HADS subscales were considered as having psychological distress.\nIn addition, the authors asked the patients questions regarding the characteristics of dyspnea using an ad hoc questionnaire. The initial screening question was, \"How often are you short of breath?\" Possible answers to the screening question were: \"All of the time,\" \"Most of the time,\" \"Some of the time,\" and \"A little of the time.\" Participants who selected one of the first two answers were considered as having predominantly \"continuous dyspnea\" and the ones who selected one of the last two answers were considered as having predominantly \"breakthrough dyspnea\" (BTD). A breakthrough episode was defined as \"a clinically significant aggravation of dyspnea in patients with continuous dyspnea or occurring intermittently,\" and all patients were asked about the presence of such episodes. A series of other questions were asked concerning worsening and relieving factors, duration, frequency, severity, timing, concurrent symptoms, and descriptors. Modifying questions from the Brief Pain Inventory, 29 we included questions about daily living activities such as interference on general activity, mood, walking ability, work, interpersonal relations, sleep, and enjoyment of life.\nPulmonary function tests (PFT) included vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory vital capacity in 1 second (FEV 1 ), peak flow rate (PFR), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) using Futuremed Spirometer (Futuremed America Inc., Granada Hills, CA).

Our study identifies cancer dyspnea as a predominant breakthrough symptom, with more than 80% of the patients experiencing breakthrough episodes. Another group found breakthrough dyspnea to be present in 30% of patients in a trial of midazolam and morphine to treat dyspnea. However, in this study breakthrough dyspnea was defined based on the need for rescue medication to treat dyspnea. 32 This difference in assessment criteria could explain the difference in the incidence between the two studies. We believe that the assessment and definition of breakthrough dyspnea by the patients' complaints is a more accurate way of finding the frequency of this symptom presentation. 33 In our study, we found a number of patients with a constant dyspnea pattern who did not report episodes of aggravation. Clinically, one should expect at least some episodes of aggravation, which did not occur with these patients in our small sample. It may be due to misinterpretation of our questionnaire or because continuous dyspnea was perceived as so severe that the breakthrough episodes were not considered as a distinct entity.\nBreakthrough dyspnea was of shorter duration and occurred on an average 5-6 times per day in most patients. This finding is significant since breakthrough dyspnea of very short duration need different treatment and assessment algorithms compared to dyspnea present at all times (constant dyspnea). The duration of the episodes in majority of the patients was less than 5 minutes, being too short to allow for relief even by administration of extremely short-acting opioids such as oral transmucosal fentanyl or intravenous morphine. Parenteral morphine is reported to have an onset of action around 15 to 20 minutes, 34,35 also too long to relieve a 5-minute episode of breakthrough dyspnea. However, the constant dyspnea with breakthrough episodes still occurred in a subset of patients, suggesting treatment with sustainedrelease opioids to decrease the intensity of both constant and breakthrough episodes. In addition, preventative therapy with a short-acting opioid before the anticipated development of a breakthrough episode may prove to be useful. A prospective double-blinded study to test this hypothesis should be done in future studies. Benitez-Rosario et al. 36 reported four advanced cancer cases in which patients' breakthrough dyspnea episodes were treated with oral transmucosal fentanyl, reporting improvements of 40%-50% in a range of 12 to 30 minutes. This needs to be further explored in a randomized double-blinded trial.\nOur study also looked into the interference of functions in patients with dyspnea. The majority of the study population presented with good functional status, despite the presence of dyspnea. This might be due to a number of reasons. Most patients in our study were seen in the ambulatory setting, and hence were more functional. Another reason could be that we have included patients even with dyspnea 1/10 and most of the time it was not the presenting symptom. Also, our study excluded patients with delirium, who tend to have lower functional status. Dyspnea had a significant negative impact on activities of daily living in most categories (Table 4, Fig. 1). The interference of activities in patients with dyspnea were previously noted by Tanaka et al. 18 They showed REDDY ET AL. 32 that dyspnea could influence at least one activity of daily living in more than half of the patients. They concluded that if dyspnea and fatigue coexisted the negative influence on physical activities of daily living, such as walking and working were profound. They also found that pain influenced at least one activity in 40% of the patients, but influenced physical and nonphysical (such as mood and enjoyment of life) variables equally. 18 Our study noted that as the intensity of dyspnea increased, the interference on most functions also increased (Table 4). In our cohort, constant dyspnea with breakthrough category showed worse interference in function compared to breakthrough-only category, indicating that patients in the latter category have better quality of life. This group might particularly benefit from preventative treatments with opioids and other measures. This is an interesting phenomenon that needs to be further studied in the cancer patient population (Table 3).\nOur survey to find the presence of breakthrough dyspnea was motivated by similar studies in breakthrough pain. However, we found the two symptoms are different both clinically and with regards to treatment response, even though they share some aspects in terms of frequency and duration. 37,38 Breakthrough dyspnea with very short duration of the episodes and modest response to opioid medica-", "n_publication_ref": 11, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "DYSPNEA IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER 33", "text": "FIG. 1. Median of interference in different daily living activities according to the severity of dyspnea defined by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score.\ntions pose greater challenge to treat than breakthrough pain. 39 Also, dyspnea interfered with some functions even at low intensity in some patients, as opposed to patients with pain. Cleeland et al. 29 found that in patients with cancer pain, function starts to deteriorate only at the pain intensity of 4 and above, on a 0-10 scale. Our findings suggest that even at low intensity of dyspnea, the function starts to compromise, indicating the need to aggressively treat dyspnea even at low intensities. These differences may also exist between constant dyspnea and constant pain. Unlike constant pain, dyspnea as a sole symptom continues to pose a therapeutic challenge. In our multivariate analysis, pain was correlated with the intensity of dyspnea. There is evidence that pain may cause dyspnea due to an increase in ventilatory drive, 40 triggering hyperventilation, but in chronic pain this phenomenon may not be seen. Since it is well known that breakthrough pain is common in patients with cancer this raises the question whether a breakthrough pain episode triggers the sensation of breakthrough dyspnea. This phenomenon was not possible to analyze due to the nature of our study, but would make an interesting future development. There is no evidence that improving chronic pain will lead to improved sensation of dyspnea. Fatigue is the most common symptom in patients with advanced cancer. 41 In our study, it was correlated with dyspnea both in univariate and multivariate analyses. Fatigue may lead to both constant, but more so to breakthrough dyspnea. Perhaps addressing fatigue may partially reverse the process of breakthrough dyspnea.\nAnxiety, depression, and the overall sense of well-being were correlated with dyspnea as shown previously. 6,18 Anxiety and dyspnea are interwoven and the uncomfortable and suffocating feeling of inability to breathe perhaps results in anxiety. However, a preexisting anxiety disorder also may evoke dyspnea, which in turn sets in more anxiety, leading to a vicious cycle. Our multivariate analysis showed a trend towards correlation between dyspnea and anxiety. Anxiolytics may not always improve dyspnea, indicating that anxiety may not be the direct cause of dyspnea. However, they may help to break the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression. Other nonpharmacologic efforts proven to reduce anxiety may also improve dyspnea. 42,43 Depression was also correlated with the intensity of dyspnea in our study, confirming similar results by other investigators. 7,44 The OCD, which indicated the graded activities with effort, was strongly correlated with depression, again indicating that mood disorders are commonly associated with dyspnea. The refractory nature of dyspnea, coupled with social isolation may lead patients to withdraw and lose motivation to participate in important family and social events, thereby leading to depressive mood. Therefore, it is imperative to assess and manage depression in patients with dyspnea. Depression and anxiety may lead a patient to somatization, and the expression of dyspnea may be amplified. Relaxation techniques along with expressive supportive counseling may have a positive impact to decrease intensity of dyspnea and its expression.\nThe OCD may be a practical tool to use to better describe breakthrough dyspnea, allowing patients to relate the kind of activity that brings on dyspnea and quantifying it on a 100 mm line that represents the oxygen requirements for that specific task. As expected, the OCD was significantly correlated with intensity of dyspnea, fatigue, and vital capacity. The combination of the OCD with ESAS, along with some questions from our survey could allow a better understanding of breakthrough dyspnea, in terms of the causes and intensity of the symptom, in accordance to the latest recommendations regarding cancer dyspnea assessment. 33 Pulmonary function tests, generally do not tell the story of dyspnea symptom, 45 but they do give the information about the reversible component of dyspnea. In the previous studies, 5,6 maximal inspiratory pressure was correlated with the intensity of dyspnea, but in our study multivariate analysis did not reveal such correlation. This was a surprising finding because fatigue was closely correlated, and in patients with fatigue maximal inspiratory pressure should be REDDY ET AL. 34  ", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Continuous dyspnea Breakthrough dyspnea", "text": "lower. In our study only 61 of 74 patients could complete the maximal inspiratory pressure test because of fatigue and lack of motivation. This could have had a negative influence in our results, and might explain the lack of correlation between dyspnea and maximal inspiratory pressure.\nOur study met with some difficulties in terms of enrollment. We excluded patients with obvious causes of dyspnea, and this made it difficult to enroll patients as planned. Also dyspnea becomes evident only in late trajectory of the illness, very likely during the last hours or days of life, when patients already have a number of major associated symptoms including delirium, making their participation in clinical trials of this symptom very difficult. These reasons support the difficulty in identifying patients for dyspnea clinical trials as previously reported by other authors. 46,47 These logistical issues restricted the enrollment number as well as delayed our study. Although this reduces our power to detect differences, we still had the ability to estimate proportions with a standard error no greater than 6% (and confidence intervals no larger than the estimated proportion \u03ee12%), and to detect correlation coefficients between dyspnea ratings and other continuous variables of 0.33 or greater, assuming a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% power.\nNevertheless the analysis from our limited number of study population yielded some interesting clinical findings in terms of identifying a new phenomenon of breakthrough dyspnea, and interference of function in the presence of dyspnea. Dyspnea is a multidimensional construct commonly occurring with a cluster of other symptoms, requiring a multimodality approach. Traditional pharmacologic approaches will be ineffective in most patients with breakthrough dyspnea. Perhaps multidisciplinary combined approaches involving opioids, fatigue management, relaxation techniques, as well as psychosomatic interventions may yield better results. Our findings should form the basis for future evidencebased research both in terms of improving treatment of breakthrough dyspnea as well as to improve function and quality of life in patients with dyspnea.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Dyspnea is a frequent symptom in patients with advanced cancer.

Approximately 180,000 women in the United States are diagnosed each year with invasive breast cancer and more than 40,000 women will die from the disease this year. 1 As with other serious illnesses, cancer poses profound physical and psychological challenges. Religion is a common way to cope with these challenges. 2 For example, Johnson and Spilka 3 reported that 85% of women with breast cancer turned to religion to cope.\nReligious coping can be conceptualized in different ways. Most studies assess the frequency of church attendance or prayer, with the assumption that these behaviors are a response to the stressors in question. 4 The problem with this assumption is that global measures of religious involvement may reflect dispositional religiousness rather than how people draw from religion during crises. 5 Another method involves determining the degree to which religion is involved in coping (e.g., ''How important is religion for coping with _____?''). 5 Some scales include religious items that are subsumed by a broader dimension of coping. For example, the Ways of Coping Scale includes two religious items ''found new faith'' and ''I prayed,'' that are part of a ''Positive Reappraisal'' coping factor. 6 Finally, some scales, such as the Religious=Spiritual Coping Scale (RCOPE), assess a range of coping methods, which can be categorized as positive or negative. 7 Positive religious coping (e.g., benevolent religious appraisals, religious forgiveness, etc.) reflects a secure relationship with God and is associated with improved quality of life in persons with cancer. 8 In contrast, negative religious coping (e.g., reappraisals of God's powers, feeling abandoned or punished by God, etc.) reflects a tenuous relationship with God and is associated with worse well-being in people with cancer. 9,10 Unlike dispositional measures of religiousness, these measures focus more specifically on how people actually use religion in times of crisis. 11 Studies exploring religious coping are few in number, however, and with rare exceptions, have focused on the positive aspects of religious coping. 8,12 The authors of a recent review concluded, therefore, that the literature does not allow for definitive conclusions about the effects of religious coping on the well-being of patients with cancer. 13 Their conclusion was based on the fact that the majority of studies 1) were cross-sectional; 2) rarely used validated measures of religious coping; and 3) failed to control for potential covariates such as social support and stage of disease. This study addresses some of these limitations.\nThe purpose of this study was to test whether changes in positive and negative religious coping in women with breast cancer predict changes in well-being over time. We expected that greater use of positive religious coping would be associated with greater well-being, whereas greater use of negative coping would be associated with lower well-being. Because negative religious coping may be more strongly associated with health outcomes than is positive religious coping, we hypothesized that negative religious coping would be more consistently predictive of well-being. 14 In addition, work suggests that religious involvement may have stronger positive effects on mental health among people confronting higher levels of stress. 15,16 We therefore explored whether the relationship between religious coping and well-being was moderated by cancer stage.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "Participants were enrolled in the Breast Cancer Interventions Study of the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center.

Personality attributes: neuroticism was assessed because of its influence on self-reported health. 18 The variable was collected as a part of global personality assessment using a 25-item version of Goldberg's Adjective Scale. 19 A neuroticism score (range, 5-25; mean \u00bc 9.7; SD \u00bc 3.4; Cronbach a \u00bc 0.89) was calculated by summing respondents' agreement with five statements. Higher scores indicated more neuroticism. We also measured hostility, or participants' cynical, mistrustful, and aggressive attitudes towards others, because of its association with worse quality of life in women with breast cancer. 20 Hostility was assessed with a 20-item version of the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale. 21 (mean \u00bc 6.2; SD \u00bc 3.2; Cronbach a \u00bc 0.67). Higher scores indicated higher levels of hostility. Religiosity: Because religion is a multidimensional construct, religiosity was defined as a composite measure of religious attendance (How often do you attend religious services?), frequency of prayer (How often do you pray=meditate in places other than religious buildings?), and level of religious and spiritual feelings (To what extent do you consider yourself to be a religious= spiritual person?). These measures can be combined into a reliable scale. 22 Because the items had different response scales, Z scores were computed and summed to obtain a composite score (M \u00bc 0 [Z scores] SD \u00bc 3.2; Cronbach a \u00bc 0.83). Intervention group assignment: The parent study was an intervention study in which participants were assigned to an educational intervention, peer support, or treatment as usual control group. The education group was taught adaptive coping strategies and stress management whereas women in the peer support group were encouraged to share their experiences. Both interventions were an hour a week for eight weeks. All analyses were first conducted with an intervention variable (two dummy variables comparing each intervention condition to the control condition). Since the intervention was not related to any of the outcomes and there is no theoretical basis for including it in the analyses, this variable was dropped from further analyses.\nPredictor variables: Religious coping. Religious coping was measured with four items taken from the RCOPE scale. 7 Items were scored on a 4-point Likert scale: 1 \u00bc not at all, 2 \u00bc somewhat, 3 \u00bc quite a bit, 4 \u00bc a great deal. Positive religious coping was scored as the mean of two statements: (1) I've been working together with God as partners to get through this problem and (2) I've been looking to God for strength, support, and guidance (mean \u00bc 3.2; SD \u00bc 0.9). Negative religious coping was scored as the mean of two statements: (1) I've been wondering if God has abandoned me and (2) I've been expressing anger at God for letting this happen to me (mean \u00bc 1.2; SD \u00bc 0.4). Factor analysis yielded two coping factors: Cope with God (i.e., positive religious coping) and Cope Anger (i.e., negative religious coping).", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "538", "text": "HEBERT ET AL.\nReligious coping was assessed at T1 and T2 (8 to 12 months after study entry).\nOutcome variables. The following variables were chosen for study because of their theoretical link to religion. 23 Overall physical and mental well-being: Assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36). 24 Responses were summarized to produce two summary components, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Higher scores indicated better selfreported health. Depression: The frequency with which patients experienced depressive symptoms within the past week was measured with the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) 25 (range, 0-30, mean \u00bc 5; SD \u00bc 4.6; Cronbach a \u00bc 0.82). The 10-item version of the CES-D is highly correlated with the 20-item version (r \u00bc 0.96) with little loss in sensitivity, specificity, or internal reliability. 26 Higher scores indicated more depressive symptoms.

Second, T2 religious coping was introduced in the model to identify the extent to which changes in religious coping predicted changes in well-being.\nFinally, we explored the impact of cancer stage on religious coping and well-being.

Next we performed a series of 2\u00c22 repeated measures analyses of variance (ANCOVAs) to assess the impact of cancer stage on religious coping and well-being over time.

Three major findings emerged. First, negative religious coping, conceptualized as Cope Anger (i.e., wondering if God has abandoned me and expressing anger at God) predicted worse overall mental health, more depression, and less life satisfaction. Changes in Cope Anger predicted worsening mental health, increases in depressive symptoms, and decreases in life satisfaction over time. The effect sizes demonstrated (i.e., negative religious coping explained approximately 2% of the variance in well-being) were consistent with those found with other coping strategies and health outcomes. 30 Second, positive religious coping (i.e., working together with God as partners and looking to God for strength, support, and guidance) had no association with well-being. Third, although the early stage patients had improved physical health and depression from study entry to follow-up, cancer stage did not moderate the relationships between religious coping and well-being.\nOur results are consistent with other studies showing that negative religious coping predicts worse psychological adjustment. 14,31 One of the only studies to examine these relationships in a prospective manner found similar results; negative religious coping was associated with more depression in medically ill patients over a two year period while positive religious coping was not. 32 It is important to note an \n0 \u00bc white, 1 \u00bc nonwhite.

ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; ns, not significant.\nexception to this pattern, however. One study of patients with breast cancer demonstrated that positive and negative religious coping were differentially related to depression. 12 Our study, however, was the only one to explore these relationships in a prospective manner, using a validated measure, while controlling for important covariates. There are several implications to our findings. For example, clinicians rarely ask patients with serious illness about their religious coping despite the fact that the majority want their physicians to be aware of their spiritual beliefs. 33,34 Because negative rather than positive religious coping predicts important health outcomes, inquiring about negative religious coping may be most beneficial. Clinicians could therefore facilitate referrals to clergy for people in the midst of religious=spiritual struggle. 35 Our findings also have implications for the development of counseling therapies. There has been increasing interest within psychology to integrate religious beliefs and practices into therapy. 36,37 A recent metaanalysis demonstrated that these interventions may be effective in improving psychological outcomes. 38 Our results indicate that targeting negative religious coping may be most important when developing counseling interventions. The focus on negative religious coping would be consistent with the literature on forgiveness interventions. 39 People may feel less angry toward God if they can be taught to believe that God did not cause the illness, if they view God's intentions as positive, or if they see some good coming from the illness. 40 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "It is important to comment on our study limitations. First, our sample consisted primarily of white, educated, middleaged, Judeo-Christian women with breast cancer. Although the percent of women who reported high levels of positive and negative religious coping in our sample was similar to that found in other clinical samples, it would nonetheless be important to replicate our results in other groups. 41,42 For example, African Americans generally are more likely to use religion to cope than are Caucasians. 43 African American women with breast cancer are also more likely to use religion as a coping strategy. 44 Also, given that the manifestations of religion can vary across groups and cultures, it would be important to study patients of other religious faiths. 45 Second, although we demonstrated that positive religious coping was not associated with well-being, our results should not imply that positive religious coping is unhelpful to patients with cancer. The fact that 76% of our sample used Cope with God ''a moderate amount'' or ''a lot'' implies that positive religious coping likely provides some benefits, for example, by stimulating personal growth which may in turn act as an important counterbalance to psychological distress. 32,46 In addition, our sample size was not sufficient to exclude the possibility that positive religious coping may have a small effect on wellbeing (i.e., we had a power of 0.60, smaller than the recommended power of 0.80, to detect an effect size of 0.4). Third, although we demonstrated that negative religious coping predicted worse psychological outcomes, the relationship may have been different had the patients been followed for a longer period. Resolving anger at God over time may be associated with better mental health and personal growth. 47,48 Finally, as with all observational studies, our data do not allow us to infer the direction of causality between negative religious coping and well-being. In addition, although several studies have demonstrated that religious coping generally has a direct association with well-being, it is possible that another, unmeasured variable (e.g., hopelessness) mediates this relationship. 49,50 In summary, religion is an important coping mechanism for women dealing with breast cancer. While used by the great majority of women in our study, positive religious coping was not associated with well-being. In contrast, negative religious coping predicted worse well-being over time, regardless of cancer stage. Clinicians should therefore be aware that women in the midst of religious=spiritual struggle are at risk for worse emotional well-being.

As discussed in the introduction to this series, research in palliative care encompasses numerous areas in which the gold standard research design, the randomized controlled trial (RCT), is not appropriate, adequate, or even possible. 1,2 The difficulties in conducting RCTs in palliative care include patient and family recruitment, gate-keeping by physicians, crossover contamination, high attrition rates, small sample sizes, and limited survival times. Furthermore, a number of important issues including variation in access to palliative care and disparities in the use and provision of palliative care simply cannot be answered without observational research methods. As research in palliative care broadens to encompass study designs other than the RCT, the collective understanding of the use, strengths, and limitations of observational research methods is critical.

Observational research involves the direct observation of individuals in their natural setting. As such, who does or does not receive an intervention is determined by individual preferences, practice patterns, or policy decisions. 3 It is therefore important for readers of observational research to consider if alternative explanations for study results exist. This issue (known as \"confounding\") is a primary challenge of observational research and will be discussed in detail in the next paper in this series.\nData for observational research is either collected by the investigator for the purpose of the study (primary data) or has already been collected for another purpose but is used by the investigator to examine a novel research question (secondary data). The primary trade-offs between using primary and secondary data relate to time, resources, and control of the collection and measurement of study variables (Table 1).\nA common source of secondary data used for observational research is administrative data. For example, data from Medicare claims allow researchers to study the health care utilization of large groups of individuals. Studies using Medicare claims data are observational because the investigator is observing the subjects' health care utilization without any contact or involvement with the subjects. It is secondary data because the data were collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for purposes other than the investigators' study.

In evaluating and critically appraising observational studies, it is important for readers to consider if the study design was appropriate for the research question and if the methodology used was consistent with the study design. A comparison of experimental and observational study designs is shown in Table 2.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Cross-sectional studies", "text": "A cross-sectional study is an observational study in which exposure and outcome are determined simultaneously for each subject. It is often described as taking a \"snapshot\" of a group of individuals. Cross-sectional studies are most ap-propriate for screening hypotheses because they require a relatively shorter time commitment and fewer resources to conduct. 5 Cross-sectional studies have been widely used in palliative care research. The cross-sectional study design has been used to understand the prevalence of various conditions, treatments, services or other outcomes and the factors associated with such outcomes. For example, we have used a cross-sectional study 7 to identify the specific services provided to patients who enrolled with hospice and the extent to which services varied across hospices. The cross-sectional study design was an efficient way to evaluate a large sample of patients receiving hospice, to understand the prevalence of specific services, and to generate hypotheses regarding why service delivery might vary across hospices. Similarly, we used a cross-sectional design to estimate the association between hospice ownership and the provision of specific types of hospice services. 8 Other examples of the use of cross-sectional designs in palliative care research include a study of the association between caregiver characteristics (e.g., sociodemographics, the existence of social networks) and caregiver burden among caregivers of terminally ill patients 9 and the association between physician characteristics (e.g., age, gender, specialty, board certification, knowledge about hospice) and referral of patients to hospice. 10 Issues that a reader should consider in evaluating a crosssectional study are threefold. First, the primary limitation of the cross-sectional study design is that because the exposure and outcome are simultaneously assessed, there is generally no evidence of a temporal relationship between exposure and outcome. That is, although the investigator may determine that there is an association between an exposure and an outcome, there is generally no evidence that the exposure caused the outcome. Of course, if the exposure is a characteristic such as gender or race and the outcome developed over time, the temporal nature of the exposure-outcome as- sociation is more plausible; however, for studies in which the exposure is not an inherent trait but one that developed over time, causality is often unclear. Second, a cross-sectional study evaluates prevalent rather than incident outcomes and thus excludes people who develop the outcome but die before the study. The measured association in a cross-sectional study is between exposure and having the outcome as opposed to exposure and developing the outcome. As such, there is a bias toward including in the study individuals with more favorable survivorship. 5 For example, early cross-sectional studies that observed beneficial effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on cardiovascular disease in older women failed to account for the increase in cardiovascularrelated mortality that, as a result of randomized studies that followed women over time, we now know occurs within the first several years of hormone replacement therapy. 11 Third, the reader needs to assess if alternative explanations for study results have been appropriately ruled out.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CARLSON AND MORRISON 78", "text": "be able to assess causality due to the temporal nature of the study design. In palliative care, cohort studies have been most useful in evaluating the effect over time of palliative care interventions. For example, a recent retrospective cohort study 12 evaluated the effect of palliative care consultation on family satisfaction with care. The authors identified a group of family members of patients who had died in the hospital and had received a palliative care consultation prior to death (the \"exposed\" group) and who had not received a palliative care consultation prior to death (the \"not exposed\" group). The investigators then contacted the families and administered a telephone survey to ascertain the family's satisfaction with care. The cohort study design enabled the researchers to conclude that hospital palliative care consultation was associated with improved family outcomes. Similarly, in a concurrent (or often called \"prospective\") cohort study, investigators studied the effect of pain and opioid analgesia on the development of delirium. 13 The study enrolled all patients presenting to the hospital with hip fracture and without delirium and followed them through their hospitalization collecting data on pain, delirium risk factors, and analgesic prescribing. The results of this study demonstrated that untreated pain was a significant risk factor for the development of delirium and that opioid analgesics decreased the risk of developing this condition.\nCohort study designs are increasingly used in palliative care research in what are known as \"quasi-experimental\" studies. These cohort studies combine elements of observational and experimental research methods. Quasi-experimental designs are similar to experimental designs in that there is a specific investigator-defined intervention for the \"exposed\" group in the study, but individuals are not randomized to receive the intervention. Individuals are simply observed as having or not having the intervention (or exposure) and outcomes are subsequently assessed. For example, to study the effect of bereavement counseling on caregiver outcomes, an investigator could design a specific bereavement counseling intervention and offer it to each family that receives a palliative care consult at a specific hospital. Some families will choose the intervention and some will not. The investigator then compares outcomes for the families that received and did not receive the bereavement counseling intervention. The aforementioned study is considered quasiexperimental because it involves a specific intervention designed and implemented as part of the study (experimental) but subjects are not randomized to the intervention; rather their receipt or nonreceipt of the intervention is ob-", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "STUDY DESIGN, PRECISION, VALIDITY IN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES 79", "text": "Issues to Consider: Cross-Sectional Study 1) If causality is asserted, is it appropriate?\n2) Is the distinction between prevalent and incident cases a factor? 3) Have alternative explanations been ruled out?", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Cohort studies", "text": "The identifying feature of a cohort study design is that the subjects are followed over time. Cohort studies begin with individuals who are exposed and not exposed to a factor and then evaluate the subsequent development of an outcome. Cohort studies may be concurrent or retrospective, the distinction being when, relative to the current time, the subjects are identified (Fig. 1). Cohort studies are an appropriate study design when: (1) there is good evidence to suggest an association between an exposure and an outcome (perhaps through prior cross-sectional studies); (2) the interval between exposure and development of the outcome is relatively short to minimize loss to follow-up; and (3) the outcome is not too rare (so that the size of the cohort is reasonable). The advantages of the cohort study design are that because the investigator identifies new or \"incident\" cases of the outcome, one can look at disease progression, staging, and natural history. Cohort designs can yield incidence rates as well as relative risks, and cohort studies may FIG. 1. Cohort study design.\nserved by the investigator. Quasi-experimental study designs are increasingly used in palliative care research to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical or educational interventions.\nThere are a number of important issues to consider in evaluating an observational cohort study in palliative care. One issue is loss to follow-up, particularly differential loss to follow-up. Loss to follow-up occurs when, during the study period, individuals drop out of the study. Differential loss to follow-up is when the drop-out rate differs in the exposed and not exposed groups. The concern is that differential loss to follow-up introduces bias into the study. Readers should look for a statement regarding loss to follow-up and whether or not it differed between the study groups. Second, as in cross-sectional studies, the existence of alternative explanations for study results due to confounding must be carefully considered. Third, readers need to assess if there is potential bias in outcome assessment. Given the team-oriented approach to palliative care, it is often difficult to blind (i.e., keep the exposure status of the study participant unknown) the investigators who are assessing the study outcome. Knowing the exposure status of the study participant may influence or bias the assessment of the outcome. exposures because they have already considered the potential causes of their disease. Similarly, interviewer bias occurs when study investigators interview cases more thoroughly regarding past exposures than controls because they know the subject is a case. Readers of case-control studies should consider the potential extent of recall or interviewer bias and whether study investigators attempted to mitigate these issues.\nSample selection in a case-control study is complex. Cases may be selected from a variety of sources including hospital patients, patients in a physician's practice, clinic patients, and cancer registries. It is desirable to select cases from multiple institutions (e.g., multiple hospitals in the community instead of one hospital) to obtain more generalizable results. Criteria for case eligibility should be carefully specified in the Methods section. It is preferable to use incident (\"newly diagnosed\") cases so that risk factors identified are not related to survival with the outcome as opposed to development of the outcome.\nThe most important issue to consider in critically evaluating a case-control study is the process by which controls were selected and the resulting comparability of cases and controls. The selection of controls is the most complex and controversial aspect of conducting a case-control study. Controls should be similar to cases in all respects other than having the disease or should be similar to the general population from which the cases arose. Common sources of controls include the spouse, friend, or neighbor of the case, an individual hospitalized at the same time as the case but for a different reason, or an individual chosen randomly from the general population. Controls chosen from the general population used to be often ascertained from random digit dialing. However, the increased use of answering machines, \"Do Not Call\" lists, and cell phones has rendered random digit dialing a less effective option as individuals reached by land-line phone may no longer be representative of the general population. Some case-control studies use matching, which refers to selecting controls so that they are similar to cases in specific characteristics (e.g., race, age, gender, socioeconomic status). Cases that are unable to be matched are often excluded from the analyses. Readers should determine the proportion of cases that were excluded from the analyses because a high proportion could limit the generalizability of the study.\nTo date, case-control studies have not been widely used in palliative care research. This is not surprising as the primary benefit of the case-control design is the ability to", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "CARLSON AND MORRISON 80", "text": "Issues to Consider: Cohort Study 1) Was there significant loss to follow-up? 2) Was loss to follow-up differential? 3) Was there potential bias in outcome assessment? 4) Have alternative explanations been ruled out?", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Case-control studies", "text": "Case-control studies begin with individuals who have the outcome (\"cases\") and compare them to individuals who do not have the outcome (\"controls\") according to past history of exposure to a factor (Fig. 2). Case-control studies are appropriate when: (1) the outcome is rare and (2) there is reliable evidence of past exposure. One issue to consider in ascertaining past exposure is recall bias. Past exposure is generally ascertained by interviewing subjects or analyzing historical records or charts. If cases and controls differentially recall past exposures or there is more or less thorough documentation on cases compared to controls, study results may be biased. For case-control studies, the general concern is that cases will be more likely than controls to recall past FIG. 2. Case-control study design. study rare outcomes (e.g., rare diseases) and to look back in time for exposures that may be correlated with the outcome. At this point, palliative care research is generally not focused on studying rare outcomes and thus the benefit of the case-control design is more limited. However, one area of geriatrics research that has used the case-control study design is the understanding of factors associated with hospital falls. An initial understanding of risk factors for falling in the hospital came from a case-control study conducted in a large urban academic hospital. 14 The investigators identified 98 patients who fell while they were inpatients (cases) and compared them to 318 inpatients who did not fall (controls). They then interviewed each patient in the study to assess potential patient-related, medicationrelated, and care-related risk factors. The case-control study design was ideal in that it allowed the investigators to study a fairly rare outcome and yet obtain a relatively large sample size.\nestimates. In evaluating estimates from observational studies, it is generally helpful to consider the standard deviations of estimates and the width of confidence intervals. A large standard deviation relative to the estimate indicates low precision. Similarly, wide confidence intervals for estimates of association (e.g., odds ratios or relative risks) indicate low precision.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Evaluating the Validity of an Observational Study", "text": "A second general challenge of observational research is validity. Whereas precision is a lack of random error, validity refers to a lack of systematic error. 5 Observational studies are evaluated in terms of both internal and external validity. Internal validity refers to the strength of the inferences from the study. That is, did the \"exposure\" or \"intervention\" cause a difference in the outcome (high internal validity) or was a difference in the outcome caused by systematic error in the study (low internal validity). The key question in assessing internal validity is whether observed changes can be attributed to the exposure and not to other possible causes. The internal validity of a study may be compromised by not having a control group or by having a control group that is not comparable to the exposed group in measurable or unmeasurable ways.\nExternal validity is the ability to generalize study results to a more universal population. 5 Inferences about cause-effect associations from a specific study are considered externally valid if they may be generalized from the unique and idiosyncratic settings, procedures and participants of the study, to other populations and conditions. External validity is the degree to which the conclusions in a study would hold for other persons in other places and at other times. As such, internal validity is a prerequisite for external validity. That is, the study must demonstrate that the \"exposure\" in the study is the cause of variation in the outcome before one can generalize that the exposure more universally causes the outcome.\nOne indication that a study lacks external validity is if the sample is not representative. The most common loss of external validity in observational research comes from the fact that studies often employ small samples obtained from a single geographic location or facility. Because of this, one cannot be sure that the conclusions drawn about cause-effectrelationships apply to people in other geographic locations or at other facilities.

The first challenge is precision. Precision refers to lack of random error or random variation in a study's estimates. 5 In observational studies, random variation arises from the subjects in the study, the way in which subjects are sampled, and the way in which variables are measured. Subjects in a study are always considered a sample of possible individuals who could have been included in the study but were not and thus the sample selection introduces random variation. The measurement of key variables also introduces random variation. Because most observational studies must include potential confounding variables, random variation due to the measurement of these variables will likely exist (this is compared with an RCT in which the randomization may eliminate the need to include potential confounding variables).\nAs a reader of an observational study, one can get a sense of the precision by considering both the sample size and the efficiency of the study. In general, a larger study and one with more balanced groups (i.e., exposed, not exposed, with outcome, without outcome) will produce more precise estimates. 5 For example, a study with a large sample size (n \u03ed 1000) but only a small number of subjects who are exposed (n \u03ed 50) compared with not exposed (n \u03ed 950) will yield less precise estimates than a smaller sample size where roughly half of participants are exposed and not exposed. Similarly, the proportion of subjects with the outcome and the distribution of subjects across key covariates will impact the efficiency and thus precision of the study Questions a Critical Reader Should Ask 1) Is the study design appropriate for the research question? 2) Is the sample size adequate and evenly distributed across groups and covariates? 3) Are the groups comparable aside from exposure status? 4) Do estimates appear precise? 5) Is causality appropriately attributed? 6) Is there potential bias due to differential loss to follow up? 7) Is there potential recall or interviewer bias? 8) Have alternative explanations been considered and ruled out? 9) Are results placed in the context of existing literature and inconsistencies explained? 10) Is there external validity?", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "User's guide to research in palliative care: Why is a new series needed?", "journal": "J Palliat Med", "year": "2008", "authors": "M D Carlson; R S Morrison"}, {"title": "Why we need observational studies to evaluate the effectiveness of health care", "journal": "BMJ", "year": "1996", "authors": "N Black"}, {"title": "Reader's guide to critical appraisal of cohort studies: 2.

Despite the rapid growth and impact of hospital palliative care programs in the last few years, a major gap in access to palliative care persists. That gap is in nonhospice palliative care services in the community setting. In an effort to meet the needs of the millions of patients living in the community who are not yet eligible for hospice care, the outpatient palliative care program has emerged as a key link in the chain of continuity of palliative care.\nLeaders of hospital palliative care programs have also recognized problems of continuity and care transitions for seriously ill patients entering and leaving the hospital, and have begun to experiment with new models of transitional care delivered outside the hospital. Inpatient palliative care advocates recognize the frustrations of carefully planning for their patients' posthospital needs and then seeing those plans evaporate after the patient leaves the protective environment of the hospital's palliative care program. 1 The outpatient (clinic-or office-based) service offers specialist-level palliative care services either as a brief consultation or as a concurrent care model, in collaboration with the patient's primary treating physician. These programs also provide immediate postdischarge follow-up, continuity of care for plans developed in the hospital, medication reconciliation, and responsiveness to patients' and family members' questions and concerns after they have returned home from the hospital.\nOutpatient palliative care programs, by identifying and addressing problems before they evolve into crises, can also help to reduce the risk of unnecessary rehospitalizations, and shorten those hospital stays that do occur. Potential benefits, including avoiding such rehospitalizations, emergency department visits, and the \"frequent flyer\" phenomenon in seriously ill patients, may persuade health systems to support an outpatient presence for palliative care providers, especially if advocates are able to demonstrate its benefits. (See Tables 1 and 2 for a summary of the benefits and challenges of outpatient palliative care.)\nInadequate reimbursement, limited space, and insufficient staffing have posed challenges to the growth of outpatient palliative care programs. Hospital palliative care leaders have developed creative approaches to exploiting the available physical plant and staff schedules. Often, however, these services are launched on a shoestring, perhaps only a half-day per week, while drawing upon larger outpatient clinics' ancillary staff and facilities.\nThe medical literature highlights positive outcomes from outpatient palliative care around the world, but little has been published addressing operational issues faced by U.S. palliative care programs. [2][3][4][5] One exception is the Comprehensive Care Team, 6 developed in a general medicine outpatient clinic at the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center with a grant from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care, a for patients with advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer.\n\"With the Comprehensive Care Team, we asked clinicians to consider referring patients with a prognosis of between 2 and 5 years to live. Despite that emphasis, we had a significant 1-year mortality rate, ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Notes from the Field", "text": "Feature Editor: Diane E. Meier suggesting we often have less time that we might think,\" reports principal investigator Michael Rabow, M.D., palliative care physician at UCSF. The project was able to demonstrate positive results in a number of outcomes, but as a consultation service it was not able to achieve the desired influence on primary care physicians' behavior in prescribing appropriate medications to treat pain and depression.\nThat project ended when the grant did. Subsequently, Rabow and colleagues developed a comanagement model of outpatient palliative care and found a home in UCSF's Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a new project called the Symptom Management Service. \"We called it Symptom Management because that would be more acceptable than palliative care in a cancer center.\" After 2 years of piloting, the service was formally launched in July 2007, with referrals from all departments of the cancer center and from physicians whose patients needed extra support. Interventions have focused largely on pain, anxiety, and depression, as well as support for family caregivers. \"We primarily see patients who are engaged with and committed to their chemotherapy, and we are committed to supporting that goal as a key component of our intervention,\" Rabow says. \"Once physicians realized we were doing comanagement, trying to work alongside active oncologic treatments, the service grew quickly.\"\nThree palliative care physicians provide coverage during 4 half-day sessions per week in two different locations in the cancer center and medical center, drawing upon the cancer center's nurses, nurse practitioners, and social workers to round out the team, with pharmacy and chaplaincy services from the hospital. \"Patients come to us for scheduled visits, but usually without a long wait time. We also provide support by telephone,\" Rabow says.\nThe biggest challenge facing the program is financial, he adds. \"We bill for our services, but clearly, billing revenues are never going to cover our costs.\" The program is supported by grants and philanthropy. In its first 6 months, the service made a total of 324 in-person visits (129 initial contacts and 195 followups), plus 114 phone consultations. \u2022 Staffing-having sufficient, available staff to provide predictable clinic coverage and responsiveness to patient needs 24-7. \u2022 Space-lining up examination rooms and other facilities in a setting where space is often at a premium. \u2022 Logistical support-the need for scheduling, receptionist coverage, waiting area, and all the other components of a well-run outpatient clinic. \u2022 Unpredictable demand for clinic slots and services.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "MEIER AND BERESFORD 824", "text": "\u2022 Financial-outpatient palliative care services are unlikely to be able to cover their costs from visit billing revenues alone. \u2022 Identity questions-should the service become a chronic pain service, a comprehensive geriatric provider, or a chronic disease management care service? \u2022 Communication infrastructure-with primary care physicians, hospital staff, and other community providers-along with the need to bridge sometimes incompatible information systems, charting, and billing. \u2022 Communicating the role and value for palliative care in the outpatient setting to patients, referral sources, and health system administrators.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "THE PRIMARY CARE MODEL", "text": "In contrast to outpatient palliative care services that are developed as extensions or supplements to inpatient consultation services, drawing upon the inpatient service to identify and refer patients, UCSF's Symptom Management Service is an outpatient-based continuity or consulting service, Rabow says. It draws largely on clinic physicians in UCSF's outpatient cancer center for referrals of patients with cancer or other serious, chronic illnesses.\nGiven the typical acuity and advanced stage of illness seen in the hospital patient, an outpatient service drawing its referrals from hospital discharges would tend to meet patients late in the course of their illness. In contrast, an outpatient palliative care model drawing referrals directly from other practitioners in the community is able to identify and serve patients much earlier in the course of their illness, preferably from the point of diagnosis, Rabow says. \"Our model of palliative care is accessed as pure palliative care-focused on symptom management and quality of life without regard to limited life expectancy. It is the simultaneous care model of palliative care, with the goal of moving palliative care upstream and keeping it there. Many patients get a new diagnosis of cancer and a simultaneous referral to our service,\" he explains.\n\"Clearly, there are patients referred to our service preparatory to a hospice referral, while they are still getting their fifth-line cancer treatment. But many oncologists have become comfortable referring patients to us for more routine bumps in the road-for stress and anxiety around a new diagnosis, pain and other physical and psychological symptoms, management of treatment side effects, or newly discovered metastases.\"\nThe service increasingly is involved in advance care planning and patient decision-making conversations. \"But in the primary outpatient palliative care model, patients are more likely to get referred for symptoms rather than goal clarification, and these discussions arise only after we have seen them for a while and developed trust,\" Rabow says. \"We are able to take the time necessary to establish relationships and to find a deeper understanding of what they know about their disease-a more nuanced understanding of their hopes and goals.\"", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "OTHER OUTPATIENT MODELS", "text": "The palliative care service at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, estab-lished in 2001, also grew out of a Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care grant to Dartmouth's Project ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise Before Life Ends). Project ENABLE was designed to introduce palliative care services at the time of diagnosis to rural outpatients with lung, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers. Advanced practice nurses provided educational programs on how to navigate living with cancer and followed patients and families across care settings, including bereavement.\nIn a sense, the current inpatient palliative care consultation service at Dartmouth grew out of the outpatient service, says palliative care nurse practitioner Margaret Bishop. Today, Dartmouth's palliative care program includes 2.8 physician FTEs and 3.3 advanced practice nurse FTEs, as well as a clinical social worker, pastoral care coordinator, volunteer coordinator and volunteers, administrative staff, and a clinical director overseeing all aspects of the program-inpatient, outpatient, and outreach to community agencies in the two-state area.\nInpatient palliative care, given the acuity of patients in the hospital, is inherently more dramatic than outpatient, but the program at Dartmouth has experimented with a variety of policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that both services get equal attention and support, Bishop says. Inpatient and outpatient staff come together every morning in meetings of varied length and format, with structured opportunities for discussing outpatient cases. At one time, palliative care nurse practitioners rotated between the inpatient and outpatient services, but more recently two nurses, Bishop and Paula Caron, were assigned permanently to the outpatient setting. They believe this has enhanced continuity of care.\nThe palliative care clinic is based in a cancer clinic located inside the hospital building. The service is offered from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, drawing upon cancer clinic staff and nurses' aides, who take patients' vital signs and escort them to the examination room. Initial visits are scheduled for 90 minutes, usually conducted jointly by the nurse practitioner and social worker. The palliative care chaplain and team physicians are called upon as needed, and the team is willing to travel to other clinic settings within the medical center in order to see patients where they are.\nThe service grew from 283 outpatient visits in 2001 to 1233 in 2007. Half of these come from hematology-oncology, with a wide variety of other diseases represented. Although referrals come from physicians, nurses, patients, and families, a screening and referral algorithm specifies automatic palliative care consultations for clinic patients with stage IIIB and IV lung OUTPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE 825 cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme. \"The algorithm has been very important in helping us establish ourselves,\" Bishop says, but just being present in the clinic environment and modeling palliative care for clinic staff have also been important to its growth. The palliative care service at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has added components of \"clinic-based palliative, supportive, and psychological services\" to a comprehensive, multisite inpatient service that includes 10 physicians and fellows, among other team members. UAB's outpatient components, developed strategically or in response to system requests, include:\n\u2022 The supportive care clinic, targeting symptom management, psychological needs and goals-of-care determinations, primarily for patients with cancer, many of whom are in active treatment; \u2022 The palliative care clinic, for patients with advanced, life-threatening illnesses such as end-stage heart, lung, liver, or neurologic diseases; \u2022 The cachexia clinic, in collaboration with an otolaryngology clinic, to give a targeted palliative focus to symptoms of weight loss and wasting; and \u2022 The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) palliative care clinic, offering palliative care for patients living with HIV, housed in an HIV community health clinic several blocks from the hospital.\nTypically, these clinics are each offered a half-day per week and housed in established clinic settings. \"Our emphasis for the outpatient program has been to develop efficient and effective processes of care to support patients through transitions in goals and settings of care,\" says UAB palliative care physician Elizabeth Kvale, M.D., who directs the outpatient palliative care program. A nurse coordinator helps to staff the clinic, coordinate transitions and communications, and make sure that palliative care inpatients go home with an appointment card and a reconciled medication list. The outpatient team also includes a nutritionist, social worker, and psychologist.\nAll of these outpatient services are subjected to continuous quality improvement, using a battery of outcomes measures. The outpatient clinic program also cares for a significant number of cancer survivors, Kvale says, since the cancer center does not offer a formal survivorship program. Many cancer survivors face lasting morbidities and symptoms associated with past cancer treatments. The service is subsidized by the UAB health system. \"There is a cost-avoidance argument to be made for outpatient palliative care and we are making it,\" Kvale notes. \"There are all sorts of pressures on the health system, and we are in a position to assist our oncology colleagues with time-intensive outpatient management of their complex patients.\"\nAt the Fairview Health System in Minneapolis, Minnesota, outpatient services were established about 3 years after the inpatient consultation service was launched. \"We were faced with the need to follow patients going home and to provide access to palliative care experts outside of the hospital, especially for those with complicated clinical situations such as a newly established methadone regimen,\" says Lyn Ceronsky, Fairview's director of palliative care. \"Referring physicians were asking us: 'Would you be able to see my patient outpatient?'\"\nThe outpatient service deliberately started small and grew slowly. It is offered one day a week, with two palliative care physicians alternating. \"If the physicians can't be there, I'll staff the clinic as a nurse practitioner,\" Ceronsky says. A licensed clinical social worker able to bill for psychological counseling is also present, and a chaplain is available on call. Initial, 60minute outpatient visits involve both the physician and social worker.\n\"We share space with the outpatient pain clinic, which operates 5 days per week. We're like a roommate; we're lucky to be able to use their infrastructure, scheduling, coding, billing, nurse triage, and the like without having to pay for those ancillaries. They had the space and capacity and it just seemed to make sense,\" she says. Despite this support, Ceronsky thinks it will be hard for the outpatient palliative care service to ever break even on billing.\nFairview's palliative care program has also been working with two primary care clinics to educate physicians about the role of outpatient palliative care, providing them with a script for how to introduce the concept to patients (see Table 3 for text of the prepared script). \"We have worked elbow-to-elbow with staff in the hospital. But primary care providers out in the community haven't had that experience,\" she says.\nA few other examples illustrate the variety of responses to local demand for outpatient palliative care services:\n\u2022 Cook County Hospital's palliative care service in Chicago, Illinois, developed an outpatient clinic one half-day per week in response to requests from the inpatient team and other clinicians in the large public hospital, says Catherine Deamant, M.D., director of palliative care. The clinic, staffed by a palliative care attending and fellow, sees patients with cancer MEIER AND BERESFORD 826 disproportionately, and is looking for opportunities to expand to noncancer diseases and add a second half-day per week. A palliative care physician also regularly attends the Huntington's disease clinic, and the team is available to respond in real time to requests for consultations from other outpatient clinics. \"The hospital has valued palliative care's pres-ence, and our interest in the outpatient setting has been very well received,\" Deamant says, even though the hospital billing system has struggled with capturing billing revenues for outpatient palliative care-in a patient population that is roughly 40% uninsured.

This clinic is closely coordinated with the joint inpatient services and provides a home and office space for both outpatient and inpatient palliative care staff.\n\"If you don't have a clinic of your own-which can be costly-you can still see patients for office visits in borrowed or shared facilities,\" Swinford says. \"Most hospitals have some kind of outpatient service that palliative care could connect with.

Despite this crucial role, expertise in the art and science of prognostication diminished during the twentieth century, due largely to the ascendancy of accurate diagnostic tests and effective therapies. Consequently, \"Doctor, how long do I have?\" is a question most physicians find unprepared to answer effectively. As we focus on palliative care in the twentyfirst century, prognostication will need to be restored as a core clinical proficiency. The discipline of palliative medicine can provide leadership in this direction. This paper begins by discussing a framework for understanding prognosis and how its different domains might be applied to all patients with life limiting illness, although the main focus of the paper is predicting survival in patients with cancer. Examples of prognostic tools are provided, although the subjective assessment of prognosis remains important in the terminally ill.

It stands, along with diagnosis and therapeutics, as a way of demonstrating knowledge and mastery of a disease. Being able to identify a disease or illness and subsequently treat and cure the patient have become hallmarks of medicine in the last century as our technology and knowledge have advanced. With this increased ability to alter a course of disease, our profession has not kept pace with advancements in predicting the likely outcomes, especially when the outcomes are life or death. A PubMed search (July 2007) for the terms \"diagnosis,\" \"therapy,\" or \"prognosis\" demonstrates a biased re-search agenda: 5.6 million articles for diagnosis, 4.9 million articles for therapy, and 0.6 million for prognosis. Formal medical education opportunities focusing on prognostication are scarce, yet being asked \"Doctor, how long do I have?\" is one of the most important and most intimidating questions asked of our profession. 1 All physicians call on forecasting skills in all aspects of medicine to select treatments, prioritize diagnoses, and educate patients and families. For example, the statement, \"You have pneumonia, and you will start antibiotics and should be feeling better in a couple of days,\" involves aspects of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic skills. Yet with the prior statement, physicians are unlikely to identify use of prognostica-tion. Although prognostication can involve more than life or death, predictions of life expectancy are what most physicians consider when they hear the words \"prognosis\" and \"prognostication.\"\nMany patients and families want information about life expectancy, 2 so palliative care physicians need to be prepared to respond to this request. One of the key roles for palliative care services is to initiate discussions on prognosis and goals of care, 3 which have often been neglected prior to the consultation. 4 An audit of 325 consecutive referrals to a palliative care service in an American academic teaching hospital indicated discussions on prognosis and goals of care was the most common function performed by the service, occurring in almost 95% of cases. 5 A prognosis is a prediction of possible future outcomes of a treatment or a disease course based on medical knowledge and experience. 6 Because of the uncertainty of the future, and the complex dynamic system of the human body, prognostication can seem mysterious, unknowable and powerful. Through applying scientific method, medicine has and can make advancements in predicting medical outcomes, despite the formidable task. A century ago, it would have been thought impossible to predict the landfall of hurricanes or the approach of a blizzard, but meteorology has begun to understand and predict the near-future outcomes of the complex dynamic system of Earth's climate.\nTo address various issues requiring physicians to utilize prognostic skills, Fries and Ehrlich define the \"the 5D's of prognostication\" 7 :\n1. Disease progression/recurrence 2. Death 3. Disability/discomfort 4. Drug toxicity 5. Dollars (costs of health care) Using this framework, examples of some typical day-to-day prognostic questions for palliative care physicians are shown in Table 1. Doctors prognosticate whenever a medical treatment decision is made, but how explicitly the prognosis is discussed with others is variable. In trying to determine if a septic patient will survive a trip from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the computed tomography (CT) scanner, a physician may make the decision independently or collaborate with other clinicians or the family. In discussing hospice referral, a physician may discuss appropriateness directly with the patient and family based on an explicit prognosis of a few months. A prognosis can also be inferred by the patient or family when not openly discussed, such as noticing less lab draws or less consultants rounding in the context of a rapid decline.\nThere are two components to the act of prognostication: formulation (or \"foreseeing\"), the physician's cognitive or objective estimate of the future course of the patient's illness, and communication (or \"foretelling\"), the physician's discussion of the prediction with others. This paper focuses on the impact and formulation of prognosis in patients with advanced cancer. Formulating prognosis in patients with other lifelimiting illnesses is covered elsewhere in this series. There are many articles on \"how to break bad news\" that often includes the archetype of communicating an unfavorable prognosis, so this will not be reviewed in detail here. [8][9][10][11] Despite the neglect of prognostic formulation in modern health care, there are some helpful tools and key points necessary for effective palliative care.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IMPACT OF PROGNOSTICATION ON PATIENT AND FAMILY AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS", "text": "An openly discussed prognosis has the potential to greatly alter the treatment plan for a patient.

Other findings from SUPPORT included patients being less likely to desire cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the patient felt the prognoses to be \"poor.\" 13 Murphy et al. 14 demonstrated that knowledge of CPR outcomes greatly decreased the likelihood of choosing CPR during an acute illness. After watching a video on depicting living with advanced dementia, patients without dementia were more likely to choose comfort care over life-prolonging treatments. 15 Clarification of prognosis is vital to ensure patients make decisions based on likely outcomes as opposed to merely hopeful results. Multiple palliative care teams can attest to patients being optimistic in regards to prognosis in light of metastatic disease, or incurable treatment options. This optimism of prognostication as perceived by patients may lead to the requesting of medical technologies and treatments that would not be chosen if a more accurate and realistic prognosis was formulated and clearly communicated.\nPalliative care teams frequently are able to realign goals of care based on prognostic information. Prognostication can impact the decisions that patients and families make about time shared together, estate management, funeral planning, and other practical issues. Prognosis is also important for families in determining how to respond to the patient's palliative care needs, such as deciding how to care for the patient at home to urgently summoning a relative from out of town to visit a dying loved one. Parents of children with cancer who realize there is no hope of cure are also more likely to choose palliative care. 16 Families' dissatisfaction with communication around prognosis and other end of life issues has been well documented in studies such as SUPPORT. 17 Interviews with family members of the recently deceased reveal the competing types of information families request, particularly when the patient is near death 18 :\n\u2022 An internal tension between wanting realistic prognostic information and still allowing room for hope. \u2022 Family ambivalence about how much information the family can cope with and understand. \u2022 Family members want different sorts of information for themselves versus the patient. \u2022 Families need guidance interpreting what physicians communicate. \u2022 Families need assistance understanding the aims of treatment given the prognosis. \u2022 Families feel overwhelmed and poorly prepared to make choices on behalf of the patient.\nThe palliative care physician needs to be aware of these concerns when discussing prognosis and other end of life issues with families. Reviewing prognostic information repeatedly on multiple occasions is likely to be necessary to ensure adequate understanding by families.\nDischarge planning is a crucial function of palliative care consult services, [3][4][5] with discharge plans being established for a majority of referrals. 4,5 Predicting the outcome is one of many complex functions to be considered when developing a discharge plan in terminally ill patients, and often goes beyond \"time-todeath\" to include the other dimensions of prognosis. The typical palliative care consult, where decisions/ goals are usually central will involve predicting:\n\u2022 The time frame of death; \u2022 The impact of disease modifying therapies, including toxicities; and \u2022 The future disease course (including symptoms, function, family impact, and financial issues).\nThe palliative care physician needs to integrate these prognostic data points into a cohesive whole and then match this information with the various options for providing the care (home, nursing home, hospice facility, hospital) and the patient and family's goals, priorities and expectations. Will the patient become weaker or stronger? More or less mobile? Will the patient develop problems many families may have difficulty with (e.g., bleeding, incontinence, seizures, confusion)? Predicting these outcomes can be as difficult as predicting death.\nThe underutilization of hospice services in the United States is well documented, with only approximately one third of deaths occurring in hospice and the typical time of referral being closer to 1 month than the eligible 6 months. 19 Many studies have been undertaken to try to understand the barriers to hospice GLARE AND SINCLAIR 86 referral and these have been identified at all levels: patient and family, health care provider, health care system.\nWhether physicians' difficulty with formulating a prognosis of less than 6 months is a major barrier is uncertain. One survey of health maintenance organization (HMO) physicians in northern California identified difficulty prognosticating as the principal barrier to hospice referral. 20 However, studies demonstrate physicians' ability to accurately distinguish patients with cancer with a prognosis of less than 3 months 21 or less than 6 months. 12 The problem of prognosis and hospice referral is more likely related to physicians' attitudes about how and when to communicate a poor prognosis and initiate hospice discussions rather than to poor prognostic skills. 22 Palliative care has been referred to as hospice care within the hospital setting and independent of expected survival. 23 In a prognostic study of palliative care referrals in an Australian teaching hospital, the median survival was only 1 month. 24 British data also indicate palliative care teams are underutilized in general hospital wards, where up to 25% of patients may be deemed \"palliative.\" 25 A better medical understanding of prognosis may help identify patients who are eligible for palliative care services.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "PHYSICIAN WILLINGNESS TO PROGNOSTICATE AND RELATED BARRIERS", "text": "There have been few surveys undertaken of palliative care physicians' views on prognosis, 26 although it is well recognized that hospital palliative care teams can play a major role in improving patient insight, including knowledge about their prognosis. 27 A survey of close to 700 American generalists and specialists in the late 1990s provided a foundation for understanding physicians' attitudes to prognostication. 28 Although prognostication was a frequent act (performed 100 times per year by the \"typical\" oncologist), nearly 60 % of physicians surveyed felt poorly trained in the task of prognostication. Clinicians reported difficulty in formulating and communicating a prognosis. Reasons for the stressfulness of prognostication identified in the survey included feelings that patients want too much certainty and accuracy from the prediction. In addition to the perception of a high standard, the study demonstrated physicians were intimidated by being judged by patients and other clinicians if the prognosis was wrong-although not as badly as for getting the diagnosis wrong. Physicians were found to avoid prognosticating, generally waiting to be asked rather than volunteering a prediction. Doctors described more reluctance to prognosticate when the clinical situation was atypical and the course seemed more uncertain than usual.\nWhen prognosticating, almost all physicians surveyed said they would be optimistic. Moreover, two thirds also admitted if the patient were optimistic about the prognosis then the physician would generally reinforce an optimistic view. Finally, almost all the surveyed physicians said they would try to avoid being specific when giving a prediction. These attitudes and behaviors have been described as the \"professional norms\" of prognosis, 29 and are summarized in Table 2. Because clarifying the prognosis is one of the key functions of hospital palliative care teams, education and training of palliative care physicians needs to focus on overcoming these tendencies of avoidance and deception in the effort to provide a false hope.\nThe sociologic study of medical culture and the barriers to prognostication is incomplete, but key issues are beginning to emerge. The centrality of diagnostics and therapeutics in medical practice may divert most physicians' interest in, and attention to, prognosis. 29 The conditional nature of a formulated prognosis means, unlike the diagnosis, it needs to be reformulated at regular intervals. This dynamic nature of prognosis can help balance the inherent uncertainty, but if physicians are already reluctant to prognosticate one time, it may be difficult to convince many to prognosticate on more frequent basis. The lack of formal educational opportunities about prognosis in medical schools, journals, and textbooks also contributes to lack of self-confidence. 8,30 Physicians believe in a prognostic self-fulfilling prophecy, and this understandably makes them less willing to formulate, let alone communicate, unfavorable prognoses. 29 Oncology is beginning to identify the common conflict between giving an unfavorable prognosis and maintaining hope in patients with advanced cancer. 31 While most patients can be redirected toward hoping in more realistic outcomes, such as a PALLIATIVE MEDICINE REVIEW: PROGNOSTICATION 87 death with well-controlled symptoms or refocusing on the person as an \"individual\" and not as a patient, some patients will not accept this. Clinical inertia allows an oncologist to accede to the patients' wishes and offer more treatment. 32 Prognosis can be perceived as more emotional than diagnosis and therapy, especially when associated with death, thereby further repelling physicians from approaching the topic. The pressures of modern clinical practice impact open prognostication. As it has been said \"it almost always takes less time to explain the side effects and schedule of a new treatment than it does to discuss death and dying.\" 31 The disclosure of prognosis to terminally ill patients may be impeded by medico-legal issues. Given greater demands for patient involvement in medical decisionmaking, the disclosure of terminal prognosis is being seen as ethically justified because it upholds the principle of self-determination and enables patients to make treatment decisions consistent with their life goals. 33 Prognostication is also the foundation for any discussion regarding medical futility and therefore may be called into question in an ethics committee or a court of law.\nIn view of the \"norms of prognostication,\" discussions about prognosis at the end of life often do not take place, and when they do, they are limited in scope. A study of the medical record of 232 randomly selected hospitalized patients in Connecticut with inoperable cancer examined the presence and content of discussions about prognosis and advanced care planning efforts. 34 Discussions about prognosis were documented in the medical records of only 89 (38%) patients. Physicians and patients were both present during the discussion in 46 (52%) of these cases. Time until expected death was infrequently documented. At most, a physician may write a prognosis as \"guarded,\" \"poor,\" or \"terminal,\" as if the profession had mutually agreed upon objective definitions. These terms are quite subjective and unfortunately appear in research on prognostication as well, hampering efforts to accurately translate research from the journal to the bedside.\nEven when prognosis is discussed, concerns remain about the openness of such discussions. 35,36 Increasing evidence demonstrates doctors may be shifting from withholding to revealing a terminal prognosis in advanced industrial societies. However this revealing of a prognosis may use \"partial and conditional\" rather than \"full and open\" disclosure. 35 A collusion in physician-patient communication about imminent death may result in a \"false optimism about recovery.\" 36 This collusion is a result of physicians' activism and pa-tients' adherence to the treatment calendar and the \"recovery plot,\" which allows both to avoid acknowledging explicitly what should and could be known. The physician may desire and refuse to communicate a poor prognosis, while the patient may desire and refuse to hear it, but neither is willing to take the first step. Patients gradually discover or realize the poor prognosis by various means, from witnessing their physical deterioration to contact with others who may be dying to reading the actions of others around them. Solving the problem of collusion between physician and patient requires an active, patient-oriented approach by the physician. Perhaps solutions can be found outside the physician-patient relationship itself, for example, involving \"treatment brokers\" for which palliative care physicians may possibly play a role. 37 ", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "DETERMINING PROGNOSIS IN ADVANCED AND TERMINAL CANCER", "text": "The approach to formulating an individual prognosis can be divided into two main methods. The clinician's prediction of survival (CPS) depends on one's clinical experience and knowledge to make a subjective judgment about an individual's prognosis. The second method is actuarial estimation of survival (AES), which uses factors established through data and research to more narrowly define an individual prognosis for a patient. 38 AES typically involves indexes or scores which are then compared to a table defining various mortality data points. AES and CPS are not mutually exclusive, as a clinician may use a prognostic score or index as a starting point and refine the prognosis to the clinical scenario. Also, some prognostic indices use the CPS as part of the scoring system in addition to objective data.\nThe approach for both AES and CPS rely on many of the factors illustrated in Figure 1, adapted from MacKillop and colleagues. Many different data points may be called upon in AES and CPS depending on the clinical situation. Increasingly, tumor markers are identified as helpful determinants at time of diagnosis to help select therapy and predict possible response/outcome before clinical signs may suggest a prognosis. For prognostication closer to the time of death, functional status and simple prognostic indices are a growing area of research for application in the palliative care population (see Appendix A).\nA common clinical roadblock to assisting patients and families with realistic prognostication is relying on statistics to communicate a general prognosis. Population-based median survivals (e.g., 6 months for", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "GLARE AND SINCLAIR 88", "text": "stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer) are available for many cancers. While this general prognosis guides the clinician on the outlook for the cancer and the impact of their treatments it may not be relevant to the individual and is not easilyy communicated. Also, median survival data often reflects the outlook at the time of diagnosis, not after treatment has been tried, so it is not very applicable to most palliative care patients in the midst of treamtents. Historical survival analyses of untreated patients (either never treated or in \"best supportive care only\" arm of randomized trials) can be found for some cancer types but with new treatments repeatedly being discovered, it becomes difficult to compare a general prognosis from a study to the patient in front of you. [39][40][41][42][43][44] Most importantly, \"the median is not the message.\" The survival curve in advanced cancer follows an approximately exponential function, so 80% of individuals will survive somewhere between one sixth and four times the median, the remaining 20% falling outside even this wide range. 45 Therefore the median has very little meaning for the individual patient. 46,47 The physician's goal is to formulate an individualized prognosis for the patient; starting with a generalized prognosis and modifying it, according to the patient's using clinical observations, performance status, symptoms, comorbidities, will-to-live, and knowledge of illness trajectories. 47,48 The accuracy of survival predications Deciding whether to use CPS or AES or a combination should be determined by which is the most accurate but the comparison is not straightforward. There are two main types of survival predictions, temporal (the patient will live a certain amount of time), expressed either as a continuous or categorical variable or probabilistic (the percentage chance of surviving to a certain time). Most studies of CPS have looked at temporal predictions where as most prognostic indexes (AES) provide probabilistic predictions. Not surprisingly, probabilistic predictions turn out to be more accurate than temporal ones. The accuracy of probabilistic predictions is on the order of 50%-75% 21,49 ; the accuracy of temporal predictions is poor, of the order of 25% (an accurate prediction being defined as the observed survival being \u03ee 33% of the predicted survival). 50 Few studies have compared probabilistic CPS and AES, and when they have, generally find only small differences in the accuracy of the two methods. 12,51 When analyzing prediction research, it is important to understand the terminology of measurement, including the terms discrimination, calibration, accuracy, and precision. Discrimination is the correct allocation of individuals from two or more discrete populations to the correct subpopulation without mismatch. Calibration is the adjustment of an instrument so the distribution of its measurements matches a standard. 21,52 Accuracy measures the difference between all measured values (estimates) and the true value. This difference between the mean estimates for a population and the true survival allows us to discover if any optimistic or pessimistic biases exist. Precision defines how closely all estimates are to each other with repeated measurement. Tools can discriminate if probabilistic predictions are accurate and precise. Physicians are well calibrated if their temporal predictions are accurate and precise.

A recent systematic review in patients with terminal cancer indicated CPS accounted for approximately half of the variance in observed survival, which was more than did the usual prognostic factors employed for AES (performance status, symptoms, abnormal laboratory tests). 53 The review also found a positive linear correlation between predicted survival and actual survival to 6 months but not beyond, thus confirming physicians' ability to discriminate between groups of terminally ill patients with cancer, according to their short-term survival. However, physicians are not well calibrated, as demonstrated by CPS being consistently inaccurate and biased in the overly optimistic direction-by as much as a factor of 3 to 5. 50 The experience and specialty of the physician and the nature of the physician-patient relationship may be confounders for the accuracy of the CPS. 49,50 A prospective study of CPS when making referrals to a U.S. hospice indicated academic oncologists were more accurate than community oncologists or family physicians and more experienced physicians were more accurate. However, this increased accuracy was blunted if the relationship between the physician and patient was strong. This led the authors to suggest an experienced but dispassionate specialist physician was likely to be the most accurate and might be requested for a prognostic 'second opinion' if an accurate prognosis was deemed essential (e.g., deciding to withdraw life sustaining treatment). 50 Despite its limitations, there are certain advantages to using CPS rather than AES, and palliative care clinicians should cultivate their prognostic skills. Some of these advantages include:\n\u2022 The results of prognostic index studies may not be applicable to the patient. \u2022 Requisite prognostic factors to calculate a prognostic index (e.g., recent laboratory test results) may not be available. \u2022 Some prognostic tools require the CPS as an input. \u2022 The index may not provide prognostic information in the format required for the clinical situation.\nThe European Association of Palliative Care's Working Group on Prognostication has recently recommended CPS is a valid means to obtain a general prognostic evaluation of patients but is subject to a se-ries of factors limiting its accuracy.

Some of the more widely recognized prognostic tools researched and statistically validated in various patient populations are described briefly in Appendix A. The authors recommend the reader to become familiar with any tool before applying it in clinical practice.\nA key concept for palliative care physicians to appreciate when considering prognostic factors in advanced cancer is that tumor-related factors important in the earlier stages of the disease (e.g., primary tumor site, size, grade, extent of disease, marker levels, chromosomal abnormalities) are much less important than factors related to the individual with the disease. 55,56 Some of the common patient-related factors in many prognostic indices include:\n\u2022 Performance status (Karnofsky, Palliative Performance Scales); \u2022 Signs and symptoms relating to nutritional status (e.g., anorexia, weight loss); \u2022 Other key symptoms, particularly dyspnea and confusion (but not pain); and \u2022 Some simple biologic parameters: serum albumin level, number of white blood cells and lymphocyte ratio. 54,[56][57][58] A current limitation of applying actuarial judgment to palliative care prognoses is these factors only account for a small part (approximately one third) of the variance in observed survival, and novel prognostic factors are urgently needed.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION", "text": "While physicians have barriers to effective and frequent prognostication, it is a core clinical skill for the", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "GLARE AND SINCLAIR 90", "text": "palliative care physician to develop and maintain. Just as palliative care has influenced the mainstream health care system with its contributions to pain management and end of life care, it can also take a leadership role in making prognostication less difficult and stressful for others. While we should take a much broader view of prognostication, the main contribution we can make is in formulating (and communicating) survival predictions. While an increasing number of easy-to-use tools are becoming available to the clinician for this purpose, there is still a strong case for clinicians to cultivate subjective judgment skills. Developments in clinical epidemiology, biostatistical computing, and the conceptual basis of prognostication are leading to rapid developments in this area and palliative care physicians are at the forefront of this endeavor. More research needs to be done on all aspects of predicting death and other outcomes in palliative care.\nHippocrates wrote his Book of Prognostics more than 4000 years ago. Since then, medicine has only recently begun to reexamine this critical component of compassionate and scientific medical care. He closed his book with the following words, which are just as relevant today:\n\"he who would correctly identify beforehand those that will recover, and those that will die, and in what cases the disease will be protracted for many days, and in what cases for a shorter time, must be able to form a judgment . . . and reason correctly of them.\" 59 ", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "TOOLS FOR PATIENTS WITH AN ANTICIPATED SURVIVAL OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "National Hospice Study, United States, 1988", "text": "One of the earliest prognostic indices developed was generated from data collected from the cancer patients at the time of hospice enrollment for the National Hospice Organization (now the NHPCO) study in the 1980s. 60 The model combines performance state and symptoms to determine a probabilistic prognosis.

The final model included (in decreasing order of contribution):\n\u2022 The physiology score.\n\u2022 Glasgow Coma Scale score. \u2022 Age.\n\u2022 Disease class.\n\u2022 Length of hospital stay.\n\u2022 Cancer as comorbidity.\nThe physiology score is calculated by an extremely complicated mathematical formula given in the Appendix A of the article by Knaus et al. 12 utilizing 11 measures-disease type, vital signs, and biochemical parameters (including PaO 2 )-recorded on day 3 of the hospitalization. The model used this information to generate individualized probabilities for surviving to 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. There were approximately 600 participants in SUPPORT with a primary diagnosis of lung cancer or metastatic colon cancer, and they had an overall median survival of 4-5 months. The model could predict which patients would be alive at 180 days with an accuracy of 78%. By comparison, the accuracy of their treating physicians' predictions of six months survival or not was 77%, more evidence physicians can discriminate when it comes to CES in advanced cancer. The authors interpreted this to show accurate objective estimates judgments such as the SUPPORT model provides can be generated and they can complement clinical judgment when making vital end-of-life decisions. Combining the physician judgment and the SUPPORT model's predictions increased accuracy slightly, to 82%.

When each negative predictor scores one point, the likelihood of survival to 3 months is more than 95% for 0-1 points, 60%-75% for 2 points, and less than 20% for 3-4 points. When tested, the overall accuracy of prediction was 80%-90%, with 97%-99% specificity.\nIn the late 1990s a Finnish group obtained similar types of results, the five most powerful determinants of survival in inoperable lung cancer being disease extent, performance status, clinical symptom score, tumor size and hemoglobin level. These key prognostic variables of the index had equal impact on survival. Thus, based only on the number of adverse factors, the patient falls into one of the six possible prognostic groups. Ninety-eight patients (47%) with three or more risk factors had a 2year survival rate of less than 2%, whereas 17 patients (8%) with no risk factor had a survival of 53% during a minimum follow up of 2 years. 88 A recent retrospective analysis of 112 patients with clinical stage III NSCLC enrolled in four radiation therapy oncology group studies at a single institution again showed a KPS \u0545 70 and comorbidities (severity index \u03fe 2 on Charlson score) were independently associated with inferior overall survival, whereas clinical tumor stage was not. 89 Recently, a French national study group has developed and validated a simple prognostic index for 4year mortality in patients with NSCLC. 90 More than 4000 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 49 months.

A growing body of literature [1][2][3][4][5] as well as attention from the lay press [6][7][8] raised awareness of and questions about the role of spirituality in health care. Surveys have demonstrated that spirituality is a patient need, 9,10 that it affects health care decision-making, 11,12 and that spirituality affects health care outcomes including quality of life. [13][14][15][16][17][18] Spiritual and religious beliefs can also create distress and increase the burdens of illness. 19,20 Studies have raised critical issues including the need for a commonly accepted definition of spirituality, the appropriate application of spiritual care in palliative care settings, clarification about who should deliver spiritual care, the role of health care providers in spiritual care, and ways to increase scientific rigor surrounding spirituality and spiritual care research and practice. These issues and the current variability in delivering spiritual care as a component of palliative care raised awareness of the need for guidelines for ensuring quality care. To this end, a Consensus Conference sponsored by the Archstone Foundation of Long Beach, California, was held February 17 -18, 2009, in Pasadena, California. The Conference was based on the belief that spiritual care is a fundamental component of quality palliative care. According to the National Consensus Project (NCP) for Quality Palliative Care, 21 ''The goal of palliative care is to prevent and relieve suffering and to support the best possible quality of life for patients and their families, regardless of the stage of the disease or the need for other therapies.'' Palliative care is viewed as applying to patients from the time of diagnosis of serious illness to death. In this way, the principles of spiritual care can be applicable across all phases and settings for the seriously ill, without regard to culture, religious tradition, or spiritual frames of reference.\nThe goal of the Consensus Conference was to identify points of agreement about spirituality as it applies to health care and to make recommendations to advance the delivery of quality spiritual care in palliative care. Five literature-based categories of spiritual care (spiritual assessment, models of care and care plans, interprofessional team training, quality improvement, and personal and professional development)\nwere identified and provided the framework for the Consensus Conference. The resulting document and conference recommendations builds upon prior literature, the NCP Guidelines 21 and National Quality Forum (NQF) Preferred Practices 22 and Conference proceedings. This article represents the final Consensus Report. An expanded description of the Conference content and each section of this article is currently in preparation and will be published as a book.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Palliative Care Guidelines and Preferred Practices", "text": "The first clinical practice guidelines for palliative care were released in 2004 by the NCP 23 ; the guidelines were revised and a second edition was published in 2009. 21 These guidelines are applicable to specialist-level palliative care (e.g., palliative care teams) delivered in a wide range of treatment settings and to the work of providers in primary treatment settings where palliative approaches to care are integrated into daily clinical practice (e.g., oncology, critical care, long-term care). Specifically these Clinical Practice Guidelines are intended to 1. Facilitate the development and improvement of clinical palliative care programs providing care to diverse patients and families with life-limiting or debilitating illness. 2. Establish uniformly accepted definitions of the essential elements in palliative care that promote quality, consistency, and reliability of these services. 3. Establish national goals for access to quality palliative care. 4. Foster performance measurement and quality improvement initiatives in palliative care services.\nThe guidelines address eight domains of care: structure and processes; physical aspects; psychological and psychiatric aspects; social aspects; spiritual, religious, and existential aspects; cultural aspects; imminent death; and ethical and legal aspects.\nThe successful dissemination of the NCP guidelines led next to collaboration with the NQF. Building on the NCP Guidelines, the NQF released a set of preferred practices for palliative care in 2006. 22 This was a major advancement in the field of palliative care given the status of NQF as the nation's major private-public partnership responsible for identifying and approving evidence-based quality measures linked to reimbursement in all parts of the health care system. NQF involvement also was crucial in attracting the interest of policymakers in this field. Using the 8 NCP domains for its framework structure, the NQF identified 38 preferred practices to operationalize the NCP Guidelines and to set the foundation for future measurement of the outcomes of care. These practices are evidence-based or have been endorsed through expert opinion and apply to both hospice and palliative care. The 2009 NCP Guidelines 21 and the NQF Preferred Practices 22 (Table 1) served as the foundation for the recommendations for the Consensus Conference.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Consensus Conference Design and Organization", "text": "Achieving a consensus on spiritual care, both conceptually and pragmatically, requires engagement, deliberation, and dialogue among key stakeholders. Conference participation was by invitation. Invitees included a representative sample of 40 national leaders, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, chaplains and clergy, other spiritual care providers, and health care administrators (Table 2). Participants agreed to develop a consensus-driven definition of spirituality, make recommendations to improve spiritual care in palliative care settings, identify resources to advance the quality of spiritual care to be made available through the George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health SOERCE website, 24 and help with dissemination of the final documents. Prior to the conference, participants received a written overview of spiritual care as a dimension of palliative care drafted by Christina Puchalski, M.D. and Betty Ferrell, Ph.D., R.N., Principal Investigators. This document was, in effect, the first draft of this Consensus Report and incorporated feedback from an advisory committee and conference participants. It provided a common base from which the group could identify recommendations to improve spiritual care.\nThe conference began with an overview of the purpose of the conference, its structure, and its relation to the existing NCP guidelines and NQF preferred practices. This was followed by an overview of the developing Consensus Report, its structure, and areas of agreement and disagreement based the participants' reviews. The conference was facilitated by a consultant who established ''ground rules'' to create a safe environment for discussion and disagreement, for sharing all ideas, and for respect and the opportunity to speak without fear of judgment about diverse views.\nAt the conclusion of the first plenary session, participants attended one of five preassigned working groups each with an assigned facilitator. Each working group developed a proposed definition of spirituality and identified the key components of spirituality. After the first working group session, participants reviewed all the definitions and components and, using a consensus process, reached initial agreement on a definition and its important components.\nThe second plenary session began with a brief overview of the literature in spirituality and spiritual care. This was followed by a second working group session in which participants (in their same preassigned groups) were asked to focus on one of five key areas of spiritual care: Models and Treatment Plans, Assessment, Interprofessional Team=Training, Quality Improvement, and Personal and Professional Development. Facilitators asked each group to consider the following questions according to their specific group topic:\n1. What are the issues identified in addressing the topic in spiritual care? 2. What are the barriers in implementing the topic? 3. What are the recommendations for the topic in applying spiritual care as a dimension of palliative care? 4. What resources or implementation strategies are available for the topic? 5. The conference facilitator received all of the written notes from the working groups, synthesized all the comments, and prepared a compilation for all participants to discuss on Day 2.\nOn Day 2, using a consensus process, conference participants finalized the definition of spirituality within the context of a health care environment. Critical elements of the definition included meaning, connectedness to spirituality as an aspect of humanity, and the search for the significant or sacred. In addition, spirituality was defined as being inclusive", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "886", "text": "PUCHALSKI ET AL.\nof philosophical, religious, spiritual, and existential issues that arise in the clinical setting. These elements were grounded in theological, philosophical, empirical, and clinical literature. 25,26 The agreed upon definition is as follows:\nSpirituality is the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred.\nThe participants then reviewed the Consensus Document considering their work from the previous day. Participants were asked to identify areas in the document that were missing or required further elaboration or clarification and, once again, to comment on all aspects of the document. Verbal and written comments were collected.\nOver the following 2 months this Consensus Document was revised yet again to incorporate the feedback from conference participants.

The care is rooted in spirituality using compassion, hopefulness, and the recognition that, although a person's life may be limited or no longer socially productive, it remains full of possibility. 27 Spiritual care is grounded in important theoretical frameworks, one of which is the Biopsychosocial-Spiritual Model of Care. 28,29 Another is a patient-centered care model in which the focus of care is on the patient and his or her experience of illness as opposed to a sole focus on the disease. 30 Integral to both of these models is the recognition that there is more to the care of the patient than the physical.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Biopsychosocial-spiritual model of care", "text": "The work of Engel 31 and White 32 proposed a biopsychosocial model for care that can readily be extended to encompass the spiritual 29 (Fig. 1). This approach is based on a philosophical anthropology, a cornerstone of which is the concept of the person as a being-in-relationship. Jonas 33 said, ''Life is essentially relationship; and relation as such implies 'transcendence,' a going-beyond-itself on the part of that which entertains the relation.'' Disease can be understood as a disturbance in the right relationships that constitute the unity and integrity of what we know to be a human being. Humans are intrinsically spiritual since all persons are in relationship with themselves, others, nature, and the significant or sacred.\nTo know a thing is to grasp the complex set of relationships that define it, whether that thing is a quark or a human being. 34 This is especially true of living things.\nContemporary scientific healing retains the same formal structure that informed prescientific cultures-healing is still about the restoration of right relationships. Illness disturbs more than relationships inside the human organism; it disrupts families and workplaces, shatters preexisting patterns of coping, and raises questions about one's relationship with the significant or the sacred. 29 According to the biopsychosocialspiritual model, everyone has a spiritual history. For many people, this spiritual history unfolds within the context of an explicit religious tradition; for others it unfolds as a set of philosophical principles or significant experiences. Regardless, this spiritual history helps shape who each patient is as a whole person. When life-threatening illness strikes, it strikes each person in his or her totality. 35 This totality includes not simply the biologic, psychological, and social aspects of the person, 36 but also the spiritual aspects as well. 37,38 The biologic, psychological, social, and spiritual are distinct dimensions of each person.

A spiritual history can be integrated into existing formats such as the social history section of the clinical database. Compared to screening, history-taking uses a broader set of questions to capture salient information about needs, hopes, and resources. The history questions are asked in the context of a comprehensive examination by the clinician who is responsible for providing direct care or referrals to specialists. The information from the history permits the clinician to understand how spiritual concerns could either complement or complicate the patient's overall care. It also allows the clinician to incorporate spiritual care into the patient's overall care plan. Unlike spiritual screening, which requires only brief training, those doing a spiritual history should have some education in and comfort with issues that may emerge and knowledge of how to engage patients comfortably in this discussion.\nThe There are clinical history tools available that can be used to collect and document clinical information. Several tools have been developed for this purpose including FICA (Faith= Beliefs, Importance, Community, Address in care or action), 41,43 SPIRIT (Spiritual belief system, Personal Spirituality, Integration, Rituals=restrictions, Implications, and Terminal events), 40 HOPE (Hope, Organized religion, Personal spirituality, Effects of care and decisions), 39 and Domains of Spirituality (developed for use by social workers). 44 Generally, these tools include more objective data (e.g., religious affiliation, spiritual practices) while touching upon deeper and more subjective spiritual aspects (e.g., meaning, importance of belief, sources of hope).", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Spiritual assessment", "text": "Formal spiritual assessment refers to a more extensive process of active listening to a patient's story conducted by a board-certified chaplain that summarizes the needs and resources that emerge in that process. The chaplain's summary should include a spiritual care plan with expected outcomes that is then communicated to the rest of the treatment team. Unlike history-taking, the major models for spiritual assessment are not built on a set of questions that can be used in an interview. Rather, the models are interpretive frameworks that are based on listening to the patient's story as it unfolds. Because of the complex nature of these assessments and the special clinical training necessary to engage in them, this assessment should be done only by a board-certified chaplain or an equivalently prepared spiritual care provider.\nWhen each level of evaluation occurs depends on the setting and who is asking the questions. In hospitals, nursing homes, or hospices, spiritual screening should be done by the nurse or social worker upon triage or admission in order to assess for spiritual emergencies that may require immediate intervention. In outpatient settings, a spiritual screening might not take place as an event separate from the clinical encounter. Rather, if the patient comes to the physician's office in distress, a spiritual screening might be done as part of the initial conversation with the physician, advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant. A spiritual history could be done by the physician, nurse, social worker, or other clinician responsible for developing and assessment and treatment plan. The spiritual assessment would be done by a board-certified chaplain.  3 and 4). Health care professionals involved in assessing and referring patients should identify spiritual issues or make spiritual diagnoses if applicable. Some spiritual diagnosis labels currently exist but these may be limited in scope (e.g., to patients with cancer) and also are not presently used for reimbursement. Thus a clinician may identify a spiritual issue or a patient's sources of strength or the clinician may identify a spiritual diagnosis. In general a spiritual issue becomes a diagnosis if the following criteria are met:\n1. The spiritual issue leads to distress or suffering (e.g., lack of meaning, conflicted religious beliefs, inability to forgive). 2. The spiritual issue is the cause of a psychological or physical diagnosis such as depression, anxiety, or acute or chronic pain (e.g., severe meaninglessness that leads to depression or suicidality, guilt that leads to chronic physical pain). 3. The spiritual issue is a secondary cause or affects the presenting psychological or physical diagnosis (e.g., hypertension is difficult to control because the patient refuses to take medications because of his or her religious beliefs).\nIf there is an interprofessional team involved then a boardcertified chaplain, as the expert in spiritual care, provides the input and guidance as to the diagnosis and treatment plan with respect to spirituality. In situations were there is no interprofessional team, health care professionals identify the issues or make the diagnoses and develop the treatment plan. These clinicians are responsible for referring complex spiritual issues to a board-certified chaplain. For simple issues, such as a patient wanting to learn about yoga, meditation, or art or music therapy, the health care professional can make the appropriate referral or implement a course of action. For the more complex spiritual issues, referral to a board-certified chaplain or other spiritual care provider is critical. Use of decision tree algorithms may facilitate the care process. Figure 4 is an example of one such algorithm.\nSeveral surveys have demonstrated that some patients would like to be able to pray with their physicians and nurses. 45,46 A survey conducted by Stanford University Medical Center, ABC News, and USA Today in 2005 47 reported that prayer is the second most commonly used method that hospitalized patients rely upon for pain control, after opioid analgesics. Astrow 1 and Lo 48 have developed guidelines for praying with patients that could be adapted a priori. Regardless, prayer requests from patients should be handled sensitively and compassionately.\nTables 5 and 6 are examples of how spiritual care can be incorporated into a treatment plan. These plans should include input from the interprofessional team and be updated on a regular basis based on appropriate follow-up and reevaluation.\nEvaluation and follow-up NCP Guidelines 21 call for periodic reevaluation of the impact of spiritual=existential interventions and patient and family preferences.

Physicians and advance practice nurses can consult with social workers and outpatient chaplains or other equivalently trained spiritual care professionals.

The team leader must strike a balance between the role of ''captain'' and the role of facilitator or convener. Each team member must be aware of and respect the professional ethics of other team members. Any team member who cooperates in, or fails to object to, any harmful act is a moral accomplice. Team dynamics also can raise ethical issues. In the interest of harmony, team members can become too compliant or be too eager to be seen as ''good team-players.''

All board-certified chaplains have at least 1600 hours of clinical pastoral education. Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) is interfaith professional education for ministry. It brings theological students and ministers of all faiths (pastors, priests, rabbis, imams, and others) into supervised encounters with persons in crisis. At the conclusion of this course of study CPE students are considered competent in pastoral formation and providing spiritual support to people of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural backgrounds.

Inherent to the proposed spiritual care model is the transformation that occurs when a health care professional and a patient interact in a professional relationship.

To be open to that, the professional must have an awareness of the spiritual dimensions of their own lives and then be supported in the practice of compassionate presence with patients through a reflective process.\nWhen considering professional development and spiritual formation, health care providers must overcome barriers to the idea of health care as a spiritual undertaking. Health care providers form deeper and more meaningful connections with the patients by developing an awareness of their own values, beliefs, and attitudes, particularly regarding their own mortality. Many physicians and nurses speak of their own spiritual practices and how those practices help them deliver good spiritual care, which, in turn, helps in their ability to deliver good physical and psychosocial care to the seriously ill and dying patients. Reflective work is required in order to gain insight into one's own sense of spirituality, meaning, and professional calling in order to have the capacity to provide compassionate and skillful care.

The first important characteristic to note is the marked power imbalance between the professional and the patient. The sick, and especially those who are dying, often feel they have little control over their lives. All the power and control is perceived as belonging to the health care professional who must never exploit a patient's weakness or vulnerability. Health care professionals have a profound moral obligation to be trustworthy and to use their power in the interests of their patients. 1,64 Second, there is a deep sense of intimacy regarding the spiritual aspects of a person's life. The one granted such access must exercise care, restraint, and confidentiality. Finally, it is important to recognize that while spiritual concerns can assume a particular importance at the end of life, attention to the spiritual needs of patients is not something to be reserved 900 PUCHALSKI ET AL.\nonly for patients approaching death. Consistent with the philosophy of the NCP Guidelines and NQF Preferred Practices, palliative care is appropriate regardless of disease status, can begin at the time of early diagnosis, and attention to spiritual needs should be integrated across the trajectory of illness.\nBoundaries. In order to ensure appropriate therapeutic relationships with patients and families, boundaries need to be recognized for the benefit of all concerned. Boundaries are mutually understood, unspoken physical, emotional, social, and spiritual limits for the health care professional and patient. The health care professional-patient relationship is often a one-way relationship that lacks equality and reciprocity. Boundaries allow for compassionate presence in the healing encounter. Health care professionals are more vulnerable to crossing these boundaries when they are overworked, stressed, or have experienced chronic losses or grief. Thus, it is critical that institutions and individual professionals make opportunities for appropriate self-care and reflection to avoid these risks.\nProhibition on Proselytizing in the Clinical Setting. Some clinicians may be motivated to proselytize by virtue of a zealous devotion to their own faith or spiritual commitments. A health care professional is never justified advising patients to ''get religion'' even if his or her intent is beneficent. Proselytizing within the clinical relationship is a violation of the trust the patient has give to the health care professional and inappropriate in the context of the professional relationship between the patient and the clinician.\nImportantly, the prohibition on proselytizing should not be construed as a prohibition on asking patients about their spiritual or religious beliefs and practices. Skillful spiritual screening, history-taking, and assessments should not be threatening to patients or specific to one denomination, faith tradition, or philosophical orientation. Encounters regarding spirituality should not imply a particular answer that the patient can presume the health care professional considers ''correct'' but rather should open a dialogue that can be tailored to the specific needs of the individual patient.

Assessing relief of suffering, forgiveness, meaning in life, and other abstract aspects of spiritual care require approaches that exceed the capacity of the usual quantitative metrics applied to other aspects of health care. Therefore, spiritual experts need to have creative input into developing measures that will adequately assess spiritual care. Spiritual metrics that reflect the goals of spiritual care need to be developed. These metrics might include an increase in chaplain referrals, improved patient satisfaction, and lower scores on a spiritual distress scale as a result of attention to patients' spiritual concerns.\nImproving the quality of spiritual care as a function of quality improvement processes will require attention to the unique aspects of this domain of care. Some quantitative approaches may be applicable. For example, hospice and palliative care programs can adapt quantitative methods for assessing referrals to chaplaincy, rates of completion of spiritual assessment, and the incorporation of desired rituals into the treatment plan.

A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis", "abstract": "Introduction: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) complicate many advanced malignancies and the median prognosis for those who develop MPEs is 6 months. These effusions lead patients to suffer from significant dyspnea, which may consequently impair mobility and lead to reduced quality of life. There are several treatment options for those with MPE. Thoracentesis may be quick and relatively easy to perform, but has a high recurrence rate; chest tube placement with talc slurry is quite effective at achieving pleurodesis, but this procedure can be quite painful and requires hospitalization. An alternative option is outpatient placement of the Pleurx \u00d2 catheter (Denver Biomedical Inc., Denver, CO) for home-based drainage of effusions. Objective: To determine the incremental cost effectiveness of treating MPE with talc pleurodesis versus placement of Pleurx \u00d2 catheter. Methods: We used decision analysis to compare treatments for the management of MPE. Cost data for Pleurx \u00d2 and talc treatments were obtained using Medicare reimbursement data for 2008, and outcome data (probability of treatment success and=or complication, and utility of health states) were obtained through literature review. Results: Under our base-case analysis, treatment with talc was less costly than Pleurx \u00d2 (talc, $8170.80; Pleurx \u00d2 , $9011.60) with similar effectiveness (talc, 0.281 quality adjusted life years [QALYs]; Pleurx \u00d2 , 0.276 QALYs). Pleurx \u00d2 became more cost effective (<$100K=QALY) when life expectancy was 6 weeks or less.The treatment choice (talc pleurodesis or Pleurx \u00d2 catheter) for those with an MPE and a prognosis of 6 months should be based on the clinical situation and patient preferences, as well as local expertise and success rates of the procedures. A prospective study specific to the palliative care population might help to clarify which treatment is more cost effective in this population in which optimizing quality of life is essential.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "M alignant pleural effusions (MPE) complicate many advanced malignancies. The prognosis for those who develop MPEs is poor with a median 6-month survival. [1][2][3][4] Patients with MPE suffer from significant dyspnea, which may impair mobility and lower quality of life. 5,6 The prevalence of dyspnea may be as high as 50%, emphasizing the need for effective management of these patients who are already facing a limited life span. 7 There are several treatment options for those with MPE, including thoracentesis, talc pleurodesis, or placement of a long-term indwelling catheter. Thoracentesis may be quick and relatively easy to perform, but has a 98% recurrence rate at 30 days. 5 Repeat thoracentesis may be recommended for those patients with advanced disease. 8 Chest tube placement with talc slurry is effective at achieving pleurodesis, but this procedure can be painful and requires hospitalization (mean stay was 7 days in two recent studies 6,9 ). A newer treatment option involves the placement of a long-term indwelling catheter (Pleurx \u00d2 , Denver Biomedical Inc., Denver, CO), which can be performed on an outpatient basis with a low complication rate.

This analysis may also be of interest to hospice organizations although some costs such as pain medications and home aide services have not been incorporated in our model. One important goal of those providing hospice treatment for patients with MPE is to avoid less effective, more costly treatments, while maximizing patient quality of life.\nIn our base-case scenario, treatment with the catheter was only slightly more costly and less effective than treatment with talc, suggesting that treatment choice should be based on the clinical situation and patient preferences.

These costs are difficult to estimate, and depend highly on the clinical situation (for example, for patients who cannot tolerate oral medications, more expensive intravenous or transdermal medications might be required). Although we did not include these costs, it is likely that the Pleurx \u00d2 treatment would continue to be dominated since the success of this treatment is lower than that of talc (and those with treatment failure are the ones who might require pain medications and= or oxygen). Our assumption that patients with the catheter require three nursing visits per week was also difficult to estimate; however, when we performed an analysis using two visits per week, Pleurx \u00d2 continued to be the more costly treatment. Patients who are able to perform the drainage themselves, or have family to perform the drainage, may incur less nursing costs and shift the model toward a preference for Pleurx \u00d2 . Another limitation of our model is that we did not include physician service fees for inpatients; these costs are highly dependent on the clinical situation. We were also limited by the heterogeneity of the data obtained from our review of the published literature and the assumptions we made regarding patient utilities, but we attempted to choose data for our model that best represents our clinical experience with such patients, and performed sensitivity analysis over the published ranges.\nWe believe that our model is highly representative of the clinical decision pathway for patients with MPE, and is an accurate depiction of the possible outcomes for those treated with Pleurx \u00d2 catheter or talc pleurodesis.

Previous psychometric testing of the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) demonstrated internal consistency and convergent validity with dyspnea self-report and discriminant validity with pain and no dyspnea. Additional testing was needed with patients unable to self-report. The aim of this study was to establish further the reliability and construct validity of a revised RDOS. Methods: An observational design was used with 89 consecutive patients referred for inpatient palliative care consultation and at risk for dyspnea who had one or more of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or pneumonia. Patients were observed and the RDOS scored once each day for up to three days after the initial consultation. Other measures included: dyspnea self-report, neurologic diagnoses, opioid or benzodiazepine use, peripheral oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide level, consciousness, cognitive state, nearness to death, and patient demographics. Results: Perfect interrater reliability across data collectors was achieved. No differences in RDOS scoring were found by patient demographics. RDOS was associated with use of oxygen ( p < 0.01), oxygen saturation ( p < 0.01) and nearness to death ( p < 0.01). A significant decrease in RDOS was found over time corresponding with treatment ( p < 0.01). The reliability of this 8-item scale using Cronbach a is 0.64. Conclusions: Declining consciousness and=or cognition are expected when patients are near death. The RDOS performed well when tested with terminally ill patients who were at risk for respiratory distress, most of whom could not self-report dyspnea. The tool is sensitive to detect changes over time and measure response to treatment. The RDOS is simple to use; scoring takes less than 5 minutes. The RDOS has clinical and research utility to measure and trend respiratory distress and response to treatment.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "D yspnea is measured currently using scales and instruments that rely on the patient's ability to self-report, such as a numeric rating, or a visual analogue scale (VAS). The simplest report is a ''yes'' or ''no'' response to the question ''Are you short of breath?'' Yet, as death nears the ability to provide a self-report may become difficult or impossible or yield an ambiguous response. 1,2 Cognitively impaired patients with pain retained some ability to self-report with coaching and assistance from clinicians when the cognitive impairment was mild or moderately advanced, but patients with severe cognitive impairment had poor report completion rates. 3 More than half the patients observed in this investigation were unable to respond with yes or no; findings reported previously. 4 Cognitive decline and decreasing consciousness from hemodynamic, blood gas or metabolic derangements typifies the period before death. Theoretically, the same physiological changes that evoke dyspnea in the patient with intact cognition will produce respiratory distress when the patient is experiencing declining cognition; respiratory distress may be observed if not reported. 5 Inability to report symptom distress is not synonymous with an inability to experience suffering. Patients who are unable to provide a report about any dyspnea experienced are vulnerable to undertreatment or overtreatment.\nA focused audit of deceased nursing home residents' medical records was undertaken to assess characteristics during the last 48 hours of life. Fifty-one percent of residents were cognitively impaired from various causes and dyspnea was the most prevalent recorded symptom (62%) but it was not treated in 23% of residents with this symptom. 6 Similarly, in a mortality follow-back survey of the families of Medicare decedents nearly 24% of nursing home patients did not receive enough help with dyspnea. 7 Conversely, patients unable to self-report may be overtreated when unable to validate the clinician's assessment producing unintended hastening of death. In a systematic review of ventilator withdrawal methods wide variance in opioid administration with a trend toward high doses even in the context of patient unconsciousness was found. 8 Objective measurement of respiratory distress using a biobehavioral framework may enhance the clinician's ability to recognize, treat, and measure response to treatment of respiratory distress. An observation method has the advantage of allowing an observer to elicit information when it is not obtainable by other methods. 9 Additionally, the systematic observation of respiratory distress behaviors may allow for inclusion of patients with impaired cognition in clinical studies of dyspnea, including those who are dying who heretofore have been largely excluded.\nA Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS) was developed and preliminary testing, reported elsewhere, 10 demonstrated that the earlier version seven-item scale had sufficient internal consistency, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity when tested with cognitively intact patients with dyspnea or pain and healthy volunteers. Patient reports about dyspnea were compared to displayed behaviors in three groups of 70 patients or volunteers (n \u00bc 210). Pulmonary rehabilitation patients were assessed after controlled exercise while hypoxemic and subsequently asked to report current dyspnea on a dyspnea VAS. Patients with postoperative orthopedic pain were evaluated with the RDOS and asked to report current pain and dyspnea. Healthy volunteers were assessed with the RDOS at rest and asked to report current dyspnea. A positive correlation between the RDOS and VAS ( p < 0.01) and an inverse correlation between RDOS and peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo 2 ; p < 0.01) were found indicating convergent and construct validity respectively. Significant mean differences were found when RDOS scores from dyspneic patients were compared to RDOS from patients with pain ( p < 0.01) and with healthy volunteers ( p < 0.01) indicating discriminant validity. 10 The instrument was subsequently revised with addition of another variable, paradoxical breathing pattern, because this clinical sign occurred with relative frequency in a previous study to determine the behavioral correlates to an asphyxial threat. Paradoxical breathing pattern was observed in 33% of patients at risk for respiratory distress while undergoing a mechanical ventilator weaning trial. 11 Testing the revised eight-item scale with terminally ill patients and=or patients unable to self-report dyspnea needed to be established and was the purpose of this study.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Design", "text": "An observation design was used during which adult patients were observed and the revised RDOS was scored.\nConcurrent measures of end-tidal carbon dioxide (et-Co 2 ) and peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo 2 ) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2 ) were done. Consciousness and cognitive testing was done. Conscious patients were asked to report about current dyspnea. Demographic and other data were obtained from the medical record, including age, gender, race, diagnosis, and the administration of opioids or benzodiazepines in the 24-hour interval prior to patient assessment. Opioid and benzodiazepine agents and doses were converted to parenteral morphine and diazepam equivalents to allow comparison across patients.\nSample size/sampling approach. A rough estimate of sample size based on 10 study participants per scale variable yielded 80 participants. We collected data from 99 consecutive eligible patients to allow for missing data which typifies palliative care research. Patients were included in the study if they had one or more of the following diagnoses putting them at risk for experiencing dyspnea: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, or lung cancer. Eligible patients were terminally ill and referred for palliative care consultation. Patients who did not speak English were excluded. A waiver of consent was approved by the Human Investigations Committee at Wayne State University since the patient assessment was noninvasive and entailed examinations that are part of routine care.\nInstruments. The RDOS is an ordinal level scale with eight observer-rated parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, paradoxical breathing pattern, restlessness, grunting at end-expiration, nasal flaring, and a fearful facial display (See Appendix A). Each parameter is scored from 0 to 2 points and the points are summed. Scale scores range from 0 signifying no distress to 16 signifying the most severe distress. Psychometric testing is the purpose of this study.\nThe Reaction Level Scale (RLS85) categorizes consciousness and was developed for use in the ICU. It is an eight level ordinal scale with advantages over the more commonly used Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) because it can be applied with patients who are intubated or have ocular swelling. There is no addition of covarying variables and the instrument tests favorably with the GCS. 12,13 The RLS85 is superior to the GCS in that a significant change signifies a significant change in patient status. 14 Scores range from 1 (alert with no delay in response) to 8 (unconscious with no response to painful stimuli).\nPatients were categorized into levels of cognitive state (intact, mild, moderate, or severe impairment) by their performance on an investigator-developed Cognitive State Categorization Tool (CSCT). Cognitive tests from the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) 15 that measure attention, concentration, memory, recall, and organized thinking were combined to quantify patient cognitive performance and categorize cognitive state. CSCT scores range from 0-28 points. Scores between 22 and 28 points signified intact cognition, 15-21 indicated mild impairment, 8-14 represented moderate impairment and less than 8 signified severe impairment. Construct validity of the CSCT with consciousness (RLS85) was established in this investigation (r s \u00bc \u00c00.66, p < 0.01).\nSpo 2 , et-Co 2 , heart and respiratory rates were measured with a hand-held Nellcor \u00d2 N-85 capnograph=oximeter. This device provides exceptional pulse oximetry performance even during low perfusion states that may typify the study population. Capnography assessment is possible even in nonintubated patients via a nasal capnoline. A capnoline oral= nasal circuitry was applied in the same fashion as a nasal oxygen cannula.\nThe patient's self-report about any dyspnea being experienced was elicited by asking ''Are you short of breath?'' When patients could provide a ''yes'' or ''no'' response they were subsequently asked to quantify distress using a VAS. This was a 100 mm vertical line anchored at 0 \u00bc no distress to 100 \u00bc worst distress with tick marks every 10 mm along the length of the line. This simple to use instrument has been previously tested for reliability and validity. 16 Terminal illness severity was quantified using the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS). This scale grades a patient's general condition as 0% (dead) to 100% (normal) in increments of 10 percentage points. The scale incorporates five observer-rated parameters: ambulation, activity, self-care, intake, and level of consciousness. The scale has been validated with patients with cancer (all types), patients in an acute tertiary hospital setting, home care setting, heterogeneous diagnoses, and a minority population.

Symptom self-report has been held as the most reliable means for evaluating the patient's experience, disease progression and response to treatment. Yet, as patients reach the end of life many experience cognitive impairment of a severity that makes dyspnea reporting ambiguous, unreliable, or impossible. 4 Behavioral evaluation using the RDOS is proposed in the absence of any form of dyspnea report. Patients who are unable to quantify their distress may be able to provide a simple ''yes'' or ''no'' report to a query about distress.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "RESPIRATORY DISTRESS OBSERVATION SCALE 287", "text": "Although behavioral evaluation is a promising alternative to self-report validity of this method can be questioned. It is well understood that many chronically ill patients with lung disease have mastered their distress and will deny distress even in the face of signs of pulmonary stress. Thus, the use of behavioral signs may lack the validity of a self-report; however, in the absence of self-report there is no other means for evaluation. The RDOS is the only known instrument for the behavioral assessment of respiratory distress and this study and our previous investigation 10 have established the internal consistency, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity. We offer this instrument for both clinical application to assess patients and guide treatment and as a research tool.\nThe tool is intended for use with adult patients and possibly adolescents. There has been no testing with children or infants so we caution against application with those populations; infants display other behaviors than adults when in respiratory distress such as sternal retraction. We postulate that the RDOS can be applied to patients across settings of care and diagnoses, although all testing to date has been completed in the acute and critical care settings.\nThe RDOS will not produce a meaningful assessment if the patient is paralyzed with a neuromuscular blocking agent because heart rate would be the only detectable and dynamic variable on the RDOS. Likewise, patients who are in a ''locked-in'' state with paralysis of all muscle groups except ocular will not benefit from assessment with the RDOS. We have not included patients with advanced stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in either of our investigations, so the application to that population is unknown and warrants further investigation. We suspect that some of the RDOS behaviors will not be detectable in ALS, such as accessory muscle use and paradoxical breathing pattern.\nPatient assessment during the withdrawal of mechanical ventilation may be enhanced with the use of the RDOS. In a systematic review of ventilator withdrawal evidence most investigators did not report how patient distress was measured and when reported non-specific indicators were used such as ''signs of dyspnea,'' ''anxiety,'' ''agitation,'' and ''distress.'' 8 Similarly, the RDOS may be useful in ascertaining which patients may benefit from the application of oxygen at the end of life. Oxygen administered via face mask or nasal cannula may reduce dyspnea and is often routinely applied to patients when they are approaching death regardless of the patient's ability to experience or report distress and=or in the absence of behaviors that signify respiratory distress. Oxygen may, however, prolong dying without conferring comfort if the patient is not experiencing distress; additionally, oxygen administration is not without adverse effects and costs. Previous studies of the role of oxygen in advanced and terminal illness have yielded mixed results and an inability to reliably predict which patients benefit from this treatment. 22,23 No previous studies have included patients who were near death or who were unable to provide a self-report about distress.\nInterrater reliability across members of the clinical team who may use the RDOS needs to be established; our perfect inter-rater reliability was achieved between nurse practitioners. Assessment with the RDOS is a registered nurse function; we do not know if the RDOS can be accurately scored by unlicensed personnel or family caregivers.\nStudies about the treatment of dyspnea when patients have life-limiting illnesses are needed. [24][25][26] Gaps in our knowledge about treatment of the patients that are nearest to death exist because an inability to self-report dyspnea has excluded this population from studies. Yet, we found more distress in the patients who were nearest to death in our sample as reported by other investigators 27 supporting our call for more investigation of this vulnerable population. The RDOS is expected to serve as a research tool for measuring respiratory distress and allowing for the inclusion of cognitively impaired patients and those nearest to death in palliative care studies.\nOur study was limited by completion at one institution where the instrument was originally developed and tested. Our demographic is largely African American so there were few Caucasian patients in our sample, however, we found no differences in RDOS scoring by patient race and racial characteristics were not expected to influence the variables that comprise the RDOS.\nOf note, although not an aim of this study, we found a high proportion of patients with respiratory distress who had not received opioids or benzodiazepines before palliative care consultation in the face of strong evidence to support their use, particularly for morphine. 28,29 This finding supports our claim that respiratory distress may be undertreated in patients near death who are unable to self-report dyspnea. This finding further supports the need for the RDOS to guide assessment and treatment of the cognitively impaired patient.

The extent of each curricula varies dramatically among medical schools. 10 Most schools do not offer electives in endof-life care, 11 despite data suggesting that such electives are beneficial. 10,12 Medical students report having limited exposure to dying patients. 13 One survey reported 35% of students never observed a patient being told about a terminal prognosis. 4 Only 38% of interns at one hospital had observed advance directive discussions during medical school. 14 Recalling their first experience giving bad news, trainees reported faculty supervision only 5% of the time. 15 Thus, students may have haphazard and unsupervised clinical experiences caring for the dying.\nMedical students also learn about end-of-life care from unintended messages conveyed from hospital culture. The ''hidden curriculum,'' the implicit learning relayed through faculty and residents' behaviors and institutional constructs, 16 is absorbed as students undergo socialization into physicianship. 17 These unintended lessons often conflict with the formal teaching of palliative medicine that affirms the values of humanism, communication, compassion and self-reflection. 18 Negative attitudes or poorly modeled behaviors may have detrimental effects on trainees' appreciation and delivery of care to dying patients 8,19 Furthermore, acceptance of hidden curriculum ideas may lead to ''ethical erosion,'' or an undermining of students' idealized values. 20 Conversely, education in a setting valuing palliative medicine can lead to improved attitudes toward end-of-life care. 21 We were interested in how these conceptual modalities of learning ascribed to medical school (formal, informal, and hidden curricula) contributed to medical students' perceived preparation to perform end-of-life care, their assessment of the quality of end-of-life care education, and their attitudes toward end-of-life care.

Fourth-year students received explicit teaching in the cognitive domains of end-of-life care (e.g., treating pain) and felt better prepared in these aspects. The majority observed physicians performing end-of-life care, but considerably less had Our result that formal curriculum, operationalized as explicit teaching, was positively and strongly associated with students' perceived preparedness to provide end-of-life care contrasts with prior research. Surveyed senior students with clinical experience were more likely to report feeling prepared to discuss end-of-life issues; but they did not identify formal courses as helpful educational experiences. 4 Third-year medical students at one institution believed that didactic curricula had less impact than mentored experiences on their end-of-life care learning. 26 Perceived intern skill with end-oflife care was associated with the amount of observed end-oflife communication not the amount of formal teaching. 14 Residents surveyed from 12 programs identified clinician role models as the most important educational component of  learning end-of-life care. 27 Our results may differ from prior studies because we included students from 62 schools providing more power and also perhaps minimizing schoolspecific deficiencies or talents. However, our formal curricular scale of ''explicitly taught'' topics may also overlap with informal, bedside learning experiences and not reflect the purely formal didactic sessions referred to in these other studies. Alternatively, the inclusion of formal teaching on end-of-life care may reflect an increased level of overall institutional commitment to end-of-life care education. Each of the three curricula was also associated with students' perceptions of their end-of-life care education quality, and our findings uniquely identify the hidden curriculum as responsible for negative perceptions of quality. In our study, the informal curriculum was positively associated, contradicting a single-institution study reporting that educational quality was inversely correlated with informal curriculum. 28 In that study, the negative association was thought to be secondary to the discordance in messages conveyed by informal experiences and formal teaching. Parsing out the negative messages into a hidden curricular scale suggests that it is the unintended teachings, rather than the modeled care, that negatively affect students' assessments of education quality.\nIt may be that faculty and residents who lack expertise or interest in end-of-life care detract from teachings explicitly conveyed in lectures and at the bedside. 29 Students who discern this discordance may have rated their education lower. Negative messages of the hidden curriculum were also negatively associated with students' perceived preparation and attitudes toward caring for the dying, perhaps by impairing their compassion and confidence. A prior qualitative study found that third-year medicine clerkship students identify attending physician responses to emotion, attitudes and behaviors-components of the hidden curriculum-as crucial to learning about end-of-life care. 26 Others have suggested students, observing the behaviors of residents and attendings, may develop the impression that compassion is more theoretical than practical. 30 The hidden curriculum has been characterized as molding a physician temperament of ''detached concern,'' 31 which conflicts with the ideals of empathy and compassion in palliative care. An environment depersonalizing patients through hidden curriculum messages may hinder student development of end-of-life care skills. To improve skills and attitudes, faculty must promote a humanistic climate and model emotional support for dying patients. 32 Socialization for death is a core component of medical training; faculty can help students overcome detachment by valuing empathic communication and demonstrating compassion.\nStudents' attitudes toward caring for the dying were also associated with informal curricular experiences and students' backgrounds. Formal instruction was not, consistent with prior studies. 12,33 Minorities, specifically black and Asian students, had slightly more negative attitudes, but no differences in perceived preparation. Studies of practicing physicians found minority physicians felt less comfortable discussing end-of-life issues 34,35 ; another found black and white physicians held different preferences toward end-of-life care. 36 Black students more frequently, and Asians less frequently, believed that religion strongly influenced their actions, differing significantly from other groups. Background experiences and cultural differences in attitudes about care of the dying likely continue to impact physicians despite socialization and formal instruction in medical school. However, given the weak effect, the differences may not be meaningful.\nThis study has several important limitations. First, the survey was conducted in 2001 and medical school curricula and institutional attitudes may have changed since then. However, a recent national survey argues otherwise, with little apparent progress in end-of-life care education. 11 Second, survey items may not fully or accurately measure the underlying constructs that we propose. The attitude items, as evident in prior studies, 21,25 do not cohesively measure a single construct. Our definition of ''formal'' and ''informal'' curriculum by method of learning (explicit teaching vs. observed exposures) may not appropriately differentiate these types of curricula. Defining formal curriculum as ''explicitly taught'' topics may not represent learning distinct from informal bedside demonstrations. The survey relies on recall of experiences. The self-perceived preparedness likely reflects confidence, not skill. The survey items have content validity, but none of the curricular instruments have been formally validated against other measures. Finally, this cross-sectional survey can identify associations, but cannot determine the causal relationships between these variables. Additional research is needed to address these issues. Despite these limitations, the survey is strengthened by its large number of respondents from many geographically diverse U.S. institutions.\nMedical students absorb lessons from many forms of education, including intentional schooling and implicit messages. They learn end-of-life care from didactics, role-modeled discussions with patients as well as careless comments. The negative hidden curricular messages appear to have a consistently detrimental effect on students' perceptions of end-oflife care and may reflect medical culture. Compared to Britain, U.S. medical students have worse attitudes, less conveyed support by faculty, and overall feel less prepared 37 -perhaps in part because of the hidden curriculum. When students experience disparate messages from formal, informal and hidden curricula, the deficiencies of their medical training may become more apparent. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the messages that permeate the wards and saturate the casual discussions of healthcare staff are those that promote professionalism and end-of-life care. If faculty and residents articulate and exemplify the merits of providing high quality end-of-life care, students may be more likely to have the confidence, experience and enthusiasm to carry this highquality care into their professional lives.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was performed with the financial support of National Institutes of Health Training Grant HL07287.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "", "journal": "non-Hispanic", "year": "", "authors": "Referent White"}, {"title": "References 1.

Methods: This is a multisite, cross-sectional, mixed-methods study of randomly-selected patients with advanced cancer (n \u00bc 68). Scripted interviews assessed the role of R=S and R=S concerns encountered in the advanced cancer experience. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed. Theme extraction was performed with interdisciplinary input (sociology of religion, medicine, theology), utilizing grounded theory. Spearman correlations determined the degree of association between R=S themes. Predictors of R=S concerns were assessed using linear regression and analysis of variance. Results: Most participants (n \u00bc 53, 78%) stated that R=S had been important to the cancer experience. In descriptions of how R=S was related to the cancer experience, five primary R=S themes emerged: coping, practices, beliefs, transformation, and community. Most interviews (75%) contained two or more R=S themes, with 45% mentioning three or more R=S themes. Multiple significant subtheme interrelationships were noted between the primary R=S themes.

The most frequently cited way that R=S facilitated coping was by extending longevity (10 of 39), exemplified by one participant stating, ''You've got to have faith and a positive outlook because it is going to help you last longer.''

Patients reported praying for themselves (21=27), praying more frequently (5=27), receiving prayer from others (4=27), praying with others (3=27), and praying for others (4=31). The most cited reason for prayer was to ask for strength (4=27), illustrated by a patient sharing, ''I just say to God, 'Okay. You're going to give me something to deal with, just give me the strength to deal with it.' '' Other perceived benefits derived from engaging in R=S practices included healing (3=27), guidance (1=27), and perseverance (1=27). Additional R=S practices subthemes mentioned were religious service attendance (6=31), reading sacred writings (1=31), and meditation (1=31).\nThe R=S beliefs theme was defined as patients' references to R=S beliefs important to their experience of cancer. The majority (53%) raised this theme. A common subtheme was the view that R=S plays a significant role in life independent of cancer (13=28), illustrated by comments such as ''religion has always played an important part of my life.'' Also frequently mentioned was a belief in God's will (12=28), exemplified by the statement, ''[based] on my religious beliefs I think I was given a certain number of days on this earth from day one, and I don't think that changes any with my diagnosis . . . It tells me that if God wanted me yesterday, I wouldn't be here today, and if He wants me to survive [cancer] 20 years without a cure, then that's His will also.'' Additional R=S beliefs subthemes included belief in an afterlife (7=28) and beliefs being spiritual but not religious (5=28).\nThe religious=spiritual transformation theme was defined as patients' expressions of transformation in R=S beliefs or participation resulting from the cancer experience, raised by 38% of patients. Several patients mentioned that their cancer engendered a new or deeper reflection on faith and mortality (10=20), reflected in statements such as ''it's a transformative experience to have an illness such as this, and when you have that you have to reevaluate all you've done in life, who you are, and who you're going to be.''

The frequency by which patients spontaneously reported these themes suggests that multiple themes play a meaningful role for the majority of patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, frequent significant correlations between subcategories of the primary themes in exploratory analyses suggest there may be dynamic, complex relationships between the domains. Additionally, most patients with advanced cancer experience one or more R=S concerns. This study provides an inductively derived understanding of the R=S themes active in the cancer experience, their interconnections, and the related R=S concerns that may inform the content of spiritual care.\nThe five R=S themes are consistent with other studies examining how R=S operates among cancer populations. Gall and Cornblat 18 conducted a study of 39 breast cancer survivors and identified similar R=S themes. Prior studies have similarly demonstrated correlations between R=S domains, including interrelationships between meaning, beliefs, and faith 19 and between religious coping and R=S beliefs, practices, and transformation. 14,20 Other studies have noted similar frequencies of spiritual needs. 4,5 The particular R=S concerns we identified are supported by prior reports that have characterized needs and struggle surrounding meaning, 5,21,22 connection with God=higher power, 13 forgiveness, 13 death and the afterlife, 5,22 peace of mind, 4,5 and R=S practices. 21,23 Finally, a study of incurable cancer patients noted similar rates of patients experiencing one or more of the following spiritual struggles: feeling punished, feeling abandoned by God, feeling abandoned by R=S communities, questioning God's love, believing the devil caused the cancer, or questioning God's power. 24 Other qualitative studies grounding spiritual care 21,25 have focused on practitioners' approach to and practices of spiritual care. Daaleman et al. 25 identified three key practitioner qualities in spiritual care provision termed: being present, opening eyes, and cocreating. Hanson et al. 21 assessed spiritual care activities of various caregivers and identified four domains of spiritual care practices: relationship, understanding, coping, and practices. Our study complements these studies by inductively grounding the content of spiritual care based on patients' testimonies and their associated R=S concerns.\nOur findings suggest that comprehensive spiritual care might include attention to each of the five R=S themes, in light of frequent endorsement of multiple themes, their interrelationships, and the frequency of R=S concerns. Spiritual care interventions focused on a single characteristic of R=S may insufficiently account for the inter-dependence of the R=S themes. Moreover, spiritual care interventions that emphasize practitioner attitudes or techniques (e.g., empathic listening) may be inadequate if they do not also account for the substantive R=S content active in the cancer experience. Future spiritual care models must balance supportive caregiver attitudes with substantive engagement of patients' spiritual resources, struggles, and practices.  ", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "586", "text": "ALCORN ET AL.\nOur study findings can also inform the content of spiritual care interventions for further research. For example, the high frequency of prayer and its interrelationship with the other four themes suggests that prayer may have a key role in spiritual care interventions. Other examples include patients' frequent endorsement of particular beliefs (e.g., beliefs being spiritual but not religious), the relationship of those beliefs to other themes (e.g., the connection of belief in God's will to acceptance of the cancer diagnosis), and tensions related to those beliefs (e.g., questioning God's love or power). Additionally, engaging cancer patients' R=S may commonly involve attending to their unique belief systems, which may require the involvement of individuals with particular training and experience relevant to patients' R=S beliefs. A final example is the endorsement of the R=S community theme, notable in light of data indicating that terminally ill patients with cancer frequently become less engaged with R=S communities as a result of physical limitations. 27 The frequent relationships between the R=S community theme with R=S practices and transformation, along with cancer patients' common perceived need to be better connected to R=S communities, 23 suggest that future models of spiritual care in the medical context should include a central role for patients' R=S communities. This study's limitations include the fact that it is based on a circumscribed definition of R=S in order to clearly distinguish R=S from related, but distinct psychosocial parameters (e.g., social support); hence some aspects of R=S may have been excluded. Second, though patients were randomly sampled and the response rate was high, the study population was from a single U.S. region, largely Judeo-Christian, and Caucasian. Additionally, since qualitative interviews are limited by what participants spontaneously share, theme frequencies may underestimate the true frequency of theme endorsement and subsequent quantitative assessment of subtheme interrelationships may underestimate the frequency of significant relationships between subthemes. Given these limitations of qualitative data and the cross-sectional nature of our study, these analyses were exploratory and hypothesis-generating only.\nBy comprehensively assessing the functioning of R=S in the advanced cancer experience and the attendant spiritual concerns, this study aids in providing an inductively derived framework for the content of spiritual care.

Here we present both the resulting Appropriateness Criteria and the rationale for making these decisions. The treatment recommendations are placed within the larger framework of the role of radiation in palliative care by discussing the efficiency of palliative radiotherapy schedules, cost effectiveness issues, and the need for additional research regarding the proper multidisciplinary care of patients with symptomatic bone metastasis.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "F ew therapeutic guidelines exist for the treatment of metastatic disease because of the complexity of the problem based on type of cancer and site(s) of involvement. The roles of systemic agents (including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, bisphosphonates, and radiopharmaceuticals) and local therapies (including surgery and radiation), alone or in combination, still have not been fully defined. Part of the difficulty in determining the best multidisciplinary approach relates to the various types of clinical problems that require palliative care. Here we present the treatment recommendations derived by the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Radiation Oncology for the treatment of bone metastasis (Tables 1-3).\nThe treatment of bone metastases is one of the most common indications for palliative care, and it represents para-digm for the issues presented. Even among patients with bone metastases, a number of different clinical problems, such as pathologic fracture and spinal cord compression, require different multidisciplinary considerations. Patient factors such as performance status influence decision making. How therapies can be combined to achieve additive or synergistic effects while reducing treatment-related toxicities is an issue that especially needs to be addressed. Like the approach used in curative therapies combining chemotherapy and radiation, studies are needed that evaluate the combination of localized therapies, surgery, and external beam radiation, with systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and bisphosphonates, and radiopharmaceuticals).\nUnder current practice, systemic chemotherapy=hormonal therapy and bisphosphonates are usually administered when bone metastases are first diagnosed except for cases in which pathologic fracture, impending pathologic fracture, or spinal       cord compression is identified. External beam radiotherapy is usually delayed until the metastatic disease progresses, causing significant pain or risk for pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression. Use of radiopharmaceuticals is generally considered in a small fraction of patients with persistent multifocal sites of pain, or recurrence of pain in a previously irradiated site.\nno prior EBRT to femur CTX \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT HT or\nHT \u00fe EBRT or HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT CTX \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT HT\nSur \u00fe EBRT EBRT or HT \u00fe EBRT or HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT or Sur \u00fe CTX \u00fe HT HT \u00fe BP SRP \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT HT\nSur or Sur \u00fe EBRT or Sur \u00fe HT or HT \u00fe EBRT or HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT EBRT or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe EBRT Sur \u00fe CTX \u00fe HT or Sur \u00fe CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP or Sur \u00fe CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe EBRT or Sur \u00fe CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP \u00fe EBRT CTX or HT or CTX \u00fe BP or CTX \u00fe HT \u00fe BP SRP or HT \u00fe BP", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Prognostic Factors", "text": "Even in the most favorable situation for bone metastases, the median survival is 3 years or less. After bone metastases are diagnosed, the median survivals are 25 months with breast cancer, 6 months with prostate cancer, and 3 months with lung cancer. [1][2][3] The distribution of bone metastases, as studied in prostate cancer, has prognostic significance. The rate of survival is significantly longer when then metastases are restricted to the pelvis and lumbar spine, and among patients who respond to salvage hormone therapy. [4][5][6] Any metastatic involvement outside the pelvis and lumbar spine results in lower rates of survival irrespective of response to salvage hormone therapy.\nPain represents a sensitive measure of disease activity. [7][8][9][10][11] Pain was reported to be the presenting symptom in 79% of 108 patients referred to an outpatient multidisciplinary bone metastasis clinic. The time since diagnosis of the primary tumor ranged from 2 weeks to 23 years; the median time since diagnosis was 22 months, and 30% of patients had been diagnosed within the past 6 months. 12 The median age of the population was 55 years, and 69% of the patients were less than 65 years of age. On average, pain was rated as moderate to severe in 79% and severe in 23% of patients; at its worst, pain was rated as severe by 78% and intolerable by 22% of the patients. Only 45% of patients experienced good relief from the prescribed analgesics, and 23% indicated that the prescribed analgesics were ineffective. Despite this, 21% of patients worked full-time and 6% were employed part-time; 13% were homemakers, and only 16% of patients considered themselves to be disabled.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Role of Radiation in Palliative Care", "text": "In the United States, approximately half of patients who receive radiation therapy are treated with palliative intent. The goals of palliation include the relief of symptoms, if present, or the prevention of symptoms that are likely to occur in the future, referred to as prophylactic or prospective palliation. 13 Physicians need to develop treatment plans for patients with metastatic disease so the patients do not spend a disproportionate percentage of their survival time getting antineoplastic treatment. Palliative cancer treatment should be administered over the shortest period of time possible and should provide comfort to the patient with the fewest treatment-related side effects, allowing patients to use their remaining time, which may be more than a year, to attend to important personal matters and goals while they are still able to do so. Ineffective, futile therapies that incur morbidity and cost and provide little to no palliative benefit should not be administered.\nPalliative therapy for cancer has greater prominence as quality-of-life issues have gained recognition within cancer therapy. Systemic therapies, including bisphosphonates, are generally administered without interruption for metastatic disease. But systemic therapies for metastatic disease have limited impact on overall survival. Symptom relief from systemic therapies is variable, and ongoing systemic therapies can cause significant toxicities that can result in hospitalization. Fatigue from uninterrupted therapy and from dealing with the hospital system can often consume the patient's remaining survival time. The current paradigm continuously administers systemic therapy and surgery or radiation therapy is generally used only to treat severe symptoms.\nQuality-of-life issues have driven much of the evolution of radiation therapy. Multidisciplinary approaches that include radiation therapy have allowed organ-sparing surgical approaches in head and neck cancer, sarcomas, and breast cancer. Radiotherapy has long been used to relieve symptoms of metastatic disease in every anatomic site. The efficacy of palliative radiation in symptom relief is well documented, and exceeds that of systemic therapies, which are administered to prevent disease progression. It is important to recognize that approximately 50% of patients will experience relief of pain just 2 weeks after completing palliative external beam radiation for bone metastases, and that more than 75% will have pain relief 4 weeks after completing radiation. [14][15][16] Likewise, systemic radiopharmaceuticals have comparable rates of pain relief, have no visceral toxicity, and are effective in preventing skeletal-related events.\nMore recently, palliative radiotherapy has been underutilized in the United States and in most developed nations in favor of systemic therapies. Although palliation traditionally has represented a large part of radiotherapeutic practice, radiation is generally considered to be an underutilized costeffective treatment in palliative care. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, approximately 25% of all radiation treatments were administered with palliative intent. 17 Since more than half of patients with prostate, breast, and lung cancer will develop symptoms from metastases, palliative radiation therapy is considered to be greatly underutilized because bisphosphonates have not been shown to reduce the need for analgesics to treat pain from symptomatic lesions.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Efficiency of Palliative Radiation Schedules", "text": "A single large radiation fraction has been shown to be as effective in relieving pain as other radiation schedules that have more treatments. In more than 10 prospective randomized trials conducted in Europe, no difference was reported in quickly symptoms resolved or in the duration of pain relief when a single dose of radiation was compared to a radiation schedule with multiple radiation fractions. [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] In each case, symptom relief lasted 3 months in 70% of cases, 6 months in 37%, and 12 months in 20% of cases. As in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study, approximately 69% responded at 4 weeks, and response rates plateaued, totaling 80% at 8 weeks. Complete response rates after a single 8 Gy fraction totaled 15% at 2 weeks, 23% at 4 weeks, 28% at 8 weeks, and 39% at 12 weeks postradiation. Because survival is determined by the location and number of radiation fractions used for a localized area of disease, overall survival rates for a single fraction of radiation are equivalent to those achieved by a course of palliative radiation with multiple fractions.\nAn RTOG prospective randomized trial consisted of 949 patients with breast and prostate cancer comparing 30 Gy in 10 fractions to a single 8 Gy fraction for bone metastases. The THERAPEUTIC GUIDELINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF BONE METASTASIS pretreatment characteristics of the 847 analyzable patients were equally balanced between treatment arms. They included 56% having a weight-bearing painful site, 72% having severe pain, 27% who were receiving bisphosphonates, and 57% with a solitary painful site. Acute toxicity was mild, with a total of only 2 patients experiencing a grade 4 toxicity and 24 with a grade 3 toxicity. 14 But the 30 Gy arm had significantly more grade 2 to grade 4 toxicity, 17% versus 10%. Median survival was 9 months with 41% of patients alive at 1 year. No difference was observed in pain relief at 3 months. The rates of complete pain relief (CR) and partial pain relief (PR) were 15% and 50%, respectively, for the 8 Gy arm, and 18% and 48%, respectively, for the 30 Gy arm. At 3 months, one third of patients no longer required analgesics.\nA shorter radiation schedule, like a single fraction, is advantageous for patients with poor prognostic factors. First, it is easier for patients with a poor Karnofsky Performance Scale to complete therapy. Second, response and survival rates are equal for single and multifraction therapy at 3 months because median survival is less than 6 months among patients with poor prognostic factors and average around 24 months among patients with metastatic disease. 18,21,25,[29][30][31] This is an important consideration when the number of weeks of survival is evaluated relative to the number of weeks receiving palliative treatment. Third, the option of retreatment after a single fraction of radiation may also provide an advantage among patients with good prognostic factors as a means to periodically reduce tumor burden and control symptoms in noncritical anatomic sites. Fourth, a single fraction of radiation is more cost effective. The cost of radiation therapy is reduced by 41% with the use of a single fraction compared to a 10-fraction course of palliative radiation. The cost of radiation therapy is less expensive than the continued cost of analgesics, and an analysis of a Dutch prospective study showed cost benefit for a single-fraction of radiation compared to multiple radiation fractions, even when retreatment was included in the single-fraction arm. 18,26,30 The RTOG 14 clinical trial has been completed, yet there is little change in clinical practice in radiation oncology with regard to fractionation schedules used for palliative radiation, especially of sites outside the vertebral axis. The argument that American radiation oncologists lack experience in administering a single fraction of radiation is not appropriate since radiation oncologists have sought training and have introduced highly technical advancements, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy, into their practices. Additionally, practices have introduced multimodality therapeutic approaches based on survival benefits, such as chemoradiation for cervical cancer, from clinical trials with far fewer patient numbers. Based on multiple prospective randomized clinical trials conducted by cooperative groups both in Europe and the United States, a single fraction of radiation is appropriate for nonvertebral metastases. More prolonged radiation schedules and more complex radiation treatment planning may be appropriate for vertebral metastases to reduce toxicity to adjacent structures as the larynx, esophagus, and stomach.", "n_publication_ref": 25, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Radiopharmaceuticals", "text": "High rates of pain control have also been achieved with radiopharmaceuticals. 14,[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42] Given as a convenient single intravenous administration on an outpatient basis, (another systemic treatment for multifocal bone metastases), radiopharmaceuticals also have a response time of about 2 to 4 weeks, with effective palliation of pain lasting more than 6 months in 60% to 80% of patients with breast and prostate cancers. The half-life of strontium 89 in normal bone is approximately 14 days, and in the diseased bone it is 51 days.

Surgery should also be considered if the diagnosis is in doubt, if stabilization is necessary or if radiotherapy has already been given to the same area.\nSpine metastases cause significant pain and can result in irreversible paralysis. Patients with known vertebral metastases require frequent clinical evaluation to identify any change in symptoms and=or radiographic findings suggesting risk for spinal cord compromise. Early detection of vertebral compromise is paramount to preventing an oncologic emergency with severe pain and neurologic compromise from spinal cord compression. Emergent oncologic care involves steroids and either surgical decompression or radiation therapy.

Pain scores decreased about 4 points (0 to 10 scale) after radiotherapy from a median level of 5.58 before radiation to 1.55 after treatment. 43 Likewise, incident-related pain with movement decreased 5 points from 7.32 before treatment to 1.94 after treatment. The estimated cost of radiotherapy ranged from $1,200 to $2,500 per patient. With durable pain relief for 9 months, the estimated cost of analgesics over the same time period would have totaled $9,000 to $36,000.

However, studies should define clear indications and the specific benefit to the patient. Trials should determine when to start and stop the therapy, and the appropriate patient populations to receive the therapy. Toxicities, such as renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw with bisphosphonates, need to be clearly evaluated relative to those of other therapeutic modalities and overall survival. Cost-utility analyses need to be performed for palliative care endpoints that include efficacy, efficiency, and functional outcomes compared to other available therapies. Clinical trials that include these criteria are critical to future practice guidelines development.\nThe key question is not what can be done, but what should be done. In summary, more may not be best for the patient. It is recognized that health acre professionals are facing tremendous conflicting pressures in clinical practice. Among these pressures are often unrealistic expectations for outcomes demanded by an Internet-savvy public, changing rules, and declining reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient care from Medicare and other payers, pressures to see more patients with a declining workforce, and litigation. While warnings regarding a crisis in American health care have been discussed for almost two decades, the time clock is running out. The demographics in America are not amenable to a short-term fix, since the baby-boomer population is beginning to reach retirement age. Currently, more than two thirds of the federal budget is designated for entitlements, leaving little ability to increase further spending on health care, which now already consumes over 15% of the American gross domestic product. 44 The treatment of bone metastases represents a paradigm for evaluating palliative care in terms of symptom relief, toxicities of therapy, and the financial burden to the patient, caregivers, and society. Despite enormous expenditures to treat metastases, overall survival rates have not changed significantly, patients continue to suffer symptoms of the disease, and aggressive therapeutic approaches often are pursued throughout the course of metastatic disease that incur toxicity in approximately 25% of patients. This approach is inconsistent with the goals of palliative care, which should efficiently provide comfort, using antineoplastic therapies and=or supportive care with the fewest treatment-related side effects, recognizing that the patient will die from the disease.

Discussing prognosis is one of the more challenging aspects of this communication. 7 The ability to estimate prognosis is key to the timing of the communication. A failure to estimate prognosis may lead to a delay in communication and in identifying the patient's values and wishes for subsequent treatment, which may include a preference for palliative care and hospice referral rather than continued aggressive therapy.\nStudies of physicians' estimates of survival in patients with cancer have consistently shown that they overestimate survival. 8,9 Researchers are seeking to improve prognostic accuracy for patients with cancer by developing an integrated prognostic model that combines clinical predictions and prognostic factors such as functional status, nutritional status, and comorbidities. 10,11 The surprise question is one such clinical prediction tool that has been validated as part of an integrated prognostic model for dialysis patients, 5 but it has not previously been tested in patients with cancer. 12 The Gold Standards Framework in their Prognostic Indicator Guidance recommended the surprise question as a trigger to encourage  better prediction of patients who might benefit from palliative care, including discussions about end-of-life care. 13 In multivariate analysis in this study, a ''No'' response to the surprise question identified patients with cancer who had a seven times greater hazard of death in the next year compared to patients in the ''Yes'' group. By countering the tendency of physicians to overestimate prognosis, the surprise question incorporated into an integrated prognostic model offers the potential of improving physicians' prognostic accuracy.\nThe surprise question may improve prognostic accuracy because it requires physicians to frame prognosis in a broader perspective and allows physicians to think in a new way about their patients. Physicians do not need to definitely conclude from the question that a patient is dying. The question forces them to consider whether the patient might be dying. It is an intuitive tool. It is also a feasible tool. In this study busy cancer center oncologists classified 97% of consecutive patients. In this study the positive predictive value of the surprise question was not high, but positive predictive value calculations are known to be dependent on factor prevalence and the 1-year mortality in this cancer population was only 8.3%. The sensitivity of 75% does not negate the fact that the surprise question is a simple screening test to use to determine if treatment for particular patients with cancer should include advance care planning and other palliative care interventions. Furthermore, as noted above it is not proposed that the surprise question be used alone to estimate prognosis.\nThere are several limitations to this study. The sample was limited to one population of patients with cancer being treated by four academic oncologists in West Virginia, and the majority of the patients had breast cancer. Second the study patient population was not ethnically diverse and thus the results may not be generalizable. Third, because this was preliminary research to determine the feasibility and outcomes of the surprise question in cancer, other prognostic factors such as functional and nutritional status were not collected. Fourth, no specific intervention was undertaken as a result of a ''No'' classification. Although patients classified as ''No'' were significantly more likely to have completed an advance directive, outcomes such as hospice referrals were not tracked. Because of these multiple limitations, although the findings with regard to the greatly increased hazard of death in the ''No'' patients are robust, they need to be considered tentative.\nTaken together, our findings show that the surprise question is a simple, feasible, and effective tool to identify patients with cancer with a greatly increased risk of 1-year mortality. Further research is necessary to determine if use of the surprise question in an integrated prognostic model for patients with cancer improves prognostic accuracy and if earlier identification of patients with cancer with poor prognoses using the surprise question leads to improved patient care outcomes.", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors thank Cynthia McMillen for assistance with data collection and analysis and manuscript preparation.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Relationship between cancer patients' predictions of prognosis and their treatment preferences", "journal": "JAMA", "year": "1998", "authors": "J C Weeks; E F Cook; S J O'day; L M Peterson; N Wenger; D Reding"}, {"title": "Why do patients choose chemotherapy near the end of life?

Palliative care improves the quality of hospital care for patients with advanced disease. Less is known about its effects on hospital costs. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between palliative care consultation and hospital costs in patients with advanced disease. Design, setting, and patients: An observational study of 3321 veterans hospitalized with advanced disease between October 1, 2004 and September 30, 2006. The sample includes 606 (18%) veterans who received palliative care and 2715 (82%) who received usual hospital care. October 1, 2004 and September 30, 2006. Main outcome measures: We studied the costs and intensive care unit (ICU) use of palliative versus usual care for patients in five Veterans Affairs hospitals over a 2-year period. We used an instrumental variable approach to control for unmeasured characteristics that affect both treatment and outcome. Results: The average daily total direct hospital costs were $464 a day lower for the 606 patients receiving palliative compared to the 2715 receiving usual care ( p < 0.001). Palliative care patients were 43.7 percentage points less likely to be admitted to ICU during the hospitalization than usual care patients ( p < 0.001).

Elderly veterans incur an average of $43,795 in Medi-care and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) costs combined in the last year of life. 6 Most of the spending is for hospital care, with a substantial portion going for care in the intensive care unit (ICU). 7,8 Concerns about the quality and costs of care for patients with life-limiting diseases are particularly significant for the VA health care system, the largest, integrated health care system in the nation. VA will be caring for an increasing proportion of veterans with life-limiting conditions as Vietnam-era veterans age and younger veterans with combat-related disabilities return from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nHospital-based palliative care programs, focused on pain and symptom management, communication and goals of care, and assistance with transitions among sites of care, have become an increasingly common way to improve hospital care for patients with advanced disease and their families. 9,10 Over 50% of hospitals with 50 or more beds have palliative care programs as do most VA hospitals. 9 Studies suggest palliative care consultation can improve patient symptom management and increase family satisfaction with care 3,[11][12][13][14] and may reduce costs. [15][16][17][18][19][20][21] This study builds on and amplifies prior studies, including our own smaller study 15 by using a relatively large sample of 3321 veterans admitted with advanced disease to five VA medical centers and comparing costs for those receiving palliative and usual care. It addresses limitations of prior studies by using an instrumental variable approach to account for the selection into treatment on unmeasured patient characteristics. [22][23][24] We compared average direct hospital costs for patients admitted with advanced disease who were referred for palliative care consultation with advanced disease patients not referred for palliative care consultation. We also examined the relationship between palliative care consultation and ICU admission because ICU costs are approximately 20% of overall hospital costs. 25 The findings from this study are relevant to current efforts by VA to expand palliative care services.", "n_publication_ref": 30, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study population", "text": "We conducted a retrospective, observational cost analysis using a VA (payer) perspective.

The key independent variable was a binary indicator for whether the hospitalization included a palliative care consultation. Subsequent hospitalizations were classified as palliative care for these patients. All palliative care teams in all inpatient VHA facilities in VISN 3 use a standardized consultation note in the electronic medical record. This was the source for the treatment indicators.\nOther predictors measured demographic characteristics and current health status of the subjects. These measures included the primary disease (HIV/AIDs, advanced cancer, CHF, COPD), age, race/ethnicity, principal admitting diagnosis, hospital death, comorbidities, economic status, LOS, and site. Comorbidities were measured using the Elixhauser index, 33 an algorithm that includes 30 categories of comorbid illness identified by secondary diagnosis codes and discharge diagnosis-related group (DRG). Income status was measured using VA enrollment priority group that measures low income and higher levels of veteran disability. The natural log of the LOS was included because costs tend to be higher early in the stay. Because we were concerned about possible endogeneity for LOS, we conducted the analyses with and without LOS in the models.

The nature and direction of the selection for palliative care is that we expect the sickest patients (based on unmeasured risk factors) to be more likely to be offered palliative care. Physician preferences for offering palliative care can be the source of valid instrumental variables if patients are randomly assigned to physicians, as is effectively the case in the VA. 37 Thus, we used indicators for the attending physicians as the instruments for patient selection into palliative care. We assumed that physicians vary in their preference for palliative care and a patient who would be referred to palliative care by some physicians would not be referred by others. Moreover, if physician tendency to refer patients is to be a valid instrument, then it must be exogenous. It should influence costs of hospital care only through the treatment choice,\nor more specifically, it should not be correlated with unmeasured characteristics in the patient's outcome (cost or ICU stay) equation. Because attending physicians were assigned to patients quasi-randomly (they were assigned on a rotational basis) in the hospitals in our study, physician characteristics are orthogonal to patient characteristics such as unmeasured health status. Thus, we exploited this quasi-experimental nature of the process of physician assignment to patient process to obtain a valid instrument. We expected it to substantially increase the reduction in utilization resulting from palliative care. We included one indicator variable for each attending doctor with 10 or more patients. Doctors who saw less than 10 patients were grouped together in the reference category. We used gamma instrumental variable regressions to estimate treatment effects on health care costs [38][39][40] and bivariate probit models to estimate treatment effects on ICU stays. 41 ", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 3321 veterans in the sample, 606 (18%) who received palliative care and 2715 (82%) who received usual hospital care. Palliative care patients were older, more likely to die during the study, and had more hospitalizations during the study period compared to usual care.\nThe bottom portion of Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 6595 hospitalizations of the 3321 veterans. Palliative care patients averaged approximately 2.2 hospitalizations over the study period compared to 2.0 for usual care patients ( p \u00bc 0.004). We did not find any differences in the results when we restricted the analysis to the first hospitalization for all patients. Hospital and ICU LOS stay were significantly longer for palliative care patients compared to usual care but a significantly smaller proportion of palliative care hospitalizations included an ICU stay.\nThe results from the unadjusted, standard regression analyses with covariate adjustment and instrumental variables analyses are shown in Figure 1. Both the standard and instrumental variables models controlled for advanced disease conditions, age, whether the patient was married, race, whether the subject was Hispanic, principal diagnosis for the stay (infection, cancer, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary), comorbidities, death before end of the study period, days between discharge and death, enrollment priority group, hospital and ICU LOS and site. Adjusted costs for hospitalizations for palliative care patients with advanced disease were significantly lower than costs for hospitalizations for usual care patients with advanced disease.

Our findings are consistent with a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing that patients with life-limiting illness randomized to an inpatient palliative care service had fewer ICU admissions on readmissions and lower costs compared to patients randomized to usual hospital care. 42 Our results also fit with a large multicenter observational study by Morrison and colleagues 43 demonstrating significantly lower overall hospital, ICU, and laboratory costs for patients receiving palliative care consultation compared to propensity score matched usual care patients. This is the first study of palliative care costs to use an instrumental variables approach. Instrumental variable methods are becoming increasingly useful to answer health services questions not amenable to randomized controlled trials to account for unmeasured selection into treatment bias. Such biases in observational studies can be substantial and instrumental variable methods are better than standard analyses. 23 Thus, our finding of cost savings lends additional credibility to similar findings in the literature that did not account for unmeasured selection. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect on cost savings from our study is likely to be more accurate.\nThe impact of differences in the separate effects of the covariate adjustment and the selection adjustment are informative. Because palliative care may lead to use of more pain and other palliative medications, the covariate adjustment for pharmacy costs is higher then the unadjusted average. In contrast, radiology costs were not impacted by selection and the covariate adjustment captures the entire difference. The results for all the other measured factors were the same. Covariate adjustment had no effect while the selection effect was large, significant, and negative, as we initially hypothesized.\nWe think it likely that palliative care consultation during an inpatient stay for advanced disease influences costs, in part, through the focus of palliative care providers on meeting with patients and/or families and the medical team to establish goals of care and treatments that are concordant with the goals, including lower intensity treatments. Indirect evidence for this is the lower laboratory and radiologic testing and decreased use of the ICU for patients receiving palliative care consultation. This is consistent with a recent study of the clinical and economic impact of palliative care consultation reporting that 88% of 304 referrals were for ''end-of-life decision-making.'' 44 Some of the decisions made by these patients/families and the palliative and primary care teams included lower intensity treatment, discharge home for 35% and to home-based or nursing home hospice for 27% of patients. 44 Palliative care consultation teams work with patients/families to establish treatment goals and review currents treatments with those goals in mind. This frequently leads to decisions to discontinue treatments or tests that do not meet the newly established goals. 43 The study has several limitations. The data are not derived from an RCT and thus, the results may be due to unmeasured differences between the groups not captured by the instrumental variable approach. However, we established advanced disease criteria to obtain our sample so that patients would have specific advanced diseases appropriate for palliative care. Most importantly, we used instrumental variable estimation and the model to address selection bias performed well. Finally, our data are from a VA network with a wellorganized palliative care program with relatively consistent operating parameters. Thus, the results may not generalize to newly established palliative care teams and/or less organized palliative care programs. Intervention studies may need to be conducted to test how sensitive these results are to the methods and sustainability of palliative care introduction.\nIn conclusion, this study adds to prior research on the benefits of palliative care consultation by showing that palliative care is associated with substantial reductions in hospital costs of patients with serious, life-limiting illness, a growing 976 PENROD ET AL.\nFIG. 1.

Overall, our understanding of breathlessness in advanced disease is still limited and little is known about the broader palliative care context of breathless patients.\nMost evidence and experience in symptom management and palliative care derives from patients with advanced cancer but it has been widely acknowledged that palliative care should be offered beyond cancer to patients with advanced chronic respiratory disease. [3][4][5] However, the best models and timing for palliative care in COPD have yet to be defined and models for patients with cancer can only serve as examples. There is some evidence that patients with more severe COPD have high palliative care needs, suffer on average from 7 to 11 symptoms, and have concerns about symptom relief, quality of life, satisfaction with care, information, and use of care facilities. [6][7][8][9][10] Given that cancer models of palliative care are much better developed than COPD models, comparing the palliative care needs of patients with severe COPD with those suffering from advanced cancer could help to better plan palliative care for COPD patients but only few studies have compared these two groups 6,[11][12][13] The main focus of these studies was either quality of life and need for social and medical care 11 or patients' preferences for care and life sustaining interventions. 13 Only Edmonds et al. 6 described the detail of symptoms and palliative care needs but used proxy ratings rather than patient reported outcomes. With the exception of Edmonds' study 6 none of the studies reported survival, so that symptom burden can be described in relation to time of death.\nThe study reported here is part of a wider study to describe and compare the course of breathlessness over time and towards the end of life in patients with advanced cancer and COPD. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the symptom burden, palliative care needs, and survival of breathless patients suffering from severe COPD or advanced cancer.", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Patients and Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Setting, patients, and recruitment", "text": "We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients with severe COPD and advanced cancer.

The prevalence and distress of individual physical symptoms was high and rather similar in patients with COPD and in patients with cancer. Therefore, our results seem to suggest that breathless patients experience a particularly high symptom burden, irrespective of whether the breathlessness is due to cancer or COPD.\nPalliative care needs have been evaluated in patients with advanced cancer 23;26 and COPD 8 but despite the value of comparisons in understanding how models of care may be transferable or not comparatively little is known about the comparison of these two groups. Only two studies contrasted patients with COPD and patients with lung cancer and found that patients with chronic lung disease have worse activities of daily living and physical, social, and emotional functioning whilst having less support from a district or palliative nurse. 6,11 Patients lacked information regarding prognosis and future management. The study reported here is the first using a specific palliative care measure, the POS, in patients with COPD. These data highlight patients' concerns about the anxieties of their families. This was the main concern for patients with cancer and the second for patients with COPD. This worry is particularly important as patients with chronic disease (including respiratory disease and cancer) identify family and friends as their main source of support in providing physical and emotional care. 27,28 ", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Clinical and service implications", "text": "This study has several implications for the care of breathless patients both for clinicians and service providers. As many patients with breathlessness are seen by generalist clinicians rather than palliative care specialists, education and skill development with regard to palliative care has to be emphasized for all clinicians. Hence, the presence of breathlessness in patients with cancer and patients with COPD could be a useful trigger for full assessment of symptoms and palliative care needs or may be valuable to trigger referral to palliative care. Clinicians should actively assess and manage other physical and psychological symptoms if a patient presents with breathlessness as the dominant symptom. However, even the presence of breathlessness may not be taken for granted as this symptom has been described as invisible even in patients with severe COPD. 29 Additional symptoms may be highly prevalent and distressing and add considerably to patients' suffering. Special attention should be paid to screening for depression and anxiety. Therefore, systematic assessment using a generic symptom assessment tool such as the MSAS-SF can reveal considerable symptom burden. 30 Regular symptom assessment is paramount in hospice and palliative care services but should also be integrated in respiratory medicine as it has been proposed for other areas such as renal medicine. 30 Data from this study underpin the need for palliative care models for patients with advanced COPD. COPD can serve as a model for palliative care needs for other long-term organ failure conditions. As symptom burden and palliative care needs in patients with severe COPD seem to be very similar to patients with cancer, lessons can be learned from the palliative care model for patients with cancer such as the need for symptom control, attention to psychosocial issues, and advance care planning. However, as symptom burden and palliative care needs were documented well before the end of life of patients with COPD, timing of palliative care may be very different from patients with cancer and more difficult to determine; there is more uncertainty in predicting prognosis for patients with COPD. 4 Late referral of a patient in the last weeks of life will not meet the patients' and families' needs sufficiently. Therefore palliative rather than only end-of-life care is needed for these patients. 4 Palliative care models might be more appropriate as short and early palliative interventions rather than ongoing care over a long time. This might be similar to the short-term palliative care service tested among people with progressive multiple sclerosis. 31 Also, joint respiratory and palliative care services may be an option to provide better palliative care to these patients. Besides the question how and when palliative care services are best introduced to patients with COPD, there are some practical implications for respiratory physicians. The systematic screening for problems using tools such as the POS would be helpful to identify patients' needs. There are educational implications also. More efforts are necessary to train and educate professionals working in the respiratory field to deliver holistic care and better symptom control, especially in the advanced stages of patients' illness. This may be aided by the development of clinical guidelines. Equally palliative care physicians may need to learn more about how to manage patients with long-term conditions. Working in a multidisciplinary team and developing links to specialist services (e.g., palliative care, psychology) can be a first step toward this.\nAs patients with COPD experienced high symptom burden and palliative care needs long before death future research needs to follow-up these patients until death to determine FIG. 3.

religion, spirituality, or life philosophy is not empirically well described. Methods: Participants were parents of children who had enrolled in a prospective cohort study on parental decision-making for children receiving pediatric palliative care. Sixty-four (88%) of the 73 parents interviewed were asked an open-ended question on how religion, spirituality, or life philosophy (RSLP) was helpful in difficult times. Responses were coded and thematically organized utilizing qualitative data analysis methods. Any discrepancies amongst coders regarding codes or themes were resolved through discussion that reached consensus. Results: Most parents of children receiving palliative care felt that RSLP was important in helping them deal with tough times, and most parents reported either participation in formal religious communities, or a sense of personal spirituality. A minority of parents, however, did not wish to discuss the topic at all. For those who described their RSLP, their beliefs and practices were associated with qualities of their overall outlook on life, questions of goodness and human capacity, or that ''everything happens for a reason.'' RSLP was also important in defining the child's value and beliefs about the child's afterlife. Prayer and reading the bible were important spiritual practices in this population, and parents felt that these practices influenced their perspectives on the medical circumstances and decision-making, and their locus of control. From religious participation and practices, parents felt they received support from both their spiritual communities and from God, peace and comfort, and moral guidance. Some parents, however, also reported questioning their faith, feelings of anger and blame towards God, and rejecting religious beliefs or communities.

Further-more, only a handful of published papers, 3,[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] chapters, [14][15][16][17] and books [18][19][20] address, in a focused manner, religion and spirituality in the setting of serious childhood illness and pediatric palliative care.

Within an overall outlook, parents frequently associated RSLP with the quality of goodness. As one parent said, ''God is always good.'' Another parent said, ''I just believe in God and I try and find the good in things.'' Additionally, some parents described their children's presence in the world as a gift. For example, one parent said, ''Every day is a gift, because she was only given three days [to live]. So every other day with her is a gift.'' Human capacity. Certain phrases used by parents spoke to their sense of human capacity, or how a given parent expected to function in the situation. For example, one parent said, ''We're not given more than we can handle.'' Another parent summed up her experience as, ''One day at a time, one step at a time, one mile at a time.'' Everything happens for a reason. One of the statements that parents used most often was that ''Everything happens for a reason.'' Parents seemed to identify their religion with that statement. For example, one parent said, ''I do believe in that higher faith, so I believe that there was a reason why [our child] was put here, given to us.''

Another parent stressed that, because Jesus always paid attention to children, all children, including her child, were important. As she noted, ''It would be wrong for me to just say that, well, her life isn't really important. You know, she is not as important as some of the other kids because she's disabled and she would be much happier in a different place. That's not true because, in my Bible, anyway, every person is important to God, equally important.''

And so I say that she's brought down here to bring all these people together and to show [them] something.'' Belief in afterlife. Parents used many different words to describe life for their children after their deaths, including ''afterlife,'' ''a life after this life,'' ''golden gate,'' ''a better place,'' ''a happy place,'' and ''heaven.'' Belief in an afterlife was ''reassuring,'' providing ''peace'' and ''acceptance,'' and helped parents to be ''not afraid'' of their children's deaths and ''trust in God to take care of [our child].''

Many articles regarding religious affiliation have focused narrowly on a religion's prescriptive teachings about death and dying (for adults and for children), based on various authors' reviews of religious texts. 22,23 When studies actually examine the relationship for a given individual between stated affiliation and actual beliefs and practices, considerable variation is evident. 8,24 Our findings suggest that, while most parents identify with a formal religion, some parents identify more with a sense of spirituality, and other parents either do not identify in such ways or do not wish to discuss the matter.\nStudies of religiosity have attempted to measure the level of intensity of religious and spiritual beliefs and practices by asking questions about church attendance, prayer, and other religious behaviors. These studies fail to find a constant direction of association between behaviors and either mental health 25 or decision making. 26 Our findings suggest that, while specific religious practices are important to families, these may not be associated with end-of-life care beliefs or behaviors. Instead, parents in this study reported that practices such as prayer and Bible study gave them a more general sense of peace and calm.\nStudies of religious coping, which consider how religious beliefs and behaviors inform a stressful life situation, have more successfully identified associations between religious coping and mental health over time in many diverse populations, including medically ill elderly people, 27 patients with HIV/AIDS, 28 and women with breast cancer. 29 Furthermore, in a population of adult patients with advanced cancer, religious coping has been associated with the receipt of intensive life-prolonging care near death. 30 In two small studies of parents of children with cancer, parents reported strong religious beliefs and increased religious behaviors following their children's diagnosis, and the positive influence of religious beliefs on coping behaviors. 9,13 Most investigations of religious coping in parents of critically ill children, however, have studied bereaved parents, who report that spirituality guided them in end-of-life decision making and provided emotional substance, [31][32][33] but these studies are subject to retrospective recall bias. Nevertheless, our findings, gathered from parents whose children had life-threatening illnesses but had not died, support the association between religion and coping.\nThis study confirms both the diversity and the importance of the role that RSLP plays in the lives of most, but not all, parents whose children are receiving pediatric palliative care. The study's chief limitation was that the restriction to Englishspeaking families who were willing to receive palliative care consults in a single pediatric hospital, and participate in the study, excluded both patients from a wider geographic and cultural area and those who were unwilling to participate in palliative care for their children. This is likely to have narrowed the range of parental beliefs and practices reported. Clearly, further research is warranted to identify the interrelationships between RSLP coping in parents of children receiving pediatric palliative care with other areas of support and influence, and attention to possible multilevel mechanisms between the family and larger socioeconomic and cultural structures.\nFurther research is also warranted to understand parents' frequent use of aphorisms that perhaps may function as heuristics or ''rules of thumb'' 34 to explain their RSLP and allow parents to make effective decisions with a minimum of time, knowledge, and cognitive effort. While such phrases may appear clich\u00e9d or superficial, the importance of the words people use when framing both their understanding of a situation, and their actions within a situational framework, should not be overlooked. 35 We hope that this study, documenting a RSLP catalog of common concerns expressed by this group of parents, assists clinicians in approaching similar families with an informed but minimalist agenda: namely, to gently explore the religion and spirituality resources and needs of patients and families; to effectively facilitate the coordination of appropriate supports and services; and to be fully present and engaged during their journey.", "n_publication_ref": 17, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "The study was funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NR010026).\nThe funding organization had no role in the design of the study beyond the critique offered by the peer-review process and had no role in the conduct of the study, including the collection, analysis, and preparation of the data or the drafting, editing, review, or approval of the manuscript.\nAll authors participated in the design of the study and interpretation of the data; all authors performed the data analysis; Kari Hexem and Chris Feudtner drafted sections of the manuscript; all authors revised the manuscript for key intellectual content.

The consensus panel developed primary and secondary criteria for two checklists-one to use for screening at the time of admission and one for daily patient rounds.

The new physician, nursing, and social worker specialties and certification processes of hospice and palliative medicine have emerged to help meet these needs. Although there has been enormous expansion of hospital palliative care programs, not all hospitals have palliative care teams, and workforce shortages combined with tenuous funding may limit the spread and sustainability of existing programs. [1][2] The most prevalent model of palliative care service delivery in acute care hospitals is the consultation service, designed to provide specialty (aka, secondary or tertiary) level care for difficult-to-manage symptoms, complex family dynamics, and challenging care decisions regarding the use of life-sustaining treatments (Table 1, sidebar). [3][4][5][6][7][8] Ideally, day-to-day care for seriously ill patients would be managed through basic (aka, primary) palliative care services, provided by attending physicians, nursing staff, social workers, chaplains, and other professionals involved with routine patient care. It is neither sustainable nor desirable that palliative care specialists manage all the palliative care needs of all seriously ill patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve basic palliative care assessment and treatment skills among clinicians caring for seriously ill patients, with a goal of reserving specialty-level palliative care services for problems beyond their capabilities.\nAlthough the need for better basic palliative care skills is recognized, education alone is unlikely to substantially change practice patterns. [9][10] Ideally, education would be one component of a more comprehensive systems-change approach. 11 Systems-change approaches work to address complex problems by combining evidence-based assessment and treatment algorithms, checklists of key tasks, quality improvement initiatives, provider and patient education, and other systematic processes geared to reducing variation in care. The use of checklists in hospitals is gaining acceptance; data indicate that the rigorous use of checklists can lead to quality outcomes, such as reductions in infections and improved clinical team communication. [12][13][14][15] Palliative care programs are experimenting with checklists as a means of identifying patients most in need of a specialty-level consultation (16). In this approach, a consideration for consultation is initiated based on disease (metastatic cancer), patient (severe pain), or family (difficulty coping) variables, rather than using variable thresholds for initiating a consultation among attending physicians.\nThe staff and consultants of the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) have recognized the gap between what palliative care teams can provide and the needs of the larger pool of hospitalized patients with palliative care needs. As a first step to identify patients in this gap, and with the goal of working toward systems-based change, CAPC convened a consensus panel in 2010 to address the following question: What criteria should be used for hospitals to conduct prospective casefinding, via a checklist, for patients with unmet palliative care needs?\nThe consensus panel included representation from a range of professional disciplines and from academic, Veterans Health Administration, and community hospital settings; single hospitals and large health systems; adult and pediatric programs; and palliative care programs coordinated by both hospice agencies and hospitals (Appendix). Previous work by this panel has included consensus recommendations for operational, clinical, and customer metrics for palliative care inpatient units and consultation services, as well as operational standards for hospital palliative care programs.

Routine palliative care problems should be managed by health professionals involved in day-to-day care of patients in the same manner that routine cardiac problems are handled by primary care physicians, rather than cardiologists. Every hospital (acute care, long-term acute care, specialty) should develop a systematic approach to ensure that patients at high risk for unmet palliative care needs are identified and served in a timely manner. Hospitals should develop a systematic approach to ensure that, upon admission and daily throughout the hospitalization, identified patients undergo a screening palliative care assessment by health professionals providing day-to-day care (Table 2).

Since not all hospitals have pediatricians or pediatric palliative care specialists available, adult clinicians may be called upon to provide palliative care for children and their families. 21 Thus, while recognizing that many clinical care issues are different between adult and pediatric patients, the panel decided to develop a single master list of indicators suitable for both populations.\nThe starting point for all criteria chosen was the identification of patients with a potentially life-limiting or life-threatening condition (Table 1). The panel recognized that this term represents a broad construct that is open to variable interpretation. However, the panel believed that, to capture the spectrum of palliative care unmet needs, the defining term should be as inclusive as possible.\nEach checklist is divided into primary and secondary criteria to facilitate ease of implementation. Primary criteria are limited to the five most-important indicators identified by the consensus panel. They are global in nature (e.g., weight loss) and are to be used as the minimum expected standard of care. Secondary criteria are more specific (e.g., waiting for LVAD placement) and are designed to be used as supplementary criteria for hospitals that have the ability to implement more-comprehensive systems of patient identification using a longer list of criteria.\nSelection of indicators was based on national standards (e.g., National Quality Forum), research findings (e.g., hip fracture, dementia), and expert opinion from the consensus panel. Supporting references are provided for criteria, based on national standards or research findings, in which the citation directly recommends palliative care assessment or where a strong inference can be made from research data that a palliative care assessment is warranted. Of note is that criteria were identified to trigger a basic palliative care assessment by the primary treatment team, not as a trigger for additional specialty-level palliative care consultations, although they could be applied for that purpose. Many of the identified criteria also apply to and are easily adapted for use in long-term care, office, or home-care settings.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The panel recognizes that not all clinicians are competent to complete a basic palliative care assessment, or to respond effectively to palliative care needs once such needs are identified. Application of a systems-based approach to patient identification proposed here, combined with complementary educational initiatives tied to credentialling processes, will help improve clinicians' knowledge and skills in basic palliative care. Provider and staff education and checklist implementation are inseparable; both are required to increase access to palliative care services.\nAs with all quality improvement efforts, attitudinal and logistical barriers to implementation will be significant. In particular, we expect that some clinicians will question the perceived value of palliative care assessments and resist the burden of adopting a new clinical checklist. Health care professionals are urged to review the methods by which others have successfully implemented checklists into routine care. [12][13][14][15] The development and spread of specialty-level palliative care programs in hospitals over the past 10 years has been heartening, outstripping the capacity of many teams to meet the demand for their services. Palliative care clinical competencies are basic skills for all clinical staff, hence the need to better equip health professionals to provide standardized and evidence-based primary palliative care services, reserving specialists for truly difficult problems. A first step in this process is to develop standards for identifying patients at risk for unmet palliative care needs.\nThe criteria identified in this report should be viewed as a starting point for discussion within hospitals: Are these the right criteria for our patient population? What workflow and medical record systems can efficiently support optimal and routine patient identification? How will we support all clinicians in providing basic palliative care services? How will palliative care be made part of the hospital culture across settings of care? How do we decide, in a timely way, which patients need specialty-level palliative care services, and then ensure that they receive those services?

We describe a clinical practice of early palliative care consultation that improved quality of life, mood, and survival in a randomized clinical trial. Methods: As part of a randomized trial of early palliative care versus standard care in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed documentation of the components of the initial palliative care consultation, self-reported quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Trial Outcome Index (FACT-L TOI), and mood as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: Seven palliative care clinicians provided consultation to 67 patients. The median total time spent with patients for the initial visit was 55 minutes (range, 20-120). Consultations focused on symptom management (median, 20 minutes; range, 0-75), patient and family coping (median, 15 minutes; range, 0-78), and illness understanding and education (median, 10 minutes; range, 0-35). Lower quality of life as measured by the FACT-L TOI predicted greater consultation time (odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.99). Additionally, lower quality of life scores on the FACT-L TOI (OR \u00bc 0.93, 95% CI \u00bc 0.88-0.97) and higher depression scores on the PHQ-9 (OR \u00bc 1.15, 95% CI \u00bc 1.02-1.31) predicted greater time spent on symptom management. Conclusions: Initial palliative care consultation near the time of diagnosis in patients with metastatic NSCLC in this intervention is nearly an hour in length and largely addresses symptom management, patient and family coping, and illness understanding and education. Lower quality of life predicted longer consultations, with more time dedicated specifically to symptom management.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "W hile access to inpatient palliative care consultation is standard in many U.S. hospitals, 1 outpatient palliative care services are still under development in many institutions. 2 To improve symptom and disease management as well as to allow sufficient time for patients and families to develop a clear understanding of the prognosis and care goals, referrals to palliative care ideally would occur early in the course of disease and in the outpatient setting. 2 Accumulating data suggest that palliative care in the outpatient setting is not only acceptable, but also beneficial to patients. [3][4][5][6] In related work, we have shown how the early introduction of palliative care in the outpatient setting can improve quality of life, mood, and survival in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 7 Individuals with metastatic NSCLC have a life expectancy of less than 1 year and experience a high symptom burden. 8,9 Specifically, at least 50% of newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC report symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, decreased appetite, weight loss, and unclear thinking. 6 In addition, rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms in this population are high, at 21% and 31%, respectively. 6,10 In light of their physical and psychosocial distress and poor prognosis, patients with metastatic NSCLC are an appropriate population in whom to study the early introduction of palliative care.\nDespite mounting data about the feasibility and benefits of palliative care consultation early in the course of metastatic cancer, 3,[5][6][7] the practice is relatively new and few data exist detailing the nature of these clinical encounters. Because a broad range of services may be provided in routine palliative care consultation including symptom management, 5,6,11 advance care planning, 4 psychological and spiritual support, 12,13 transitions of care and referral to hospice, 14 and coordination of care between providers, 2 we sought to understand which of these services were emphasized in the outpatient setting.\nDetermining the nature of outpatient palliative care services is important to clarify expectations for patients and referring physicians, encourage dissemination of this evolving palliative care practice, and facilitate appropriate scheduling and staffing for outpatient clinics. As part of a randomized clinical trial of early palliative care versus standard oncology care, we sought to describe components of the initial outpatient palliative care consultation for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC. We also sought to understand whether certain patient factors such as quality of life and mood were associated with the length of time or composition of consultation.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Study design", "text": "Outpatients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing early palliative care integrated with standard oncology care versus standard oncology care alone.

However, 1 patient randomized to standard care was erroneously assigned to early palliative care at the time of randomization and was therefore included in the early palliative care arm. Of the 77 patients who received early palliative care, 10 were excluded from the current analysis: 4 were hospitalized before the initial scheduled visit with the palliative care provider and were seen as inpatient consultations, 1 died before palliative care consultation, and 5 completed the initial consultation but had insufficient data for analysis. A total of 67 patients were included in the present analysis: 62 patients had complete data; an additional 5 patients received consultations but had incomplete data as only the total time spent in consultation was documented without specifying time spent on components of care.

Patients randomized to early palliative care within weeks of diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC spent a significant amount of time in consultation and discussed a variety of topics. While palliative care providers spent the largest proportion of time during the first visit discussing symptom management, many patients discussed psychosocial issues, such as coping and illness understanding. Although patients were not referred to palliative care with a specific problem to be addressed, palliative care providers were able to engage patients in a way that allowed for a comprehensive initial assessment.\nAs palliative care develops as a medical specialty, particularly with the recent Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) recognition, it is important to accurately define clinical practice both for educational and research purposes. This study helps to define the practice of palliative care consultation near the time of diagnosis for patients with metastatic cancer. Determining the components of consultation such as symptom management, patient and family coping, and illness understanding and education is useful for (1) understanding patient and family needs, (2) teaching new clinicians how to approach outpatient palliative care, and (3) standardizing practice within an institution, within the field, or for research purposes. Moreover, defining the time required for consultation may assist and guide those developing outpatient clinics in determining clinic schedules and models of compensation that accurately reflect services provided by palliative care.\nDespite consultation near the time of diagnosis, when patients are relatively early in their disease trajectory, the consultation time was largely dedicated to symptom management. This finding is consistent with literature that shows high symptom burden for patients with metastatic NSCLC at diagnosis. 6,10,21 Our data showed that patients with lower quality of life and mood scores required increased total consultation time and increased time spent on symptom management. In addition, symptom assessment might comprise a large portion of the initial palliative care visit because it allows the palliative care practitioner time to build rapport before broaching more difficult topics, such as prognosis and end-oflife decision making. Supporting this hypothesis, our study found that the majority of clinicians deferred discussion about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Table 5 describes our broad recommendations for determining the goals and timing of particular palliative care interventions in the ambulatory care setting. Specifically, we found that an approach that    ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "462", "text": "JACOBSEN ET AL.\nprioritized an initial focus on symptom assessment and treatment useful, and recommend it for palliative care early in the disease trajectory.\nIn addition to symptom management, approximately a third of visit time was spent exploring and supporting patient coping. Results from a pilot study show a trend towards less anxiety and depression, and improved functional status and end-of-life preparation in patients who engage in discussions that explore the psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of the illness experience. 13 Psychoeducational support has also been shown to improve quality of life and mood in patients with advanced cancer. 22 Psychological support services can be particularly helpful for those patients who are seriously ill, but are not yet receiving this type of support from hospice. In this manner, outpatient palliative care clinics play a psychologically supportive role that can help extend the benefits of hospice to a wider population. 23 Finally, a significant proportion of visit time was spent assessing the patient's illness understanding, an evaluation that includes discussion of the patient's awareness of their prognosis, their information preferences, and their sense of the disease trajectory. Some patients want explicit prognostic information; others prefer a ''big picture'' approach; and others prefer not to be told their prognosis or are ambivalent. [24][25][26] Our general practice is to tailor information giving to the needs and wishes of each patient. Insofar as they may have been worried about distressing patients, research suggests that physicians' end-of-life discussions with cancer patients are not associated with psychological distress such as more worry or higher rates of major depressive disorder. Furthermore, these discussions can result in earlier referrals to hospice and less aggressive care, which is associated with improved patient quality of life and bereavement adjustment. 27,28 In contrast to concerns that palliative care referral may be overwhelming for patients or diminish hope, 29 this study shows that palliative care consultation is acceptable to patients who are early in their disease trajectory. Despite being within 8 weeks of diagnosis, patients were willing to sign informed consent to participate in a palliative care trial and over 99% of enrolled patients completed the initial palliative care visit. In addition, enrolled patients were a representative sample of NSCLC patients seen at this institution as 53% of eligible patients were accrued over 3 years.\nThis study has several limitations. First, it reflects the clinical practices of one palliative care outpatient group, which had trained together for a minimum of 1 year prior to participation in the study. Other clinical groups may develop different but equally effective approaches to outpatient consultation. Second, estimation of the total amount of time spent in consultation and the breakdown of this time was recorded in the medical record after the encounter based on the clinician's estimation, and is therefore subject to recall bias. Third, there was some overlap in the domains of the care components that may have caused some underreporting of services provided. For example, the majority of clinicians did not report time spent doing ''Referrals and Prescriptions'' although ''Symptom Management'' played a dominant role in most cases and presumably would have required medication adjustment and prescriptions. Finally, consultation composition and approach may also have been influenced by the design of the study, since follow-up visits were prearranged and thus difficult discussions could be postponed for a time later in the course of disease when patient and physician had established greater rapport and the topic was more pressing. However, this arrangement may be the ideal way for patients to experience palliative care, as an integrated part of oncology practice where difficult discussions with familiar palliative care clinicians appropriately follow the course of illness.\nAnother study limitation is that it included only patients with metastatic NSCLC, who are frequently symptomatic soon after diagnosis. 6,8 Such sampling may have resulted in a bias towards increased time spent on symptom management. However, the high frequency of symptoms in this population, as well as their overall short prognosis makes this population an ideal group for early involvement of palliative care. Future studies should explore whether early palliative care is acceptable and helpful to patients with other cancers who are less symptomatic and have a longer life expectancy.\nFuture work should also focus on more fully understanding the process of outpatient palliative care consultation in order to determine what aspects of the consultation are most effective. Although we do not have detailed information about how symptoms were assessed and treated or how discussions about illness understanding and coping were conducted, the approach documented here was associated with improved quality of life, less depression, and prolonged survival. 7 We need to further study the details of each component of the consultation in order to get a better understanding of what might be contributing to these striking outcomes.\nThese data are a first step to understanding the palliative care needs of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC. In addition, understanding the clinical components of palliative care consultation and the time required for consultation is essential for establishing effective practice and allocating resources. Referring clinicians can be assured that early palliative care consultation is acceptable to patients and that while symptom management is the predominant focus of consultation, many patients are open to discussing emotional aspects of their illness.", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist. The primary goal is to establish rapport with the patient and family. Symptom assessment establishes rapport and enables the clinician to assess patient willingness to discuss more serious topics.

A review of interventions to reduce caregiver strain and burden in those caring for cancer patients could not identify a suitable intervention to recommend for practice. 21 Another author concluded that ''at present, the evidence barely supports the claim that palliative care services provide effective support for informal caregivers'' (43, p.162). A recent systematic review of psychosocial interventions for family caregivers revealed that empirical inquiry regarding effective ways to provide support to family caregivers is still in its infancy. The authors acknowledged that unless this matter is redressed there will continue to be a disconnect between policy (that family caregivers' needs are assessed and adequately responded to) and clinical practice (health professionals operating without a suitable evidence base to support family caregivers). 44 Palliative care is also obliged to provide support for bereaved family relatives and it is recommended that bereavement services should be available to promote health, and reduce the risk of distress, dysfunction, or complicated grief. 6,45 However, major difficulties are evident in the following areas: ascertaining bereavement support needs, appropriate response strategies, and a lack of consistency between service delivery approaches and the associated skills required for bereavement care. 17,45,46 Palliative care services can improve some family caregiver outcomes 47,48 when compared with standard care. However, the limitations of satisfaction surveys administered to family caregivers need to be acknowledged. Although such survey results are often favorable, there is no generally accepted conceptual framework for measurement. Additional psychometric tools are therefore needed to accurately examine family caregivers' satisfaction. 49 Hence, the reality is that much more needs to be done if palliative care service providers are to offer evidence-based support designed to meet caregiver concerns. For example, it seems that many services may not be equipped to meet caregivers' specific needs. They may lack the resources to undertake the assessment and have inadequate strategies to enable a suitable response. Many health professionals are not sufficiently trained in palliative care, funding for services is limited, and support for family caregivers may not be viewed as a priority. 50,51 We are also concerned by lack of resources (in countries with seemingly well-developed economies) to provide optimal 24 hour a day, 7 day a week access to specialist palliative care advice regardless of where the person lives. 36,52,53 As family support is one of the hallmarks of palliative care, lack of access becomes a major issue because of the potentially serious implications for vulnerable family caregivers. 51 An additional concern is that in many countries with wellestablished palliative care systems more than half of those expected to die will not be seen by specialist palliative care services, especially among those who are visible minorities. 54,55 Another potentially concerning situation in the specialist palliative care clinical setting is that health professionals may tend to focus attention on the primary family caregiver and not the entire family. The reasons for this are pragmatic: many health services may not be suitably resourced to meet the needs of the whole family. 51 Agenda for the Future", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Research agenda", "text": "The need for more research to underpin support for family caregivers related to palliative care has been recognized by an international assembly of senior researchers. 56 It was also the rationale for the inception of the International Palliative Care Family Caregiver Research Collaboration (IPCFRC). 57 Also, findings from a recent systematic review 44 concluded that unless there is a major research investment in this area the claim 43 that palliative care services provide family caregivers with effective support will continue to be disputed.\nResearch associated with family caregivers is not without its challenges and many of these have been acknowledged elsewhere. 51 The future of family caregiver research can only be enhanced through rigorous methodological approaches and an increase in comprehensive evaluation of interventions and needs assessment tools. 16 This research should be underpinned by a relevant theoretical framework. One approach that seems to be consistently supported is the transactional model of coping, which asserts that caregivers make cognitive appraisals to determine the possible impact of a potentially stressful event. 58,59 The more resilient the caregiver is, or the greater the number of resources at his or her disposal to manage the role, the more likely he or she will adapt. In this way, family caregiving need not necessarily be viewed as an inherently negative experience; it can vary, depending upon the person's internal resources for coping. Such resources include feelings of preparedness, competence, having adequate information, and focusing on positive aspects of the role. Hence, this model may assist researchers to understand caregivers' responses to their experience. An important aspect of the model is to enable researchers to design and evaluate interventions that target domains that may assist caregivers to respond more avourably to their role. 59,60 Psychometrically sound instruments for use with family caregivers should be available for researchers to evaluate Approximately 50% of caregivers are below population norms on physical health, and rates of probable depression and anxiety in up to 44% of caregivers have been reported. 23,[32][33][34][35] Are responsible for numerous tasks, such as symptom management. 33 Are financially disadvantaged. 33,34,36 Become socially isolated. 9 Report unmet needs (typically aligned with lack of information about the caregiver role). 11 Have needs equal to and/or greater than the needs of patients. 37 (2) Confounding factors impact upon the caregiving role:\nCaregivers have very limited firsthand exposure to death and dying. 11,33 Caregivers are often excluded from information and care planning and consequently feel underprepared for their role. 11,38 (3) Caregivers have the potential for positive outcomes and gains. Caregivers: Can contemporaneously improve the care of palliative care patients. 39 Have the potential (with suitable support) to gain positive outcomes from the role. 11,34,40 Are pivotal to achieving ''successful'' home care (where most people prefer to die). 12,16,41 Make a remarkable economic contribution to health care. 22 May significantly enhance the well-being of patients when they are well supported. 41,42 FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND PALLIATIVE CARE 865\ninterventions and to allow clinicians to effectively elicit, assess, and monitor caregivers' ongoing needs. 22 A systematic review undertaken to identify articles that described the use of instruments administered to family caregivers of palliative care patients (pre and post-bereavement) found that although a considerable variety of instruments have been administered to family caregivers, their validity is often lacking or is still being determined. 24 Moreover, the reviewers concluded that apart from a couple of specific areas, researchers should exercise caution before developing new instruments for this population.\nFindings from reviews of the general caregiving literature (incorporating palliative care) 20 have found that the typical reasons interventions have been unsuccessful include: (1) outcome measures utilized have not been sufficiently sensitive to change, (2) the elements of the interventions have not been specific enough to meet caregiver needs, and (3) most interventions have been multidimensional; hence the type of evaluation performed has not been conducive to determining which components of the intervention were more or less effective. The literature demonstrates that interventions aimed toward psychoeducation, problem-solving, and cognitive restructuring can show demonstrable effects on caregiver well-being. 20,44 Several other methodological recommendations for improving family caregiver research have been suggested and these are summarized in Table 2.\nIn addition, there is no clear consensus as to whether or not group versus individual interventions are more effective. 20,63 Our contention is that this debate is not worth pursuing as it appears that some family caregivers will prefer and possibly be more likely to favorably respond to single approaches and for others, group formats may be more acceptable. Hence, a suite of interventions is required so that caregivers can access the one that best matches their needs and preferences.\nIt would also appear that there are commonalities between different caregiver populations, in terms of the experience of the caregiver role and what helps them. 20 This claim supports the view put forward by others 51 who argue that there may be ways of designing interventions for supporting caregivers that have generic application, while acknowledging there will always be the need for individual variation.\nFinally, with regard to methodological recommendations, Eagar and colleagues make a salient point by recognizing that ''a lack of good evidence for whether an intervention is successful or not is not the same as evidence for its ineffectiveness, as often the problems are methodological (with the design of the study) rather than associated with the logic or acceptability of what was offered to the caregiver.'' 20 Other more general recommendations for enhancing family caregiver research include fostering research networks and collaborations, developing specific research program areas, dedicated conferences that focus on family caregivers, and lobbying organizations to promote capacity building (Ph.D.s and postdoctoral funding) in this area. 31,57,64 A recent international survey to determine the priority research topics for family caregivers and palliative care 31 revealed similar findings to those of systematic reviews. There is a demonstrated need for intervention development focused on improving family caregiver support and a recognition that there is already a substantial body of literature on caregivers' needs. 8,22,24 Additional survey results showed that other key areas that warrant research attention include underresearched family caregiver subpopulations (e.g., young caregivers, ethnic minorities), the bereavement experience and support, and assessing unmet needs and development of methods (e.g., assessment tools) to identify family caregivers at risk of poor psychosocial well-being. Future work might focus on elaborating on these areas by comprehensively scoping specific research questions. 31 ", "n_publication_ref": 54, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Clinical and social agenda", "text": "Although a significant proportion of family caregivers experience poor psychosocial well-being, many will identify some positive consequences associated with the role. 45,65 This does not mean that most caregivers do not need support. On the contrary, they should be offered support that is targeted according to their needs in a way that will help sustain them in their role and promote optimal psychosocial well-being including during bereavement. 51 From a social and policy perspective caregivers need to be supported by care systems that actually lessen rather than increase the burden of caregiving. For example, poor communication, lack of information, inflexible health care appointments (often at different hospital clinics and requiring repeated time off work), and slow response to request for services all add to caregiver frustration. To alleviate some of these burdens, periods of respite might be found in physical rest, social interaction, education, recreation, or employment outside the home. 51,66 In addition, caregivers' financial security is not always given the priority it deserves. Such security may be derived from flexible arrangements to continue work or to reduce work commitments and hours, together with protection of career progression and pension rights. Caregivers' social inclusion also requires increased attention and appropriate levels of welfare benefits made available. Increased policy recognition of caregivers' rights, and processes to involve them in major health and social care changes, are some of the means by which caregivers can make their contributions as citizens. 51 A public health approach for families is also warranted so that death and dying can be viewed once again as a part of life (rather than, for example, as a medical failure) and the term ", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "HUDSON AND PAYNE", "text": "''palliative care'' more widely understood. 51 A public health approach should also focus on addressing the lack of support for caregivers in impoverished regions and for minority caregiver groups. Realistic objectives are needed to support family caregivers. Some are of the opinion 67 that from a policy and standards perspective it may indeed be quite untenable for health and social care professionals to improve family caregivers' quality of life (as promoted, for example, by the World Health Organization). In addition, in settings where the time frame that specialist palliative care clinical services are directly involved with family caregivers is short it would seem quite impracticable to set such unachievable goals. 51 Where health and social care resources are not sufficient to support the needs of the entire family as well as the patient, care should be directed toward one or two family or friends whom the patient acknowledges to be the most important support people. This is not to say that others ought to be excluded; ideally, the primary caregiver(s) could act as the information sharer and family spokesperson with other members of the family and involve them in key decisions as appropriate. 51 We acknowledge that this may not be viable in all clinical and service delivery situations; for example, some families are disenfranchised and others experience significant conflict. 68 In such cases palliative care services should provide support where they can in matters related directly to end-of-life care. In our opinion it is not reasonable (unless suitable resources exist) to expect palliative care clinical services to try and reconcile family differences, or to resolve conflict that may have existed for decades. This is not to ignore the need for referral to generic counseling services in some instances; however, unless there is a major injection of funding, therapeutically oriented general family counseling should not be the core function of palliative care services whose priorities lie elsewhere. 51 Family caregivers have consistently expressed their need for the following: education to prepare them for their role, about how to respond to the challenges (physical, social, spiritual, and psychological) of the role, and about how to access resources (internal and external) to assist them to maintain optimal psychosocial well-being. 33,69 These domains are commensurate with the ''good death'' literature describing what most family caregivers seem to value in terms of optimal end-of-life care. Families expect that their relative's symptoms should be managed, that they will be offered emotional, social, and spiritual support, that treatment decisions will be respected, that they will have access to respite care and bereavement support, and preference for site of death will be supported. 70,71 We maintain however that this support should be targeted, time limited, evaluated regularly, and based upon best available evidence. For example, we agree that ongoing formal bereavement support may not be required by all family caregivers; rather, it must be based on need and justify prudent use of resources. 51,67 Caregiver support will also require input from suitably trained health and social care professionals 16 and the agenda for the future should incorporate direct input from family caregivers.", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Palliative care is meant to be ''family centred'' and the ''unit of care'' (which includes the patient and the family) is core to all its functions.

A comprehensive approach is required to address this situation, incorporating public health, research, clinical practice, and policy initiatives. A significant benefit for caregivers might arise from changes to fiscal policy, such as tax credits for caregiving or enhanced pension rights. Much attention has been placed on direct ''support'' services to caregivers, however an equally pressing issue relates to the types of support that are most beneficial and timely. These are important research questions. We see the need for improved information, training, and brokerage services for caregivers so they are able to take greater control of their circumstances and utilize those services that are available within their local communities. 51 Unless there are substantial and sustained commitments to improve services and resources for family caregivers, by governments, health authorities, and research councils, palliative care will fail to deliver upon its core function of adequately supporting the patient along with the family.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No conflicting financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "World Health Organisation: National Cancer Control Programmes: Policies and Managerial Guidelines", "journal": "WHO", "year": "2002", "authors": ""}, {"title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "B Ferrell; S R Connor; A Cordes; C M Dahlin; P G Fine; N Hutton; M Leenay; J Lentz; J L Person; D E Meier; K Zuroski"}, {"title": "National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care Task Force Members: The national agenda for quality palliative care: The national consensus project and the national quality forum", "journal": "J Pain Symptom Manage", "year": "2007", "authors": ""}, {"title": "National Institutes of Health: National Institutes of Health state-of-the-science conference statement on improving endof-life care", "journal": "", "year": "2004", "authors": ""}, {"title": "Palliative Care Australia: Standards for Providing Quality Palliative Care for All Australians.

For development of palliative care programs that adequately address symptoms of patients with COPD or CHF, it is necessary to know severity of symptom distress and to gain insight in comorbidities and current provision of health care. Objective of the present cross-sectional observational study was to assess severity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities, and current provision of health care in outpatients with advanced COPD or CHF. Methods: A total of 105 outpatients with clinically stable but advanced COPD (Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage III or IV) and 80 patients with advanced CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV) were assessed for demographics, clinical characteristics, self-reported comorbidities, and severity of symptoms using visual analogue scales. In addition, current health care and symptom-related interventions have been assessed. Results: Comorbidities were reported by 96.3% of the CHF patients and 61.9% of the COPD patients. Patients suffered from multiple symptoms, like dyspnea, fatigue, muscle weakness, coughing, low mood, sleeplessness, and frequent micturition. For most symptoms, only the minority of patients had received symptom-related treatment. Involvement of allied health care professionals was low. The majority of COPD and CHF patients had received home adaptation and medical aids. Conclusions: Patients with advanced COPD or CHF experience comorbidities and suffer from multiple symptoms, which are often under treated.

[2][3][4] Recent studies suggest that burden of symptoms in patients with advanced COPD or CHF is high and is associated with impairment of quality of life. [4][5][6] However, it remains unknown whether and to what extent the burden of symptoms is comparable between patients with advanced COPD and CHF. 7 In addition, little is known regarding symptom-related interventions and the current utilization of health care for patients with advanced COPD or CHF. A retrospective study of COPD patients in their last year of life suggests that the frequency of contact with health care professionals is low and that the care provided by health and social services is inadequate. 8 Furthermore, elderly COPD patients may receive less support from health care professionals and social services than similarly disabled persons without COPD. 9 For development of palliative care programs for patients with advanced COPD or CHF which adequately address symptoms, it is necessary to know the severity of symptoms, the presence of symptom-related interventions and utilization of health care.\nFurthermore, while recent studies concerning symptom burden in COPD and CHF excluded patients with lifethreatening comorbidities, 5,6 comorbidities in these patients may be common. 4,10,11 Presence of comorbidities may influence the palliative care needs and insight in the presence of comorbidities is necessary to understand how models of palliative care should be developed for these patients.\nTherefore, the aim of the present study was to assess severity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities and current provision of health care in patients with advanced COPD or CHF.\nWe hypothesized a priori that comorbidities in advanced COPD or CHF are highly prevalent and that the experience of symptoms is similar, irrespective of the underlying disease.

FEV 1 was calculated from the flow-volume curve measured by a handheld pulmonary spirometer. 15 NT-proBNP levels have been measured. NT-proBNP levels equal to or greater than 15 pmol/L may indicate the presence of CHF in COPD patients. 16 Severity of 20 self-perceived physical and psychological symptoms was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for every symptom. VAS is a horizontal straight line, ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 100 mm (maximum severity). 17 The patients had to mark on the line the point that represented the self-perceived severity of the symptom during the previous 2 weeks. The VAS score has been determined by measuring in millimeters from the left side of the line to the point the patient marked. 17 Symptoms were selected based on previous research. 7 The initial version of the VAS symptom checklist was reviewed by physician specialists of the project team and a physician specialist who was not involved in the project. Based on their expert opinion, several symptoms were added to the VAS symptom checklist.\nIn addition to rating severity of symptoms, patients were asked, if they had received symptom-related treatment (response options: ''yes'' or ''no'') for each reported symptom. Patients who reported that they received symptomrelated treatment had to rate their satisfaction with this treatment using VAS. VAS for satisfaction with treatment of the symptom ranged from 0 (not satisfied) to 100 mm (very satisfied).\nIn addition, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a validated and reliable measurement instrument used widely in medically ill patients to screen for clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. 18 The HADS is divided into an anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a depression subscale (HADS-D). Total scores for each subscale can range from 0 (\u00bc optimal) to 21 (\u00bc worst) points. A score equal to or greater than 10 for anxiety and/or depression has been defined as abnormally high and may indicate the presence of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. 18 Finally, use of medication, contacts with health care professionals (general practitioner, physician specialist, nurse, and allied health care professionals), use of long-term oxygen therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, home adaptation, and availability of medical aids were assessed using a health care checklist.

The concurrent existence of CHF in COPD patients has been shown before in elderly COPD patients. 10 This study shows that in patients with advanced COPD or CHF regular assessment of comorbidities is necessary.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Symptom distress and health care provision", "text": "Patients suffered from multiple symptoms including dyspnea, fatigue, muscle weakness, coughing, low mood, sleeplessness, and frequent micturition. The fact that fatigue and dyspnea are distressing symptoms in advanced COPD or CHF is in line with previous findings. 5,6,23 Previously, the retrospective study of Elkington and colleagues 8 suggested that health care is blind to the palliative care needs of COPD patients. The present prospective study shows that patients with advanced COPD or CHF suffer from multiple symptoms, while attention for symptom management seems to be limited. While in general patients are satisfied with their medical treatment, symptom distress is high and for most symptoms only a small minority of patients re-port that their symptoms are addressed. Furthermore, if symptoms are addressed, patients only report moderate satisfaction with symptom treatment. Therefore, the present study confirms the previous findings of Elkington and colleagues 8 in advanced COPD and CHF.\nA majority of the patients had infrequent contact with their general practitioner for their chronic disease. The infrequent general practitioner contact of the current sample suggest that general practitioners do not offer these patients treatment with an integrative and anticipatory approach. Therefore, it is unlikely that management of these patients in primary care focuses on prevention and early recognition and treatment of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems.\nOnly a few patients used medication for palliation of symptoms, like opioids. Although use of opioids for treatment of severe dyspnea in COPD is recommended in the most recent Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Policy Statement: Palliative Care for Patients with Respiratory Diseases and Critical Illnesses, 24 in the present study only 1.9% of COPD patients used strong opioids like morphine while 57.1% reported severe dyspnea. Au and colleagues 25 have shown in a retrospective study that only 25% of COPD patients in their last 6 months of life received opioids, while 49% of patients with lung cancer received opioids in their last 6 months of life. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of opioids for the palliation of severe dyspnea in advanced COPD or CHF are scarce [26][27][28] and further research is needed to determine which patients should get opioids prescribed to treat their dyspnea. 29 Previous studies have shown that symptoms of depression are frequently undertreated in patients with COPD. 30,31 This is supported by the present study. Only a minority of the patients with advanced COPD or CHF reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression received counseling by a psychologist or used antidepressant drugs. In patients with clinically relevant symptoms of depression, further assessment is warranted to identify those patients needing medical treatment for a depression. 31 Almost one third of the COPD patients used maintenance systemic corticosteroids, which is not in line with the currently available guidelines for management of COPD. 32 Physicians should pay careful attention to the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids. Indeed, systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be associated with lower limb muscle weakness and increased mortality risk. 33,34 Care needs of patients with advanced COPD or CHF demand an interdisciplinary approach. 3,24 Nevertheless, this study shows limited involvement of allied health care professionals. Provision of physiotherapy is highest for COPD patients, probably reflecting the Dutch physiotherapy guidelines for COPD. 35 However, symptoms such as muscle weakness and fatigue are also frequently reported by CHF patients, but only a minority of these patients are treated by a physiotherapist. This probably reflects a need for physical exercise training in patients with advanced CHF. 36,37 Limitations of the present study\nThe study population consisted of a convenience sample of patients. While the majority of eligible COPD patients were willing to participate, the response rate for CHF patients was below 50%. The current response rate confirms the previously reported difficulty of recruitment of older patients with CHF 38 and may limit the generalizability of the results.\nIn addition, some differences were present between patients with COPD and CHF, which could have influenced the results of this study. Although age differences in this study are statistically significant, the clinical relevance for the present study may be limited, as is shown by the lack of correlation between number of experienced symptoms and age.\nThere is no consensus about standardization of symptom assessment in palliative medicine and multiple instruments are available. 39 We have chosen the use of VAS to assess severity of symptoms because of the previously shown validity, test-retest reliability and clinical utility. 17,40 Furthermore, VAS is continuous, approximates a ratio scale, and is more independent from language than verbal scales. 41 However, the choice of the instrument might have influenced the results of this study.\nFinally, the present study is a cross-sectional study and symptom distress and health care provision are likely to change during the course of the disease. A longitudinal follow-up is needed to know how symptom distress and health care provision change over time in patients with advanced COPD or CHF.", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Implications", "text": "Patients with advanced COPD or CHF suffer from comorbidities and multiple symptoms.

Authors and nephrologists were contacted to identify additional studies. Articles were reviewed by two authors and selected if they described stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients managed without dialysis, including one or more of the following outcomes: prognosis, symptoms, or QOL. Levels of evidence ratings were assigned using the SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy) system. Data was abstracted independently by two authors for descriptive analysis. Results: Thirteen studies were included. In studies of prognosis, conservative management resulted in median survival of at least six months (range 6.3 to 23.4 months). Findings are mixed as to whether dialysis prolongs survival in the elderly versus conservative, nondialytic management. Any survival benefit from dialysis decreases with comorbidities, especially ischemic heart disease. Patients managed conservatively report a high symptom burden, underscoring the need for concurrent palliative care. Additional head-to-head studies are needed to compare the symptoms of age-matched dialysis patients, but preliminary studies suggest that QOL is similar.

The dialysis industry then grew exponentially, allowing for relaxation of acceptance criteria. Dialysis is currently offered to many patients who would not have been considered suitable during the early decades of outpatient dialysis.\nThe elderly constitute the fastest growing subset of the dialysis population. 1 The number of patients aged 80 years and older starting dialysis in the United States increased from 7054 in 1996 to 13,577 in 2003. 2 The current dialysis population also has more comorbid conditions. The number of end-stage renal disease patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease increased from 13.8% in 2005 to 21.0% in 2007; the incidence of cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increased as well. 1 A recent study of neuropsychiatric testing in hemodialysis patients found that 37% had severe cognitive impairment and 36% had moderate impairment. 3 Finally, dialysis is increasingly offered to patients with impaired functional status. In 2007, 11.2% of dialysis patients required assistance with basic activities of daily living. 1 The elderly have increased morbidity and mortality on dialysis. 4 One study of dialysis patients 75 years old and older reported a one-year mortality of 46.5% with patients spending an average of 20% of days in the hospital. 5 Comorbid conditions also increase mortality, independent of age. 6 In response to the aging population and trends of dialyzing older and sicker patients, interest is growing in nondialytic alternatives for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The Renal Physicians Association recently updated their practice guideline affirming the rights of patients to refuse dialysis initiation. 7 The guideline specifically mentions patients with profound neurological impairment or a nonrenal terminal disease, but there may be other populations in which the burden of dialysis outweighs the potential benefit, such as the very elderly and patients with multiple comorbid diseases. The UK Renal Association recommends discussing the risks and benefits of renal replacement therapy prior to dialysis initiation with special attention to nutritional status, comorbid conditions, and functional status. 8 Conservative (nondialytic) management of ESRD includes careful attention to fluid balance, treatment of anemia, and correction of acidosis and hyperkalemia. Blood pressure and calcium/phosphorus metabolism must also be managed. 9 There is emerging evidence that dietary modifications may be helpful in prolonging life and decreasing symptoms 10 Finally, individualized symptom management and palliative care are crucial to maximize QOL. [11][12][13] Despite the importance of conservative management as an option for patients with ESRD, many clinicians are unfamiliar with this approach and lack the information to counsel patients and families. In addition, rigorous evidence about the actual benefits of dialysis in frail populations has not been synthesized.

Only three articles addressed QOL 24,28,29 standardized tools included the Short Form 36 Health Survey and the Euroqol-5Q questionnaire, both of which have been previously validated. 30,31 One study by DeBiase et al. also included semistructured interviews of both patients and caregivers. 29 All of the patients undergoing conservative management reported significant symptom burden, with the average number of symptoms varying from 6.8 to 17. The most common symptoms included weakness, lack of energy, poor appetite, pruritus, drowsiness, dyspnea, pain, edema, and difficulty sleeping; symptoms were relatively consistent across studies. Symptom burden and severity increased in the month prior to death. 23 Three of the studies of symptoms and QOL included a comparison group. The study by Saini et al. compared conservatively managed ESRD patients to a comparison group of patients with terminal malignancy. 24 The median number of symptoms was similar between groups, emphasizing the high symptom burden in ESRD. Additionally, both groups had similarly impaired QOL.\nThe study by Yong et al. directly compared dialysis and conservative management patients, reporting similar symptom burden and QOL between groups. 28 In the study by DeBiase et al., elderly patients undergoing conservative management were compared to a group of patients who ", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "232", "text": "O'CONNOR AND KUMAR initiated dialysis despite a physician's recommendation for nondialytic management. 29 Patients in the dialysis group were slightly younger and had fewer comorbid conditions than patients in the conservative management group. Despite these differences, QOL was similar between groups as determined by standardized questionnaires and interviews.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "This systematic review demonstrates that conservative, nondialytic management of ESRD is a viable option in certain patients. For the elderly and patients with multiple comorbid conditions, dialysis does not always offer a survival advantage. Five prognosis studies in this review included both conservative management and dialysis patients; three of these studies found a statistically significant survival benefit with dialysis, but the other two found no difference. Patients with multiple comorbid conditions, especially ischemic heart disease, were the least likely to experience a survival benefit.\nFuture research could develop clinical tools to predict which patients will survive longer with dialysis versus conservative management. Several models already exist to predict survival on dialysis, [32][33][34] but similar models have not yet been developed for conservative management. In the meantime, physicians must rely on clinical judgment and the preliminary results presented in this review. If dialysis is not expected to prolong life due to extremely advanced age or comorbid conditions, patients and families should receive counseling to ensure that their expectations are realistic. 35 Even when dialysis can be expected to prolong survival, the burdens of dialysis (cost, infections, vascular access issues, fluctuating blood pressure) deserve careful consideration. The prognosis study by Carson et al. included additional analyses of hospitalization rates and location of death 21 Dialysis patients spent a greater proportion of days in the hospital compared with conservative management patients (25 versus 16 days per patient per year). Conservative management patients were four times more likely to die at home or in a hospice (OR 4.15; 95% CI 1.67 to 10.25). Routine outpatient hemodialysis is also extremely time consuming. Thus, while patients may live longer with dialysis, they can expect to spend a significant proportion of that time in a medical setting. Patients and families differ in how they prioritize prolonging life versus maximizing time at home; these preferences are important to elicit when discussing dialysis initiation.\nThere are several limitations to the conclusions from this systematic review. As already mentioned, the literature in this field is widely dispersed and difficult to target with database search strategies. We believe that we overcame this limitation through multiple other methodologies to locate articles, but it is possible that a study was missed.\nThe prognosis studies exhibit significant variability in inclusion criteria, resulting in heterogeneous study populations. In addition, different starting points were used in the measurement of survival (decision not to initiate dialysis, proposed date of first dialysis, first measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \u00a3 10.8, and first measurement of GFR < 15). These factors contribute to the wide variability in reported survival. While this variability makes it more difficult to counsel individual patients about what to expect with conservative management, this systematic review provides at least a starting point for discussion.\nThe results of this review may not be generalizable to nursing home residents, a growing subset of the population; patients in the included studies were recruited from ambulatory clinics and were cognitively intact. Nursing home residents have especially poor outcomes on dialysis with a mortality rate of 58% in the first year. 36 Pre-dialysis functional status is maintained in only 13% of nursing home residents after one year on dialysis. 36 Comparable data for conservative management is needed to fully inform discussions about dialysis initiation in this population.\nIt is clear that conservatively managed patients have many symptoms. Unfortunately, none of the symptom studies conducted a head-to-head comparison of conservative management versus dialysis. It is possible that patients on dialysis have similarly high symptom burden; additional research is needed to address this question. In the meantime, patients considering conservative management should be informed of the high incidence of various symptoms and then reassured that aggressive symptom management will be part of their care. A recent longitudinal cohort study found that functional status with nondialytic management remains relatively constant until the last month of life. 37 A second study of conservative management found an increase in symptom distress and health related concerns in the last two months of life. 38 The findings presented on QOL are limited and preliminary. The included studies compare small groups of patients, and the results are not stratified by age or comorbidities to allow more precise determination of which patients benefit from dialysis in terms of QOL. Larger head-to-head studies would allow qualitative and quantitative QOL analyses to guide patient decision making. Ideally, comparative data about both survival and QOL would be presented when counseling patients about dialysis versus conservative management.\nNew evidence suggests that delayed initiation may also be a safe alternative in patients who ultimately choose dialysis. A recent trial randomized 828 patients to dialysis initiation when their GFR reached 10.0 to 14.0 ml per minute (early start) or when their GFR reached 5.0 to 7.0 ml per minute (late start). 39 During a median follow-up period of 3.59 years, there was no significant difference between groups in mortality or the frequency of adverse events. Initiating dialysis later in the disease course would give patients and physicians additional time to determine whether dialysis is the best treatment option.\nFor patients who opt for conservative management, guidelines are needed to determine the best clinical practices in nondialytic management. Most nephrologists currently extrapolate fluid and electrolyte management from earlierstage CKD. Several centers are starting to develop specialized renal palliative care teams to provide concurrent renal care and symptom management for patients who decline or discontinue dialysis. [40][41][42] These multidisciplinary teams typically include nurses, social workers, and physicians from both nephrology and palliative care. Preliminary data suggests that they are successful in managing symptoms 40 and providing for advanced care planning and family support. 42 ESRD represents a growing opportunity to offer palliative care to a nonmalignant disease with extensive end-of-life care needs.\nFinally, the results of this review demonstrate that failure to initiate dialysis is fundamentally different from the withdrawal of dialysis in which imminent death is expected.", "n_publication_ref": 15, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT OF END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE", "text": "Patients can live for months or even years after deciding not to start dialysis.

Many caregivers acknowledge positive aspects associated with the role; however a considerable proportion will experience poor psychological, social, financial, spiritual, and physical well-being and some will suffer from complicated grief. Many family caregivers have unmet needs and would like more information, preparation, and support to assist them in the caregiving role. There is a shortage of evidence-based strategies to guide health professionals in providing optimal support while the caregiver is providing care and after the patient's death. Purpose: To develop clinical practice guidelines for the psychosocial and bereavement support of family caregivers of palliative care patients. Methods: (1) Literature review; (2) focus groups and structured interviews with key stakeholders within Australia; (3) national and international expert opinion to further develop and refine the guidelines using a modified Delphi process; and (4) endorsement of the guidelines from key palliative care, caregiver, and bereavement organizations (national and international). Results: The guidelines were developed for multidisciplinary health care professionals and clinical services commonly involved in caring for adult patients receiving palliative care in a variety of care sites throughout Australia. These consensus-based guidelines have been endorsed key Australian and international organizations.

Approximately 50% of caregivers are below population norms on physical health, and rates of depression and anxiety (based on screening measures) in up to 44% of caregivers have been reported. [7][8][9][10][11][12] Complicated grief where debilitating grief is experienced for an extended period is noted in approximately 10% to 20% of family caregivers. 26,27 A lack of preparedness for the patient's death has been associated with complicated grief. 28 Unmet needs are consistently cited in the literature that relate to the lack of psychological support for family caregivers. 29 Emotionally burdened family members can hinder patients' adjustment to their illness. 30 Clinicians may normalize the distress or lack the awareness and skill to differentiate distress from sadness, contributing to under-detection; limited management options may also discourage detection. 31 In a review of interventions to reduce caregiver strain and burden in those caring for cancer patients no suitable intervention could be identified as recommended practice. 32 Recent systematic reviews of interventions for family caregivers reveal that empirical inquiry regarding effective ways to provide psychosocial support to family caregivers is still in its infancy. 33,34 There is evidence that implementing clinical guidelines, protocols, and tools facilitates improvements in care. Examples include timely referrals to palliative care, reduced emergency department admissions, decreased length of stay in hospital, and an increase in the proportion of deaths at home or in a non-acute care facility. [35][36][37][38] Given this background of less than optimal support for family caregivers and limited interventions to assist this population, we aimed to develop guidelines for the psychosocial and bereavement support of family caregivers of palliative care patients. The primary target audience for the guidelines were multidisciplinary health care professionals commonly involved in caring for adult patients receiving specialist palliative care (home, hospital, hospice) throughout Australia. It was also intended that the guidelines be designed to have relevance for generalist health care providers who occasionally provide palliative care and for the international palliative care community.", "n_publication_ref": 55, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Guideline Development Process", "text": "Development of the guidelines entailed: (1) literature review; (2) draft guidelines prepared by the project team based on literature review; (3) focus groups and structured inter-views with key stakeholders within Australia; (4) revision of guidelines based on findings from focus groups and interviews; (5) national and international expert opinion to further develop and refine the guidelines using a modified Delphi process; (6) revision of guidelines based on findings from the Delphi process; and (7) obtaining endorsement of guidelines by key organizations (national and international).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Literature review", "text": "The literature review was carried out to evaluate information published in the last decade related to family caregivers of palliative care patients. The objectives were (1) to outline the experiences, impact, and needs of family caregivers during care provision for their relative and into bereavement; (2) to review evidence-based psychosocial and bereavement support interventions for family caregivers of palliative care patients; and (3) to use the review as a reference for evaluating the levels of evidence for the guideline development process. The specific search strategy, inclusion criteria, and results are outlined elsewhere. 33,39 Development of first draft of guidelines and review of levels of evidence A meeting with the project investigators was arranged to review and further develop the first draft of the clinical guidelines. The project team consisted of a multidisciplinary group of academics, clinicians, a policy maker, and manager who had significant expertise in palliative and/or bereavement care. Prior to the meeting, project investigators were sent a copy of the literature review and a draft of the guidelines for review.\nThe evidence to support the guidelines was rated in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (Australia). 40 The NHMRC sets out the basis for rating key components of the body of evidence for each recommendation (guideline). Due to the paucity of highlevel evidence in this field, and the subsequent need to draw on evidence outside of the gold-standard randomized controlled trial, two further levels of evidence were added. Qualitative studies were acknowledged, and expert opinion was included to support some of the guidelines.

Participants were selected by members of the project team on the basis that they were recognized as an authority or expert in palliative and/or bereavement care.\nThe guidelines and a set of principles to underpin them developed by the research team were accompanied by a questionnaire comprising four parts. Part A was designed to collect participant information including gender; country; region (metropolitan, regional city, or rural area); current occupation; primary profession; and main area of speciality of participants. Part B consisted of one qualitative question inviting participants to review the principles (n = 13) and comment on the clarity and comprehensiveness of the principles. Part C invited participants to rate their level of agreement with each guideline and to provide feedback on each guideline. Part C questions were answered using a Likert scale of 1-5 (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree), with a sixth answer option of ''don't know.'' Four qualitative questions were included to ascertain further feedback from participants on each guideline and to encourage participants to provide further examples of good clinical practice and the source from which the example was generated (e.g., literature or personal experience). Part D provided participants with the opportunity to add general comments regarding the guidelines. The Delphi process was administered via the Internet using LimeSurvey\u00d2 software.\nThere is no standard level of consensus that should be attained by an expert panel involved in a Delphi process. 41 The research group made an a priori decision that a consensus required 75% or more of the members of the expert group to agree or strongly agree with the proposed guideline. Participant responses were evaluated and summarized to identify those guidelines with a high level of agreement and those for which there was no agreement or clear disagreement. To determine support or otherwise for each guideline, scores for each question were totalled, with a higher score indicating a more positive response to the guideline.\nDemographic data were subject to descriptive analysis (frequencies and percentages). Data were analyzed for each guideline separately (frequency, medians, means, standard deviations) to enable decisions to be made as to whether consensus had or had not been reached. Written comments were thematically analysed and data circulated to the research group for consideration. When consensus had been reached (greater or equal to 75% in agreement), the guideline was considered to be completed.\nFifty-two experts registered to participate in the survey (recruitment rate (52/82 = 63%) and 26 completed the survey, corresponding to a response rate of 50%.

Principles for Family Caregiver Support 1. The crucial role of family caregivers 1 in the care of the patient is acknowledged by the interdisciplinary team, and accordingly, family caregiver and bereavement support should be fully incorporated into service philosophy and standards of care. 2. Family caregivers should be offered needs assessments and access to relevant psychosocial support. 3. The focus of support should be the primary family caregiver(s), as identified by the patient. Where additional resources and skills are readily available, support is extended to other family caregivers. 4. Family caregiver and bereavement support is provided using resources based on the available evidence and best practice guidelines. 5. The focus of advice and support provided to the family caregiver(s) should be based on caregivers' choice and emphasize strategies to optimize their own well-being. 6. Communication with family caregiver(s) should be conducted in a manner that provides direct and clear information in a language they understand via a combination of mediums including verbal, written, or multimedia. Relevant confidentiality and legal requirements should be considered. 7. It is recommended that discussions around preparedness for the patient's death are responsive to the individual needs of the family caregiver(s). This may require discussing issues in stages according to the patient's declining physical condition. 8. Health care professionals and volunteers working with family caregivers should receive appropriate and ongoing training, support, and supervision relevant to their level of involvement. Training should be based on national standards and evidence-based guidelines. 9. Health care professionals, patients, and family caregivers should be aware of the limits of palliative and bereavement services. Referral to external specialist services or individuals should be undertaken when appropriate. 10. Family caregiver and bereavement support is provided with respect to individuals and their needs within a safe, confidential, and ethical approach that is sensitive to the caregivers' experience, culture, and social environment. 11. Although poor bereavement outcomes are associated with identified risk factors, there is minimal evidence to support routine intervention with all bereaved people. 12. Comprehensive care planning by the interdisciplinary team, involving the patient and family caregiver(s), is an ongoing process, rather than a single event. 13. All relevant discussions, assessments, and outcomes related to the patient and family caregiver(s) should be clearly documented in the most appropriate location (as per the service protocol). 14. A clear process for consumer complaints and feedback with regard to the quality of health professional support should be easily accessible to patients and family caregivers.\nAustralia's web-based knowledge transfer initiative, at www.caresearch.com.au.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "The Guidelines for the Psychosocial and Bereavement Support of Family Caregivers of Palliative Care Patients were developed in recognition that support for family caregivers is commonly less than satisfactory. The guideline development process was comprehensive and drawn from the latest evidence, input from multidisciplinary care providers, consumers, policy makers, and consensus-based expert opinion both nationally and internationally and linked to relevant practice standards. A variety of cultural groups are represented in the examples of best practice written to support the guidelines. Effort was also taken to include examples of best practice addressing nonmalignant disease and death occurring outside of a specialist palliative care setting. Once a patient has agreed to receive palliative care, inform the patient that the role of palliative care is also to support family caregiver(s). The family caregiver(s) will be a person(s) who the patient perceives to be his or her most important support person(s). This may be a family member, partner, or friend and may not necessarily be his or her next of kin. Guideline 2\nAsk the patient to identify the primary family caregiver. Where only one family caregiver is identified, ask the patient if there is another family member or friend who may be willing to be approached and act as an additional family caregiver. Discuss the patient's preferences for the involvement of the family caregiver in medical and care planning discussions and note this in the medical record and care plan. Guideline 3\nConfirm with the family caregiver(s) that they understand the patient has nominated them for this role.\nExplain the typical role and responsibilities of the family caregiver and confirm they are willing to accept this responsibility and note this in the medical record. Discuss any concerns that the family caregiver may have in accepting this role (including possible conflicts with other family members). Guideline 4\nDiscuss advance care planning with the patient and family covering any implications relating to the legal responsibilities of the family caregiver(s). Guideline 5\nRecognize the family caregiver as an important source of information about the patient. Gather information from the family caregiver about his or her experience as a support person for the patient, including any information (where pertinent) regarding the patient believed possibly to be important for the health care professional team to know about. Guideline 6\nExplain to the family caregiver(s) what services and resources can be provided by the palliative care service so that realistic expectations are established. Part 2: Assessing Need and Establishing a Plan of Care Guideline 7\nWhenever possible, convene a family meeting/case conference, including the patient if practicable. Guideline 8\nConduct a needs assessment with the family caregiver(s). This should include psychological and physical health, social, spiritual, cultural, financial, and practical elements.

Guideline 18\nContact the family caregiver(s) and other family members (as appropriate) to assess needs at three to six weeks post-death and adapt bereavement care plan accordingly. Guideline 19\nConduct a follow-up assessment of the family caregiver(s) and other family members (if appropriate) six months post-death. Guideline 20\nFollowing the death of a patient, the interdisciplinary team should have a discussion (at an appropriate time) about the quality of care provided to the patient and family caregiver(s) and the nature of the death.\nThere are several limitations associated with the guidelines. First and foremost, there is currently no formal requirement for services to use the guidelines. Second, the response and completion rates associated with the Delphi process were less than optimal. The length of the survey may have been an impediment to completion. Third, a lack of high-level evidence in this field meant alternate evidence, including qualitative literature and expert opinion, was occasionally required to support the guidelines. Fourth, we acknowledge that it may not be possible for all health care professionals to practice in accordance with all the guidelines. Nonetheless, we advocate that where possible the guidelines should be followed and an effort should be made (e.g., seeking additional resources where relevant) to meet the guidelines in the future. Finally, although the guidelines have been disseminated widely thus far, there is no funded implementation or evaluation plan; this is strongly advocated. In particular it would be helpful to explore strategies for the uptake and impact of the guidelines for generalist health care providers and the international palliative care community. We encourage people to adapt the guidelines (with due acknowledgment) to meet specific local needs as pertinent and to examine their impact.\nThese limitations reinforce the need for subsequent research and evaluation. For example, conducting a bereavement risk assessment using appropriate and reliable methods and then offering effective bereavement interventions requires further investigation. It is intended that these guidelines will improve the quality of support provided to family caregivers of people receiving palliative care. It would be ideal if policy makers and service managers promoted their use. Additional research is required to determine if this goal can be achieved and to determine the impact of the guidelines.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Author Disclosure Statement", "text": "No competing financial interests exist.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "World Health Organisation.

This approach has been associated with improved quality of life, lower rates of depression, and, even, prolonged survival. 1,2 Many patients with cancer hold an inaccurate view of the goals of treatment and their prognosis. 3,4 These patients have a low ''prognostic awareness.'' We define prognostic awareness as a patient's capacity to understand his or her prognosis and the likely illness trajectory. Improving a patient's prognostic awareness is an important component of early palliative care because a more accurate understanding of prognosis is associated with earlier enrollment in hospice and lower rates of resuscitation for patients with incurable cancer. 5,6 Palliative care clinicians can facilitate enhanced prognostic awareness in patients with cancer through the use of advanced communication techniques. 1 Our clinical experience in caring for patients early in the course of illness is that although most are provided with statistical information about their prognosis by their oncologist, many patients react to the information they have received in ways that leave them unable to make personal or medical decisions. Some patients react by not wanting to think or talk about their prognosis. Others feel the information does not apply to their situation or cognitively integrate the information but feel too emotionally burdened and decide to put off dealing with their mortality until a future point. We classify these patients as having a low level of prognostic awareness.\nOver the course of receiving care from a skilled palliative care clinician, we have found that many of these patients seem to develop an increased capacity to tolerate discussions about prognosis and accept what this information means to them personally. Many of these patients develop the ability to hear, process, and draw on prognostic information to make medical decisions that match their own values-and are grateful to the clinician who worked with them to reach that point. In summary, we observe patients gradually develop prognostic awareness through an incremental cognitive and emotional process that can be cultivated over time through interaction with a skilled clinician.\nWe outline here an expert practice that provides a stepwise approach to cultivating prognostic awareness in patients cared for by a palliative care clinician early in the course of the patient's disease. We illustrate our approach with a case that unfolds over months. This approach can be used by both novice and more experienced palliative care clinicians. It requires the clinician to assess the patient's level of prognostic awareness, coping, and clinical status. The patient's clinical status is a key component of this approach. Thus, we believe this communication approach will be most useful for clinicians who can draw on both medical and psychosocial skills.\nCase (a): Dan Murphy is a 54-year-old man with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed 3 months prior to his first palliative care clinic appointment, now on first-line chemotherapy. He is a successful businessman who is married and has three children. His oncologist, Dr. Anna Simpson, is concerned that his disease is progressing but that ''he just doesn't get it.'' In his first visit, Dan tells Dr. Linda Hancock, the palliative care physician, that, ''I am fine. I mean, I know this is bad but I have to beat this no matter what Dr. Simpson says. I have a family, you know. I want you to help me feel well while I get all this chemotherapy. Just like I told Dr. Simpson, I want you to always be straight with me and hopeful. If you can do that, we will get along just fine.''", "n_publication_ref": 7, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Challenges in Enabling Patients To Cultivate Prognostic Awareness", "text": "What is the prognosis?\nClinicians commonly question their ability to accurately prognosticate about life expectancy. Christakis has shown that clinicians systematically overestimate their patients' life expectancy by a factor of five. 7 Although these data suggest that a clinician's ability to estimate prognosis is an inaccurate science, studies show that patients prefer clinicians to relate the best information they have in a timely fashion. 8 Patients will make different plans for the future if they have a sense that their life expectancy is on the order of days to weeks or weeks to months. 5,6 Discussions of prognosis should not only address life expectancy but also include information about the likely disease trajectory. Both pieces of data provide important information to the patient. Unless patients have witnessed another person navigate the same illness, they often have little idea about what to expect either from the treatment or the disease itself. Providing information about the likely disease trajectory helps patients plan and hope for things that are likely possible within the context of the illness.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "How much prognostic information has the patient integrated?", "text": "Clinicians must first have a sense of what the patient already knows and is able to articulate about the prognosis. This assessment is best accomplished by using open-ended questions that make no assumptions about what information the patient has integrated thus far.\nOne challenge that referring oncologists commonly note is that, despite having detailed conversations about prognosis, patients are often unable to articulate an understanding of what was said. Clinicians often assume that the reason the patient has not integrated the information is either because they were not clear in the communication or that the patient ''just doesn't get it.'' 9 It is vital for clinicians to appreciate that a patient's inability to integrate prognostic information after one or even multiple conversations is typical and should be expected. Patients integrate prognostic information at a pace that they can tolerate and that preserves their ability to function in the world. 10,11 This process can be incredibly confusing to clinicians who have worked hard to clearly discuss prognosis only to have a patient seem to have very little recall or understanding of the information delivered by the clinician. This reality makes the question ''what does the patient know?'' a significant challenge for oncology and palliative care clinicians who are collaborating in the care of a patient. 9 What does the patient want to know?\nPatients are often ambivalent about receiving prognostic information. In survey studies, a majority report contradictory wishes, as did Dan in our case example, wanting their clinicians to be hopeful and also honest. 12 Patients may request prognostic information but then become angry when the in-formation is provided. These experiences can lead clinicians to avoid conversations of prognosis and illness trajectory.", "n_publication_ref": 5, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "What if the patient doesn't want to discuss prognosis?", "text": "Another challenging situation occurs when the patient's medical condition is declining yet the patient is still providing cues that he or she is unwilling to discuss prognosis. In this situation, clinicians often feel that whatever approach they take will have undesirable consequences. If the clinician does not initiate a prognostic discussion, it is possible that the patient will not have the information to make fully informed medical decisions and may choose high-burden, low-benefit interventions, or fail to prepare for the final stage of life. If the clinician does initiate a prognosis discussion, the fear is that the relationship could be irreparably damaged.\nCase (b): Dr. Anna Simpson (Oncology) and Dr. Linda Hancock (Palliative Care) meet jointly with Dan Murphy to inform him that his scans revealed tumor progression. Dr. Simpson discusses the CT results clearly and recommends a new chemotherapy. Dan asks how many more chemotherapies are available to treat his disease. Dr. Simpson informs him that many other treatment options exist, however each with a smaller chance of response. Dan replies, ''Dr. Simpson, listen, I know this isn't good and that I won't live forever. I have done my will and everything but you have to figure out how I can see all my kids get into college. You can't let me die from this now.'' After the visit, the clinicians debrief. Linda Hancock (PC) reflects to Anna Simpson (Onc) that despite having given the CT results in a clear and empathic way, Dan was not able to tolerate the thought that his disease was incurable. Linda makes a mental note to re-assess Dan's self-assessment of his prognosis at the next palliative care visit.\nAt the next palliative care visit, Dr. Hancock asks Dan his thoughts about their last visit. He replies, ''Well.I was just glad to hear that there are many other treatment options available to me. You know I think Simpson is just really negative. I really think I will beat this thing.'' Linda Hancock notes to her self that Dan has incorrectly recalled the essence of the conversation she and Anna Simpson had with him and appears unable to contemplate anything but positive information. Linda wonders if Dan may be a patient for whom the cultivation of prognostic awareness is particularly challenging or if this is just a day when he needs to see only the positive.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A Normal Pattern: Coping That Swings between More and Less Realistic", "text": "The proposed approach to cultivating prognostic awareness is informed by Dr. Avery Weisman's observations of how patients cope with life-threatening illness. Weisman is a psychiatrist who studied hundreds of patients and observed their patterns of coping with terminal illness. A fundamental concept of his work is that denial is not a sign of unhealthy coping but rather a tool for patients to safely and slowly integrate the reality of death over time. 13 Unlike Kubler-Ross's 14 concept of coping with illness in which denial is an early stage and acceptance is a final stage, he observed that patients move in and out of both denial and acceptance of impending death frequently and often in one conversation. He calls this phenomenon ''middle knowledge.'' A patient with weeks to live may, for example, discuss his funeral and in the next moment describe his excitement over the birth of a grandchild who is due to be born in 6 months: ''I can't wait to hold that child!'' This can be incredibly confusing for the clinician who thought the THE CULTIVATION OF PROGNOSTIC AWARENESS 895 patient understood that his life expectancy was on the order of weeks and was even able to plan his funeral. Weisman believes that the patient may have the ability to integrate some aspects of his death but has not fully the integrated the loss he feels at not being able to meet this new grandchild. We conceptualize this normal coping as a swinging pendulum of awareness, from more integrated and realistic to less integrated and less realistic (Fig. 1). This kind of coping is not ''denial'' in its traditional sense, but rather a healthy, paced integration of information that, from the patient's perspective, would otherwise feel unimaginable.\nIn practice, patients frequently swing between a more and less realistic understanding. It is important for clinicians to tolerate this variability and remember that a patient's need to use denial as a coping mechanism changes over time. As the patient's disease progresses, and he or she has the opportunity to slowly explore the likely outcomes of the illness, expressions of middle knowledge often become less frequent. In the case, Linda Hancock as the palliative care clinician is early in her relationship with Dan and does not know whether his optimistic interpretation of the data is an example of middle knowledge or a sign that Dan will have difficulty cultivating prognostic awareness.\nIt is important to note that family members exhibit similar coping and this approach to cultivate prognostic awareness can be used with them as well. Family members with good prognostic awareness can promote prognostic awareness in the patient. If the key caregivers have low prognostic awareness, it can make the patient's coping and integration more challenging.\nOver time, our communication goal is to enable the patient and family to engage in discussions that more openly explore the likely course of the illness and to aid the patient in the psychological integration and stabilization of prognostic data. Patients who have integrated this difficult information can more effectively engage in shared medical decision making with their clinicians.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "A Communication Process for Cultivating Prognostic Awareness", "text": "Clinicians can help patients cultivate prognostic awareness by taking a step-wise and partnered approach. This approach begins with the clinician determining the likely prognosis, then assessing the patient's current understanding of the illness and inviting discussion of attainable hopes, and providing a place to grieve hopes that are likely unattainable. It is important to remember that the patient's current clinical status will be a critical factor in the timing of these discussions. The clinician's role is to help the patient understand how the likely clinical path maps onto the patient's hopes and goals. The clinician can help the patient understand both what is possible and what plans might need to be changed so the goal can be met.\nStep 0: Preparing: A subspecialist-level knowledge of prognosis Clinicians first need to prepare themselves with accurate information about the patient's likely life expectancy and the course of illness. The patient may prefer not to receive this information, but in order to accurately assess the patient's prognostic awareness the clinician should possess the most accurate information available.\nCase (c): Because Dr. Linda Hancock wants to be sure she has a subspecialist-level understanding of the patient's prognosis, she asks Dr. Anna Simpson for her best estimate of what she expects will happen with Dan's cancer. Anna reports that she thinks his survival is on the order of 6 to 9 months. Anna is worried that his extensive pleural-based disease will cause dyspnea that will adversely affect Dan's quality of life soon.\nStep 1: Assessing the patient's prognostic awareness: ''What's your sense of how you are doing?'' This self-assessment question offers a window into the patient's illness understanding and willingness to discuss the future. The patient's response can provide a useful guide (Fig. 2) for the discussion of prognosis. The response to this simple question often varies greatly. Patients may state emphatically, ''I am fine! I am fine!'' or quietly dissolve into tears as they express how worried they are about all that is happening. This patient self-assessment not only gives the clinician a sense of the patient's coping in the moment, but also often provides an FIG. 1. Model of coping with serious illness: a pendulum in which the patient's expressions swing through varying degrees of prognostic awareness. indication of the patient's readiness for discussions of prognosis. For example, the patient who is trying to convince the clinician that she is fine is giving clear cues that she is not ready to discuss weighty prognostic information.\nIn responding to the patient's self-assessment, clinicians have the opportunity to consciously model that discussion of prognostic information is something that is possible for both the clinician and the patient. When the clinician attends to the patient's cues and is able to sit with the patient's affect, patients often feel more in control and are empowered to ask for more detailed prognostic information on their own.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 2}, {"heading": "Case (d):", "text": "In her third palliative care appointment with Dan, Linda Hancock finds him appearing more ill. She asks several open-ended questions to assess Dan's illness understanding. ''How worried are you about what is going on right now?'' she asks. He responds, ''I am not that worried. I mean, don't get me wrong, I feel like crap but I am 54 years old. I don't really see how I can't bounce back from this.'' Linda then asks how his children are doing with him feeling so poorly. Dan becomes quiet and then after a bit of silence says, ''I guess that is the place I find it hard to just stay positive. It is hard to see them worried and if I am going to die from this like Simpson says, I will need to plan for the kids [pause]. I have to believe I will beat this!'' Linda notes to herself that he is vacillating between wanting only to discuss that he will be cured and preparing his children for his eventual death.\nStep 2: Inquiring whether the patient can imagine a poorer health state: ''What would it be like if you got sicker?'' When patients articulate only positive interpretations of their clinical status, one way that the clinician can test the patient's willingness to contemplate other interpretations is to ask the patient to imagine a poorer health state.\nA clinician may introduce the discussion in the following way, ''I know we are hoping that things will go well for a long time but I wonder if we should prepare in case things don't go as well as we hope. Do you ever imagine what it would be like if things did not go so well?'' This is a variation on the technique of hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. 15 Encouraging a patient to imagine a poorer health state is one step removed from the difficult reality. This exercise allows the clinician and the patient to partner in hope-based coping while beginning a discussion about goals and values in the event that what we are hoping for does not come to fruition.\nCase (e): Linda Hancock responds to Dan and asks, ''I hear that it sounds impossible to believe that you won't beat this. Is that right?'' He nods yes. Linda continues, ''I wonder if you ever have times when you find yourself imagining what it would be like if you did get sicker from this illness?'' Dan becomes very quiet and his eyes fill with tears. ''Yes at night when I can't sleep, I find my mind going there. I FIG. 2. The step-wise process to help patients cultivate prognostic awareness.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "THE CULTIVATION OF PROGNOSTIC AWARENESS 897", "text": "always stop myself and push it out of my mind. I have to be hopeful. It is the only way to beat this.'' Linda Hancock documents in her palliative care note that today Dan can articulate a deeper awareness of his prognosis as evidenced by his sadness at the thought of becoming sicker and his sense that he may need to prepare his children for his death. Linda notes to herself that Dan has partially integrated important prognostic information, and she believes he will be able to tolerate deeper conversations in future visits.\nStep 3:Judging patient readiness and clinical urgency: ''Do I need to discuss prognosis now?''\nIn this step, the clinician must consider the role that the patient's clinical status plays in the assessment of the patient's readiness.\n3a. For a patient who demonstrates readiness (regardless of clinical status): Indicate that you will discuss the information. Any patient who has asked for more detailed information about his or her prognosis should be given the information regardless of clinical status. When providing this information, it is again helpful for the clinician be aware of what the patient believes is likely to happen. It can be useful to ask, ''What is your body telling you?'' (Illustrated in case f below.) 3b. For a patient who is ambivalent or resistant and clinically stable: Hold off on giving the information and re-assess. If the patient is ambivalent or resistant but doing well clinically, the clinician may decide to repeat the selfassessment in an effort to help the patient become more comfortable with the discussion (Fig. 2). The goal is not to have the patient talk about difficult topics for the sake of talking about them but rather to be able to engage in more fully informed shared medical decision making. This is especially true in cultures where patients abdicate the role of decision making to a family member. We want to have either the patient or family member have the ability to engage in informed decision making, not to be forced to talk about prognosis when it is counter to the cultural norm. (Return to Step 1.) 3c. For a patient who is ambivalent or resistant and clinically declining: ''Name the dilemma.''. This approach will be illustrated in step 4b, but the next episode of the case will show how Dr. Hancock assesses readiness.\nCase (f ): At the next palliative care appointment, Linda Hancock remembers the last visit and asks Dan his thoughts about their last meeting. Dan says, ''You know I have been thinking more about what might happen if I get sicker. Do you really think that could happen? What would it look like? I mean I guess it is good to know how I would feel. I still find it hard to believe I will die from this.'' Although Dan has been resistant in the past, he is asking for prognostic information at the moment, so Linda interprets this as Dan exhibiting readiness and she decides to deliver the information. Dr. Hancock says, ''Dan, this is important, could we have a serious talk about this?'' He nods yes.\nStep 4: Delivering prognostic information tailored to patient readiness and clinical urgency 4a. For the patient who demonstrates a degree of readiness. When a clinician delivers prognostic information, Ask/Tell/Ask can be a useful approach. 16,17 This strategy allows the clinician to ask the patient what type of information he or she would find helpful. Some patients prefer to know the estimated life expectancy, whereas others would rather receive information about the likely functional disease trajectory. Asking the patient which type of information would be most useful can help set the stage for the conversation. After delivering the information, the clinician should check in with the patient to ensure that the question was answered satisfactorily.\nClinicians are often concerned that providing prognostic information will prevent patients from feeling hopeful about the future. Pairing hope and worry is a technique that facilitates the delivery of prognostic information in a kind way allowing the clinician and patient to maintain an optimistic stance. A clinician might say, ''I hope you do well for a long time, and I am also worried because the scans look so much worse.'' Patients feel supported when they believe that their clinicians want them to do well and hope that this will happen. Pairing hope and worry allows for clinicians to be honest about what they believe will happen clinically and also partner with the patient in hoping for a different outcome.\nAfter the clinician delivers prognostic information, he or she must be prepared for the patient's expression of emotion. The patient's display of emotion is a normal response to a conversation about prognosis. This is a critical juncture in the clinician's relationship with the patient in which the clinician needs the skill to tolerate the patient's emotion and not retract the information provided. The sadness or anger that often accompanies these conversations does not indicate that the clinician was not skillful but, more likely, that prognostic information was integrated on both a cognitive and emotional level.\nInstead of reassuring the patient or back-pedaling, the clinician must find a way to respond to the patient's emotion. The use of silence, empathic touch, re-statement of realistic hopes, and ''I wish'' statements can all be helpful in sitting with the patient's emotion. 18,19 Case (g): Because Dan has just said, ''I have been thinking more about what might happen if I get sicker. Do you really think that could happen?'', Linda Hancock decides to offer prognostic information to Dan. She asks, ''What specific information would be helpful to you? Just so I know, are you asking about the trajectory of illness in terms of your function or time?'' Dan looks very serious. ''I want to be able to plan how I will feel. I mean do I need to take a wheelchair on our summer vacation to the Grand Canyon? Just to be clear, I don't want anyone to tell me how long I have to live. I think I will just give up if I find out I only have a couple of months to live.'' Linda responds, ''Dan, I hope you will feel well enough to go on the family vacation, and also I worry that as the disease progresses your shortness of breath will also worsen, making a trip like going to the Grand Canyon a challenge.'' Dan starts to cry quietly. Linda consciously leaves a bit of silence. She waits until Dan looks up and then Linda says, ''It sounds like that was hard news to hear.'' He nods yes. Linda says, ''Dan, I really wish I had better news.'' He shakes his head, and says ''OK, doc.'' Linda decides that this is as much prognostic information as Dan can absorb today, and decides not to discuss code status. Linda documents in her palliative care clinic note that Dan is slowly integrating prognostic information about function. She notes that he is able to do this both emotionally and cognitively. She is feeling less worried about Dan and how he is navigating his illness. She documents Dan's prognostic awareness in her note so other collaborating clinicians can view her assessment.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "898", "text": "JACKSON ET AL.\n4b. For a patient who is ambivalent or resistant and clinically declining.\nCase (h): Three months later, Dan returns for another one of his regularly scheduled visits with oncology and palliative care. Prior to the visit, Anna Simpson finds Linda Hancock in the hallway and expresses her concerns. ''You know he is declining fast. His performance status is terrible. I don't want to give him more chemotherapy. I am afraid I will harm him, but I don't think that would go over well if I suggested it. I wish I could talk to him about the 'big picture' but he won't do it. He just gets angry with me. I really feel like I need to talk about his code status with him but how can I? He won't even let me talk about stopping the chemotherapy.'' Linda Hancock suggests that they meet together with him.\n''Naming the dilemma''\nIn this approach the clinician empathizes with the patient about how hard it is to discuss prognostic information but also articulates the disadvantages of avoiding it. The clinician can do this by saying, ''I hear that it is very hard for you to talk about the possibility that you might get sicker or even die from this illness. On the one hand, I don't want to do anything that would be upsetting, and on the other hand I feel like I won't be being a good doctor to you if we don't talk about the possibility that you might get sicker. Can we think together about a way to talk about this?'' Case (i): At the beginning of the joint visit, Linda Hancock asks Anna Simpson to lead. Anna asks Dan how he is feeling.

Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. Methods: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/ kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Results: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F 5,35 = 8.03, p = 0.002, g 2 = 0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F 5,35 = 14.275, p < 0.001, g 2 = 0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean D = 3.5, d = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-5.9, p = 0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean D = 2.4, d = 0.67, 95% CI = 1.0-3.7, p = 0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean D = 4.0, d = 1.34, 95% CI = 2.3-5.9, p = 0.001) and anxiety (mean D = 6.09, d = 1.34, 95% CI = 3.6-8.6, p < 0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. Conclusions: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted. The findings of the potential efficacy of oral ketamine for depression and the response of anxiety symptoms are novel. Further investigation with randomized, controlled clinical trials is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other subject populations.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P alliative care ''aims to relieve suffering and improve quality of life throughout the illness and bereavement experience, so that patients and families can realize their full potential to live even when they are dying.'' 1 Untreated psychiatric symptoms or syndromes, as sequelae of advanced, life-threatening illness or as preexisting conditions, stand in the way of this therapeutic aim.\nPsychiatric symptoms are prevalent in patients receiving hospice care. Up to 42% of hospice patients have symptoms of depression and up to 70% have symptoms of anxiety. [2][3][4] Depression and anxiety are frequently undertreated in these patients. Untreated psychiatric symptoms are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, even in this population of patients. 5 When untreated, these symptoms can also interfere with a patient's capacity to make decisions, understand their current medical situation, interact with caregivers, or ability to reach final goals. 6 Anxiety and depression may also severely impact quality of life 2,7 and are risk factors for suicidal behavior, 8 especially in the elderly. [9][10][11][12] Current standard pharmacologic treatments for depression in this population consist of the usual armamentarium of more than 24 antidepressants with at least 7 different mechanisms of action. 13 Many of these are also indicated for anxiety, as are other medications, all of which have significant associated risks. 14 An appropriate standard antidepressant trial is considered four to six weeks, and multiple trials are frequently necessary. 15,16 As the average time patients receive hospice care in the United States is less than 10 weeks and the median is less than 3 weeks, 17 current standards for antidepressant trials do not adequately address the needs of hospice patients suffering from depression and anxiety.\nThere is a growing body of literature supporting the rapid treatment of depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation, with intravenous (IV) ketamine. [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] Other than two case reports, [32][33][34] no studies to date have examined ketamine's role in treating depression or anxiety in the hospice population. To our knowledge, no investigations of depression treatment for any population have been carried out with oral ketamine, and only a couple investigations of ketamine have assessed symptoms of anxiety. 30,31 Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and is commonly used as an anesthetic agent. In subanesthetic doses it can also be given as an adjuvant to opiates for the treatment of cancer pain, particularly when opiates alone are ineffective. [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42] In addition to being a potent NMDA receptor channel blocker, ketamine has other actions, which may contribute to its analgesic and antidepressant effects. These include its interactions with other calcium and sodium channels, cholinergic transmission, noradrenergic and serotonergic reuptake inhibition, glutamate transmission, synapse formation, and l, d, , opioid-like effects. [43][44][45][46] Oral ketamine undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism mainly to norketamine (via CYP3A4). 47,48 Norketamine is about one-third as potent as parenteral ketamine for anesthesia; however, it is equipotent as an analgesic. The maximum blood concentration of norketamine is actually greater after oral administration than after parenteral administration. 49 Ketamine has a wide therapeutic range, making overdose difficult. Notably, anesthesia dosing is significantly higher than analgesia and depression dosing. Ketamine does have the potential to be abused at higher dosing ranges.\nOverall, ketamine has many properties that make it a good candidate for treating depression and anxiety, especially in patients receiving hospice care. It is inexpensive and easy to administer by multiple routes. It also has a rapid onset of action and minimal side effects when used at subanesthetic doses. Effectiveness and safety may improve with oral administration should ketamine's effects prove to be due, at least in part, to norketamine. 50 Significant literature supports its safe use in hospice patients for other symptoms, including pain. 36,37,40,41,[51][52][53][54][55][56] Presented are data from a 28-day, open-label, proof-ofconcept trial of daily oral ketamine administration with the objectives of evaluating and assessing the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care.", "n_publication_ref": 62, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Participants were male and female subjects, aged greater than 18 years, having a life limiting illness and receiving hospice care.

To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial, albeit open-label, wherein ketamine was used to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. It is also the first trial to demonstrate the use of oral ketamine administration targeting depression and to demonstrate ketamine's anxiolytic effects. It also adds to existing published data regarding use of repeated ketamine dosing.\nA significant improvement in depressive symptoms occurred with oral ketamine at a similar response rate (57%) to other published cases and studies (14%-85%), all of which utilized IV administration in patients with treatment resistant depression that were otherwise healthy; 66 however, unlike what was previously demonstrated, this effect was more protracted (occurring over weeks rather than in minutes) and more sustained than found with IV infusions of ketamine ( > 2 weeks). A significant novel finding was a decrease in symptoms of anxiety in 100% of the cases. Few adverse events or increases in somatic symptoms were noted, as has been the case in previously reported trials; in fact, in this study, all somatic symptoms significantly decreased. Also of note, no significant changes were noted in vital signs, cognition, suicide risk, or evidence of delirium. Interestingly, no changes in pain scores were found either, indicating that improvements in mood and anxiety were independent of the possible effects of ketamine on pain. However, not all subjects in the study had symptoms of pain to begin with. It was disappointing to not find changes in functional status or quality of life; however, given the small sample size and the limitations of the scales used to measure these important aspects, positive findings in these domains may be borne out in larger trials. Furthermore, clinical examinations revealed large changes in quality of life and functional status, even though this was not evident by results from the standardized measures. Some of the alternative findings versus IV administration may be due to 1) the oral dosing itself, which might provide similar antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and fewer adverse events than those of IV administration possibly due to first pass metabolism to norketamine or 2) due to differing bioavailablity via the different routes. 50 The more protracted time to response is disappointing, especially in this population, where time is of the essence. Still, the response rate and time to response is better than with standard antidepressant therapy. 15,16 In addition, the decreases in somatic symptoms are particularly interesting and important to this population that has significant medical illness and high symptom burden, as compared to subjects in other studies of ketamine for depression.\nThe positive findings with repeated oral dosing are very promising, as oral dosing is much more practical and less invasive than IV delivery. Placement of IV catheters requires skill, particularly in medically frail patients. Complications of catheters include malfunction, thrombosis, infection, and extravasation, all of which limit systemic access and increase the cost of care. [67][68][69] Furthermore, patients often endure multiple failed attempts at placement due to difficult venous access, FIG. 1.

In addition, IV catheter placement does not last for more than a few days.\nUtilizing an alternate route of administration of ketamine, such as the oral route, would be beneficial for all patients, especially those with serious medical illness. The ability to give repeated dosing and maintain a response over a long period of time is also of importance, which is more feasible with oral dosing. Perhaps a response may need to be induced with parenteral ketamine, which then could be maintained with oral dosing, though further study on route, dosing intervals, long-term efficacy, and side effects is needed. With these positive preliminary findings of potential efficacy for symptoms of both depression and anxiety, decreased somatic symptoms, high response rates, and rapid response in comparison with standard antidepressants, come some limi-tations. This was an open-label trial and is subject to all of the inherent biases in such trials. Subjects had either symptoms of depression or symptoms of depression mixed with symptoms of anxiety of unclear etiology. Also, as is often the case in clinical trials of this nature, especially in a medically ill population, the sample size is small. Furthermore, the sample comes from a fairly heterogeneous population of subjects receiving hospice care who have high medical comorbidity and high somatic symptom burden. Lastly, these subjects were recruited from a single site and the findings may not be generalizable.\nDespite its limitations, this open-label proof-of-concept trial suggests that daily oral ketamine may significantly decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients receiving hospice care with few adverse events. Further investigations   with randomized, controlled clinical trials are necessary to firmly establish the comparative effectiveness and safety of daily oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other patient populations. Quick acting, safe, and effective depression and anxiety treatments are needed in this population if a highquality end-of-life experience is to be achieved.

Methods: Our study was a review of published, peer-reviewed outcomes research, including both observational studies and controlled trials of nonhospice outpatient palliative care services. We assessed patient, family caregiver, and clinician satisfaction; clinical outcomes including symptom management, quality of life, and mortality; and heath care utilization outcomes including readmission rates, hospice use, and cost. Results: Four well-designed randomized interventions as well as a growing body of nonrandomized studies indicate that outpatient palliative care services can: 1) improve patient satisfaction, 2) improve symptom control and quality of life, 3) reduce health care utilization, and 4) lengthen survival in a population of lung cancer patients. Conclusions: The available evidence supports the ongoing expansion of innovative outpatient palliative care service models throughout the care continuum to all patients with serious illness.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "P alliative care programs have become widespread since 2000, mostly operationalized as hospital consultation services and inpatient units. With the growth of hospital services has come an increasing acceptance that palliative care is a care delivery model appropriate for all people with serious illness. Palliative care is now often defined as ''an extra layer of support.appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness.provided together with curative treatment.'' 1 This acceptance has been accompanied by a rapid growth of nonhospice, palliative care services in the outpatient sector. 2 With 85% of large U.S. hospitals already offering inpatient palliative care services, 3 ''outpatient palliative care'' is emerging as the key next step in service development. Nonhospice outpatient palliative care can be defined as including specialty consultations and co-management in clinics, homes, or residential living facilities. 4 Major professional medical organizations, including the Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization, the National Quality Forum, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Commission on Cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), and the American College of Chest Physicians, now call for improved palliative care services across the spectrum of care settings and diseases. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] Increasingly, recommendations are to integrate palliative care services into the routine care of patients with serious illness from the onset of a serious or lifelimiting disease. This vision of integrated disease and palliative care co-management is most clearly expressed in ASCO's provisional clinical opinion: ''combined standard oncology care and palliative care should be considered early in the course of illness for any patient with metastatic cancer and/or high symptom burden.'' 8,13 There is good evidence for the efficacy of inpatient palliative care in improving clinical care, patient and provider satisfaction, quality of life, and health care utilization. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Similarly, data support the quality of hospice care. [24][25][26] Although many of the documented palliative care benefits likely extend to the outpatient setting, the evidence for the efficacy of outpatient palliative care is less well known and has not been comprehensively reviewed. This report reviews the published data demonstrating the impact of nonhospice outpatient palliative care interventions. Such data can be used in defining areas of need for future research as well as in support of ongoing expansions nationally into outpatient palliative care.", "n_publication_ref": 27, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "A review of the literature was undertaken, guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations (www.prismastatement.org). The search strategy used the Medline and the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL) databases. Using Medical Subject Heading (MESH) terms and free text, keyword groups including ''palliative care,'' ''outpatient,'' ''home-based,'' ''community-based,'' ''clinic,'' ''supportive-care,'' and ''symptom management'' were combined in several ways. Inclusion criteria were: 1) primary studies reported in English, 2) studies using a randomized controlled trial design, and 3) studies reporting on impact of outpatient palliative care on quality of care, cost of care, and patient/ caregiver experience including quality of life and symptom burden. This search strategy yielded an insufficient number of manuscripts to move to a meta-analysis of data, thus the decision was made to present the existing evidence with a focus on a few sentinel articles. Data search was supplemented by a hand search of review articles, a search of grey literature, and personal contact with researchers who had published in outpatient palliative care to ensure that we had identified relevant sentinel articles.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Proposed benefits of outpatient palliative care", "text": "The calls for greater outpatient palliative care services make sense in light of the numerous theoretical benefits of moving palliative care ''upstream'' and into the community. Arguments for outpatient palliative care are made on epidemiological, clinical, and health care utilization bases. Benefits are identified for patients and families primarily, and for clinicians and the health care system at large secondarily.\nBenefits to patients and families. Although acute hospitalizations generate dramatic care needs, patients receive most of their care as outpatients. Based on data from the inpatient setting, it is presumed that outpatient palliative care can improve symptoms, satisfaction with care, and reduce unwanted health care utilization that does not match patientdefined goals. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Outpatient palliative care services may also offer patients and families the benefit of better quality of life for a longer period of time in that they increase the potential for symptom improvement with the added benefits that come from allowing palliative care interventions the time necessary to have their greatest effect, a common problem noted with late-referrals for hospice or inpatient palliative care services. Finally, there is a great potential for improved coordination of care, as care preferences are clarified earlier along with greater care continuity for patients across care settings.\nBenefits to clinicians. Current models of outpatient palliative care services that are integrated with oncology and other outpatient clinics indicate that the services are well accepted and provide support not only to the patient/family, but also to the referring clinician in terms of support for difficult decisions, assistance with challenging symptom management problems, and conflicts around goals of care. 27 Benefits to the health care system. As noted above, a central role of palliative care services is to match patient goals with appropriate use of medical interventions. Through the potential to get ''the right care to the right patients at the right time,'' efficiency in the health care system is improved. [20][21] Outpatient palliative care promises to help avert unnecessary and unwanted hospitalizations, readmissions, emergency room and intensive care unit visits, and to increase earlier hospice engagement. Such improved disease management can meet the needs of integrated health care systems and accountable care organizations to provide high-quality care and to avoid ineffective or unwanted care. In fact, there now appears to be a historic alignment of the clinical benefits of palliative care and the financial benefits of providing such care. 28 ", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Seminal outpatient research reports", "text": "The theoretical benefits outlined above are supported by expert consensus, extrapolation from the impact of inpatient palliative services, and a limited number of outpatient palliative care research studies. Although a number of important studies exist, the published literature does not yet include standard or comparable definitions of services, clinical structures, or clinical outcomes, making a formal meta-analysis or systematic review unfeasible. However, a descriptive summary of key studies appropriately describes the nascent research in outpatient palliative care. Four research trials of outpatient palliative care service have been selected for in-depth description below as they utilize a prospective, randomized, usual care control group methodology and are frequently cited as representing the strongest evidence of the benefits of outpatient palliative care (Table 1). Kaiser Permanente in-home palliative care. Brumley and colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente health system sought to evaluate whether in-home palliative care for terminally ill patients had an impact on patient satisfaction, place of death, and cost of care. 29,30 In this trial, 297 patients with late-stage congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer were recruited and randomly assigned to receive in-home palliative care services or usual care. Part of a community-based, integrated health system, the in-home palliative care intervention provided an interdisciplinary team approach similar to hospice but without limitations with regard to life expectancy or limitations on the pursuit of curative care. The team placed an emphasis on comfort-focused care and care coordination, and was directed by a palliative care physician. Members of the palliative care team, including physicians, conducted home visits and were available on-call. The intervention provided education and training including self-management skills to family caregivers.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IMPACT OF OUTPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE 1541", "text": "Patient satisfaction improved in the intervention group at both 30 days (odds ratio [OR] 3.37; p = 0.006) and at 90 days (OR = 3.37; p = 0.03).

Although home care visits and costs were increased, these costs were outweighed by savings from fewer physician office visits, emergency department visits, hospital days, and skilled nursing facility days, resulting in an overall 45% decrease in total care costs.\nThe Comprehensive Care Team. In the Comprehensive Care Team (CCT) project, Rabow and others assigned 90 patients with advanced CHF, COPD, or cancer referred from two primary care practices to receive an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention or usual primary care. 31,32 Life expectancy for eligible patients in this study was estimated between 1 and 5 years. In the intervention group, patients received integrated palliative care team consultation, including caregiver training, advance care planning, and psychosocial support.

In fact, PCPs rarely implemented the team's pharmacologic recommendations. Nevertheless, the palliative care intervention group had lower symptom burden for dyspnea ( p = 0.01) and anxiety ( p = 0.05), improved spiritual well-being ( p = 0.007), and sleep quality ( p = 0.05). There was no difference in depression, pain, quality of life, or satisfaction with care. Intervention arm participants had fewer primary care visits ( p = 0.03) and urgent care visits ( p = 0.04).

As a result of the palliative care intervention, patients reported increased satisfaction with family, PCPs, and the medical center generally.\nProject ENABLE. Bakitas et al. conducted the ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends) study between 2003 and 2008 in a rural New England National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. 33 Three hundred and twenty-two patients with advanced cancer were randomized to receive a multicomponent, psychoeducational intervention delivered by advanced practice nurses (APNs) consisting of four weekly educational sessions and monthly follow-up sessions until death (or study completion) or usual care. The intervention utilized a telephone-based format to improve access to palliative care in rural regions, and used a case management, educational strategy to enhance patient activation, self-management, and empowerment. Palliative care interventions included assessment using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer, symptom management recommendations, social support resources, and advance care planning. The study did not include evaluation by the specialist palliative care team unless requested by the intervention APN.\nThe primary outcomes of the intervention were impact on quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care [FACIT-Pal]), symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System [ESAS]), and resource use. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated positive impact on quality of life in the intervention group ( p = 0.02), lower depressive symptom burden on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) ( p = 0.02), and a trend toward lower symptom burden ( p = 0.06); there was no statistically significant differences on resource utilization.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The Temel study.

Among the 105 participants who died in the course of the study, participants in the intervention group were less likely to receive aggressive care at the end of life (chemotherapy within 2 weeks before death) or hospice admission within 3 days of dying, and were more likely to receive hospice care. Hospice costs increased, but these were more than outweighed by the cost savings associated with decreased chemotherapy and hospitalization in the last weeks of life. Estimates are that the early outpatient palliative care intervention saved $2,282 per patient overall. Participants in the intervention group had significantly longer survival than those in the usual care group (median survival 11.6 months versus 8.9 months; p = 0.02).", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Summary", "text": "Results from these four well-designed, prospective, controlled studies indicate that outpatient palliative care services can: 1) improve patient satisfaction, 2) improve symptom control and quality of life, 3) reduce health care utilization, and 4) lengthen survival in a population of lung cancer patients.

Listed below is a summary of other key research findings suggesting positive impacts from outpatient palliative.\nPatient, family, and clinician satisfaction. Supporting the findings in the studies above by Rabow and Brumley, multiple other studies in the United States and elsewhere have shown high satisfaction with outpatient palliative care services for patients in cancer centers, using validated survey instruments. [37][38][39][40] In a systematic review by Zimmermann et al. of randomized controlled trials of a variety of different palliative interventions, four outpatient programs measured satisfaction, with three demonstrating statistically significant improved patient satisfaction in the intervention groups. 19 Family caregivers report satisfaction, decreased caregiver burden, and fewer unmet needs when loved ones receive outpatient palliative care services. Family members of cancer patients receiving outpatient palliative care in a cancer center reported improved satisfaction one month after palliative care team consultation. 38 The Zimmermann review above showing improved patient satisfaction also documented improved family caregiver satisfaction in three of four outpatient controlled trials in various settings, including a nursing home, a home-based, and a coordinated inpatient/outpatient program. 19,41 A pediatric palliative care clinic demonstrated high satisfaction among the parents of patients. 42 Specialized palliative care services across a variety of settings, including outpatient services, were associated with caregivers reporting fewer unmet needs. 43 A randomized controlled study of 1544 RABOW ET AL.\noutpatient palliative care for patients with multiple sclerosis showed decreased caregiver burden in the intervention group. 44 Outpatient palliative care is also associated with improved satisfaction or other benefits among clinicians, including referring oncologists and the palliative care providers themselves. 27,45 Notably, outpatient palliative care may save referring clinicians time. In the study by Muir and colleagues of palliative care consultants embedded in oncology offices, estimates were that tasks performed by the palliative care consultants saved oncologists 170 minutes per referral over the course of the patient-oncologist relationship, or just over 4 weeks per year per participating practice (assuming the oncologists would have performed these duties themselves in the absence of the consultants). 27 Although palliative care teams can provide some of the care otherwise required of referring clinicians, there is also evidence that palliative care provides services in addition to and complementary with the focus of the referring physicians. 46 Improved symptom management and quality of life. Observational studies of symptom severity before and after outpatient palliative care consultation consistently demonstrate improvement associated with palliative care at both short (1 week), medium (1 month), and longer-term (12 weeks) follow-up. Improvements have been demonstrated in pain, depression, anxiety, dyspnea, sleep, quality of life, and well-being. 37,38,[47][48][49][50] Symptom and quality-of-life improvements have primarily been assessed in patients with cancer, however, improvements have also been seen in outpatient palliative care for chronic illnesses including advanced cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic/infectious, and neurologic illness. 44,[51][52][53] Improvements have been documented with outpatient palliative care in the Veterans Administration and in rural settings. 54,55 Mortality. In addition to the Temel study noted above, 34 a palliative care APRN pilot study using a comparative pre/ post-design reported on patient mortality. 56 This trial compared 49 patients with advanced cancer (stage III or IV) in a single community oncology setting with 52 who also received APRN assistance with pain and symptom control, education on medication adverse effects, psychosocial-spiritual support, and discussions on end-of-life preparation. The APRN was integrated into the oncology practice and had access to a palliative care consultation team. The intervention was associated with a significant decrease in the adjusted odds of being hospitalized (OR = 0.16; p < 0.01) and a significantly improved mortality rate (OR of being alive at 4 months = 24.64; p = 0.02).", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Impact on health care utilization and readmissions.", "text": "A central goal of palliative care is to better align patients' health care with their care preferences. As in the Brumley, Rabow, and Temel trials described above, numerous research studies now support the finding that outpatient palliative care is associated with changes in the use of health care resources, including decreased aggressive treatments at the end of life; decreased ambulatory, emergency, and hospital utilization; and increased hospice use.\nAmbulatory care utilization decreased in the Sutter Advance Illness Management (AIM) intervention. 57,58 The AIM project, highlighted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, is a systems-based model that provides assistance with care transitions from acute to end-of-life care, supports clarification of health care goals, and assists with home care and symptom management to address gaps in care for patients with late-stage chronic illness. The AIM intervention has been associated with a 52% decrease in physician visits and high patient and provider satisfaction. On the other hand, a recent meta-analysis of community specialist palliative care with home nursing was inconclusive about whether such services increased the rate of home deaths. 59 Although a randomized trial in Norway of palliative care coordination of community health care professionals did not show decreased hospitalization, 60 other research has found a decrease in health care utilization. The AIM project has reported a 54% decrease in hospitalization and an 80% decrease in intensive care unit days during the first 3 months following program enrollment. 57 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality highlights another palliative care innovation, by the Everett Clinic, whereby palliative care nurses monitoring frail elderly in primary care clinics noted a decrease in hospitalizations 60 days or less before death. 61 In the Optimizing Advanced Complex Illness Support (OACIS) project, comparing data during the 18 months before and following enrollment in a home-based palliative care intervention, although emergency room visits were no different, both the number of hospitalizations and the number of hospital days were reduced ( p = 0.000 for both analyses). 62 In other studies of emergency department use, long-term care residents with outpatient palliative care services 51 and primary care practice patients with the support of palliative care nurses were less likely to visit the emergency department. 63 Recent data have supported the expectation that outpatient palliative care services can result in decreased hospital readmission. Patients discharged with the support of outpatient palliative care services had decreased hospital readmissions. 64 In the OACIS project, the risk for 30-day hospital readmissions was significantly decreased following implementation of the home-based palliative care intervention (OR = 1.66; p = 0.02). 62 Coinciding with these documented changes in utilization of hospital services, nonhospice outpatient palliative care services are associated with increased and earlier hospice enrollment. 57 In the Temel study, patients receiving early palliative care had higher enrollment in hospice care for longer than 1 week (60.0% versus 33.3%; p = 0.004). 34 Reduced cost. Tied directly to the impacts on health care utilization are data demonstrating reduced total health care costs associated with outpatient palliative care. Outpatient palliative care services are ''high-touch,'' communication-rich, and staffing-intense services that are estimated to generate billing income slightly less that onehalf of their practice costs. 65 However, due to improved efficiency and appropriateness of overall health care utilization, total health care costs for patients receiving outpatient palliative care are decreased. Both the Brumley and the Temel studies demonstrated overall cost reduction in the setting of improved care. 30,36 As in the Muir study, when palliative care clinicians perform some of the clinical care duties for complex, ill patients, other specialists may save time and be able to perform other billable services. But, beyond this theoretical efficiency,", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IMPACT OF OUTPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE 1545", "text": "numerous trials have shown overall total health care cost savings with outpatient palliative care. As early as 1999, a trial of hospice consultation for prostate cancer patients receiving palliative chemotherapy showed decreased costs in the intervention group. 66 In the Sutter AIM intervention, average savings per enrollee are reported to be $213 per month. 57 In early palliative care for patients with multiple sclerosis, average costs, including inpatient care and informal care were \u00a31,789 lower. 67 In the OACIS project of home-based palliative care, adjusting to exclude outliers, total and variable hospital costs were decreased from $23,386 to $16,467 and from $10,937 and $7,537, respectively (p = 0.000 for both analyses). 62 On balance, whereas some costs are increased for patients receiving outpatient palliative care (e.g., home care or hospice costs), more expensive interventions are avoided leading to overall health care savings. Such savings are especially important in systems of shared cost/risk, integrated health systems, and accountable care organizations.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "The scope of palliative care services is rapidly evolving. What started in the United States largely as hospital-based care in the early 1990s is evolving so that palliative care principles and practices are being integrated across the broader landscape of health care settings. A new emphasis on interdisciplinary patient-centered care, a shift in health care reimbursement from fee-for-service to capitated models, the growing research base documenting benefits of palliative care services, national consensus recommendations, and the dramatic expansion of specialist palliative care providers, are all playing a role in the push to increase outpatient services.\nWith the expansion of outpatient palliative care services comes the responsibility to carefully define clinical, customer, and health care utilization outcomes so that expectations for new service providers, and their funders, are appropriately matched. Compared with the growing literature base of hospital palliative care services, research on outpatient outcomes is quite small. However, the existing data presented in this report do support the hypothesis that outpatient palliative care services can promote improved patient, family, and clinician satisfaction, patient symptoms, and efficiency of health care utilization, thereby reducing total health care costs. Outpatient palliative care functions concurrently with ongoing disease management, offering added value to usual care, 46,68 and is instrumental at helping interested patients transition away from curative care approaches as the end-oflife draws near. 57 Clearly, there are limitations to the available data. Research methods are inconsistent, making summary of disparate studies difficult. Two prior reviews of palliative interventions and services across multiple settings have recognized this. 19,22 Most of the studies of outpatient palliative care are limited to adult patients with cancer. Studies often use nonuniform definitions of what constitutes outpatient palliative care and nonuniform outcome measures. Notably, much of the data are observational, but several randomized trials have provided pivotal support. Clinic-based and home-based palliative care have been studied most commonly, with scarce research into palliative care provided in the long-term care setting. 69 More research is needed, especially to replicate early findings of improved mortality with outpatient palliative care, to identify which elements of palliative care are responsible for the documented outcomes, to detail the elements of a sustainable financial model for widespread use of outpatient palliative care, and to develop process steps to identify appropriate patient populations.\nNevertheless, in light of the historic alignment of clinical and health care financing goals, 28 the available evidence supports the ongoing expansion of new service models throughout the care continuum, the expansion of outpatient palliative care services to all patients with serious illness, and the full integration of palliative care services across the continuum of care. 70 Nationally, payors and large health systems have become interested in exploring the potential benefits of expanded outpatient palliative care services. 28 Unfortunately, current assessments in the United States suggest that the outpatient palliative care capacity to meet this burgeoning demand is severely limited. 65,[71][72][73] Having demonstrated the benefits of outpatient palliative care, developing and staffing adequate services to provide this care is the next urgent goal alongside continued research to explore a new set of operational questions: What is the optimal staffing paradigm for different nonhospital settings that promotes quality and efficient care? What is the right balance of utilizing palliative care specialists versus improved training at the generalist palliative care level? What is the optimum role of the palliative care specialist in terms of providing longitudinal services versus serving purely in a consultant role?

This systematic review summarizes these studies and their outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CI-NAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science; performed a search of articles published by opinion leaders in the field; and reviewed hand-search articles as of August 13, 2012. The terms ''palliative care'' and ''intensive care unit'' were mapped to MeSH subject headings and ''exploded.'' We included trials of adult patients that evaluated an ICU intervention and addressed Robert Wood Johnson group-identified domains of high-quality end-of-life care in the ICU. We excluded case series, editorials, and review articles. We compared two types of interventions, integrative and consultative, focusing on the outcomes of patient and family satisfaction, mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), because these were most prevalent among studies. Results: Our search strategy yielded 3328 references, of which we included 37 publications detailing 30 unique interventions. Interventions and outcome measures were heterogeneous, and many studies were underpowered and/or subject to multiple biases. Most of the interventions resulted in a decrease in hospital and ICU LOS. Few interventions significantly affected satisfaction. With one exception, the interventions decreased or had no effect on mortality. There was no evidence of harm from any intervention. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of interventions made comparison of ICU-based palliative care interventions difficult. However, existing evidence suggests proactive palliative care in the ICU, using either consultative or integrative palliative care interventions, decrease hospital and ICU LOS, do not affect satisfaction, and either decrease or do not affect mortality.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T wenty percent of people in the United States die either in an intensive care unit (ICU) or shortly after ICU admission. 1 Although the use of hospice at the time of death has increased over the last decade, so also has the use of ICU services in the last month of life. 2 Thus, ICUs are critically important locations for providing effective, high-quality endof-life and palliative care.\nPatients in an ICU have a high symptom burden and frequently experience functional impairments both in the ICU and after discharge. Evidence shows that patients experience difficulty communicating, pain, dyspnea, hunger, and drowsiness while in the ICU. [3][4][5] Following ICU discharge, these patients often have poor health-related quality of life with significant functional limitations and higher mortality. [6][7][8][9] The term ''post-intensive care syndrome'' refers to a constellation of impairments in both ICU survivors and their family members including persistent physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments in survivors and psychological impairments in family members of ICU patients. 10 Thus, providing effective and high-quality palliative care to improve end-of-life care and to better mitigate shortand long-term physical and psychological burdens and functional impairments has the potential to benefit all ICU patients and their families.\nThe literature includes several consensus statements and professional society clinical guidelines recommending ways to improve the delivery of palliative care in the ICU. [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Included in these guidelines are recommendations for patient-and family-centered care and shared decision making. A consensus group, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, included seven domains for equality care in the ICU 15 and these include: (1) patient-and family-centered decision making, (2) communication, (3) continuity of care, (4) emotional and practical support of patients and families, (5) symptom management and comfort care, (6) spiritual support, and (7) emotional and organizational support for ICU clinicians. Of note, all of these domains are inherent to palliative care and are likely to benefit both dying and surviving ICU patients and their families.\nInterventions to improve palliative medicine in the ICU have been evaluated by two recent literature reviews. The first was a systematic review by Scheuneman and colleagues, which included a search of the literature from 1995 to 2010 using MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Cochrane, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. 18 However, the search included only communication-related interventions. The second review was conducted by the Improving Palliative Care in the ICU (IPAL-ICU) consensus group. 19 This review was not systematic and included only the MEDLINE database. The IPAL-ICU group suggested that the type of palliative care intervention-integrated into standard ICU care, consultative to that care, or a combination of both-might impact efficacy. 19 To capture articles published prior to 1995, to include interventions that involve palliative medicine related concepts beyond communication, to search a wider breadth of databases, and to contrast the efficacy of consultative versus integrative interventions, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence-based interventions that improve the delivery of palliative care in the adult ICU. To more clearly interpret the data, we further defined ''integrative'' and ''consultative'' into two mutually exclusive categories and thus eliminated designation of an intervention as ''both.''", "n_publication_ref": 22, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The systematic review", "text": "We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence-based interventions that improve the delivery of palliative care in the adult ICU.

''Consultative'' described an intervention that enabled a non-ICU person-one who would not otherwise be involved in ICU patient care-to interact with the patient and/or patient family. ''Integrative'' described an intervention that only had ICU personnel interacting with patients and families. Interventions involving palliative care or ethics consults were classified as consultative. Interventions were classified as integrative that involved (1) a non-ICU clinician teaching ICU personnel how to better provide palliative care, (2) an order set or standardized pamphlet for families, and/or (3) standardization or triggering of ICU family meetings. For clarity, we made these definitions mutually exclusive, thus avoiding the concept of a ''mixed intervention.''

Interventions also improved the quality, quantity, and content of communication and decreased symptoms of distress and anxiety in family members. Interventions also decreased the use of procedures and decreased the time between admission and comfort measures only, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, and do-not-resuscitate orders. We found no evidence of harm in any study.\nThe consultative group had a higher percentage of participants with a decrease in hospital and ICU LOS than the integrative group. However, because of the heterogeneity in design and outcome measures, it is impossible to infer that one is superior to the other. Several of the studies did not measure LOS, and it is possible that these interventions would have had an impact on LOS, if it had been measured. Several of the integrative interventions did show a decrease in LOS 25,28,34 as well as improvement in other equally important outcomes (such as family anxiety and distress).\nTwo of the integrative studies 30,42 were completed in France, where, at the time of the intervention, ICU attending physicians did not routinely involve the family members in the decision to withdraw life support. 42,60 Thus, these interventions were targeted at family member anxiety and distress rather than LOS. Only one of the French studies measured ICU LOS and found no change. 42 Both French trials were well conducted, high-quality studies with significant findings, published in high-impact journals. Cultural differences present a challenge to the generalizability of these findings to the United States, where decision making is shared and interventions are expected to also have an effect on health care utilization and cost. However, the impact of these interventions on the well-being of family members is important.\nNeither the integrative nor the consultative interventions appeared to impact family member satisfaction. The reasons for this apparent lack of effect are multifaceted. Firstly, baseline family satisfaction is relatively high (approximately 70%); only large studies would be powered to detect statistically significant changes, particularly if effect size is small. This ceiling effect could be a result of metrics that are not sensitive or calibrated to actual family satisfaction. Further, regardless of whether a patient actually receives ''good'' care (however that might be defined), patients and families might be invested in believing that they receive ''good'' care and reticent to criticize caregivers-if stranded in an allegorical lifeboat with few to no alternative options, patients and families may be understandably slow to question whether the boat is sound or the boat's crew seaworthy. In addition, because patients and families might only experience one ICU, they may be ill equipped to give informed appraisals that inherently involve comparison or evaluation of ICU quality. It is also possible that patients and families are educated consumers aware of all potential possibilities for ICU care and are still highly satisfied with the delivered care. Ultimately, satisfaction is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon that is difficult to meaningfully measure and interpret One might expect that proactive palliative care in the ICU would increase mortality by potentially causing patients and/ or family members to value ''comfort over cure'' and choose noncurative, life-limiting care options. In our experience, this preconception tends to delay consulting a palliative care professional, because the ICU provider notes he or she is not yet ready to ''give up'' or to ''send that message'' to the patient and family. However, the evidence does not support this preconception. The reviewed studies found that palliative care in the ICU was not associated with an increased likeli-hood of patient death or with any other harm. Rather, the literature demonstrates that better palliative care in the ICU benefits patients, families, and health care systems without increasing mortality.\nAlthough consultative interventions appeared to be more efficacious in reducing ICU and hospital LOS, each approach has benefits and drawbacks. Integrative interventions inherently involve extra duties allocated to ICU teams, who already balance multiple tasks imperative to safe and effective ICU care. Adding more, often time-intensive, tasks (such as communication exploring patient and family care goals) may be burdensome. In contrast, a consultative approach allows one provider or provider group to deliver standardized and/or evidence-based palliative care. Consultative approaches might be especially effective in ICUs with open or semi-open administration models, where integrative approaches must involve training of multiple providers of disparate disciplines and specialties. The drawback to the consultative approach is that it requires hiring, training, and paying new personnel for whom reimbursement may not cover expenses. 61 Thus, as ICU leaders and policy makers plan potential future interventions, the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches should be considered.", "n_publication_ref": 9, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "Threats to validity and limitations of this systematic review include that the title, abstract, and study screening were completed by a single author (RA), and thus we cannot assess kappa or inter-reviewer reliability of study selection. In addition, the rationale for exclusion of each article was not specifically tracked and counted. As mentioned, there are also potential gaps in the search strategy because of immature MeSH terms, although the authors attempted to counteract this through the use of the ancillary search strategy. Moreover, lacking prior precedent, the definitions of consultative and integrative were formalized by study authors; their generalizability and utility are untested and unclear.

By definition, such a trial would utilize meaningful, multifaceted outcomes; stakeholders are not likely to value an intervention that decreased ICU LOS while concurrently increasing patient suffering or family anxiety levels. As exemplified by the diversity and heterogeneity of the outcomes in previously published studies (see Appendix 3), such meaningful, multifaceted palliative care related outcomes do not currently exist, and the development and validation of such metrics is a critical area for future research. 62 Future ICU-based palliative care studies should also incorporate patient-centered outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and symptom scores, to ensure that interventions are reducing suffering (the core mission of palliative care) and meaningfully impacting patient and family experience. Finally, good palliative care requires that the care provided enables a patient and their family to set meaningful, and obtainable, health care related goals.

Economic evaluation is essential to validate current provision and assess the case for new programs. Previous economic reviews in palliative care reported on programs across settings and systems; none has examined specifically the hospital consultative model, the dominant model of provision in the United States. Objectives: To review systematically the economic evidence on specialist palliative care consultation teams in the hospital setting, to appraise this evidence critically, and to identify areas for future research in this field. Data Sources: A meta-review (''a review of existing reviews'') was conducted of eight published systematic reviews and one relevant nonsystematic review. To identify articles published outside of the timeframe of these reviews, systematic searches were performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit databases. Study Selection: Articles were included if they compared the costs and/or cost effectiveness of a specialist hospital inpatient palliative care consultation for adult patients with those of a comparator. Results: Ten studies were included and these demonstrate a clear pattern of cost-saving impact from inpatient consultation programs. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps still exist regarding the economic effects of these programs. Current evidence has been generated from the hospital perspective; health system costs, patient and caregiver costs, and health outcomes are typically not included. Conclusions: Inpatient palliative care consultation programs have been shown to save hospitals money and to provide improved care to patients with serious illness. With a clear pattern of cost-saving using current methodology, it is timely to begin expanding the scope of economic evaluation in this field. Future research must address the measurement of both costs and outcomes to understand more fully the role that palliative care plays in enhancing value in health care. Relevant domains for such research are identified.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "M aintaining the recent expansion of palliative care access in the United States is a recognized public health concern, both to address insufficient provision in underserved regions and to develop national capacity in the context of aging populations and changing patterns of disease. [1][2][3][4][5] Evidence-based research is required, systematically appraising the outcomes of programs and identifying the key processes and structures underpinning these outcomes. [6][7][8] Payers and policymakers require evidence to validate current palliative care provision, to explore ways that this could be made more cost effective, and to assess the case for new programs. 9 One essential component of such a research agenda is economic evaluation. Patients with serious illness and functional impairment account for a rapidly increasing share of medical expenditures in the United States and other highincome countries. 5 Cost-effectiveness analysis of care provided to people with serious illness has been identified as fundamental to controlling long-term costs. 10 Despite the acknowledged significance of economic analyses in evaluating and informing care provision, the economic literature on programs is small and disparate, reflecting the complexity of palliative care assessment. 11 Where the clinical and economic impact of palliative care programs have been analyzed in previous systematic reviews, these have tended to report across different settings, diagnoses, levels of specialism, and national systems, highlighting patterns without focusing on specific programs or models of care. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] There has been no economic review focused on specialist hospital inpatient consultation, the dominant model of provision in the United States hospital setting. Nonspecific approaches have been logical given the disparate and formative nature of economic evaluation in palliative care. But as the numbers of programs and of evaluations grow, so does the need for more focused analysis. A review was therefore undertaken to collect systematically the economic evidence on this model specifically, to appraise critically the evidence, and to identify areas for future research in the field.", "n_publication_ref": 20, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "Identifying studies for consideration in our review was performed primarily by systematic meta-review (''a review of existing reviews''); instead of collating studies from databases, researchers considered studies included in already published reviews. For time periods not covered by already published reviews, a systematic database search was undertaken.\nThis was agreed among the authors as an appropriate method given the prior literature and our objectives. In the context of multiple relevant prior reviews, we did not feel that a full systematic review was justified: broadly considered, the economic evidence on palliative care programs has been assembled. What the prior reviews do not provide is a detailed examination of the economic evidence on any specific model of care delivery, or a critical assessment of that evidence. In systematically reviewing relevant previous reviews using clear criteria focusing specifically on economic evaluation of one model, we provide meaningful information that can guide decision making-the primary purpose of a systematic literature review in health care. 20 Formal metaanalysis combining these results using statistical modeling is precluded by persistent differences in methods and approach in economic studies of palliative care. 19 Reviews were identified by systematic searches on the PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit databases. Relevant search terms for palliative care, review, and economics (e.g., palliative, hospice; review, systematic; economic*, cost*) were combined to search titles, abstract, and subject headings to July 31, 2013. A review was included the meta-review only if it reported (1) a systematic search strategy, (2) examining (but not necessarily limited to) inpatient hospital palliative care programs, (3) treating adult patients, and (4) identified outcomes of interest as including (but not necessarily limited to) economic analysis. Only English-language journal articles were considered.\nThe meta-review returned nine published reviews with a relevant focus, [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]21 summarized in Table 1.\nOf these, eight systematic reviews variously focused primarily or exclusively on economic factors in palliative care provision 13,17,19 ; reported economic impact as one outcome of interest separately alongside clinical and other factors 14,15 ; or evaluated palliative care services without particular emphasis on economic considerations. 12,16,18 An additional review, not reporting a systematic search strategy but with a highly relevant focus, was included in the meta-review following discussion among the authors. 21 The reviews had a balance between different systems and perspectives in highincome countries with four written by teams based in the United Kingdom, [12][13][14]16 three in the United States, 15,18,21 and one each from Belgium 17 and Ireland. 19 The timeframe of these nine reviews provided full coverage of the relevant published literature to the end of 2011. To supplement these findings and identify papers published since 2011, systematic searches were performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and EconLit databases.

Six of the 10 evaluations were described as comprising at least a physician, a nurse, a social worker, and a chaplain [23][24][25][26][27][28] ; in some cases these were also described as including a psychologist and/or an oncology nurse specialist and/or nursing assistants. Of the other 4, 2 were multisite studies in which all teams included a physician and nurse but not all included a social worker and chaplain, 29,31 and another assessed a newly implemented service that initially comprised a physician and nurse before later incorporating a chaplain. 33 The specific composition of the team was not described in one study, 30 but is indicated to be consistent with a prior related study. 24 A further source of potential variability between studies is the process and nature of referral.

In assessing current provision and validating new programs, payers and policymakers are not only concerned with the immediate direct costs of providing hospital treatment. Specifically, questions remain as to whether reductions in hospital costs are passed on to other care settings or to family or informal caregivers, the effect of palliative care teams on hospice expenditures, and the effect of palliative care teams on overall health care expenditures. 34,35 And ensuring that cost reduction does not reflect reduced quality of care is best achieved by a full costeffectiveness analysis quantifying the relationship between cost effects and treatment efficacy. 34 ", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Knowledge gaps", "text": "From first principles, cost-effectiveness analysis in health care is defined as a ''comparative analysis of alternatives in terms of both costs and consequences.'' 22 With regard to costs, the focus has been on the hospital ''silo.''

The improvement of economic evaluation of palliative care teams requires that evaluators identify a greater proportion of relevant components in a full cost-effectiveness analysis, establish what is already known about these through existing datasets and published research, and considers the best way to measure and incorporate these in future.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Components of cost analysis", "text": "There are four major categories of resource use for costeffectiveness analysis (CEA), summarized in Table 3. 35 As this summary makes clear, current economic evaluation has excluded key components of the cost effects of palliative care teams. Increasing the scope and thus reliability of economic evaluation of palliative care teams requires addressing these shortfalls.\nFirst, future studies need to expand their perspective in examining health care resources beyond the perspective of direct hospital costs. These studies need to incorporate all relevant health care costs paid by patients, their families, and other payers, including pharmacy, and formal caregivers, and incorporate all disease-relevant system costs (''total spend'') following the initial intervention, both to hospitals and the health system, and to patients, families, and other payers.\nA full cost-effectiveness analysis would examine and incorporate non-health care system costs, such as hours lost from work, caregiver comorbidity, financial consequences of serious illness to families, and patient and family caregiver time. As our review shows, no evaluation of in-hospital consultation teams has included these costs. Given the lack of routine data collection in these domains, addressing these knowledge deficits may be best addressed by future primary research incorporating these domains in design.\nWhere future analysis remains focused on cost from the hospital perspective, our review highlights two particular priorities. First, studies to date have not analyzed in detail patient-level determinants of resource use. But factors such as socioeconomic status, functionality, and diagnosis may determine a high proportion of hospital costs in providing care to patients with serious illness. 17,36,37 Identifying relevant patient-level factors may offer new and valuable information for understanding variations in cost and so delivering care that is both more appropriate to patient needs and less resource-intensive. However, few studies in any setting have attempted this. 38,39 Second, the literature to date is skewed toward patients near end of life; as palliative treatment is increasingly introduced earlier in the care trajectory, it is important to develop evidence on treatment effects for patient groups with longer life expectancy at the time of consultation.\nFuture analysis will also be helped by more detailed cost reporting. Recent studies have tended to report both direct and total costs, per diem and in toto. This approach, alongside a definition of what each category comprises and how the figures were reached, is the best way to enable formal comparison and statistical analysis of results in future as well as to improve understanding of the data under discussion.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Approaches to estimating effectiveness", "text": "There is no consensus on methodology for measuring effectiveness in the economic evaluation of palliative care.\nStandardized guidelines for health economics research in the United States identify the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the fundamental outcome measurement for all evaluations. 35 However, equivalent guidelines specifically for palliative care have resisted this position. 8,40 The QALY approach has been criticized as inappropriate for patients with serious illness and is an ongoing subject of debate among economists in this field. [41][42][43] Evaluators must make their own decision in research design to identify the contextually appropriate measures of physiological and health-related quality of life (HRQL) effects to be incorporated in cost-effectiveness analysis. Given the emerging state of the field, initial approaches do not need to be methodologically complex to make a substantial contribution. An example of a simple approach was illustrated in a U.K. study of short-term palliative care for multiple sclerosis. 44 The authors generated two cost-effectiveness planes, plotting the relationship of costs with patient outcomes (as measured by Palliative Care Outcome Scale [POS]-8) and caregiver burden (using Zaret Caregiver Burden [ZBI]-12).\nIn combining cost and effectiveness analysis for the same patient group the authors present more thorough and robust evidence to compare the impact of an intervention and a Informal caregiver time costs were not included in the evaluations of palliative care teams to date.

Over the next two decades the growth in the proportion of minority older adults will substantially outpace that of Non-Hispanic whites. Specifically, the population of older Non-Hispanic whites is expected to increase by only 59% compared to 160% for older minorities-202% for Hispanics, 114% for African Americans, 145% for American Indians, and 145% for Asians and Pacific Islanders. 1 Given the influence of cultural beliefs and preferences on the experience of serious illness and death, [2][3][4] and the disproportionate burden of pain, 5 disability, 1,6 and advanced disease 1,[7][8][9] among some minority groups, research aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in palliative care is essential. As the evidence base for the benefits of palliative care continues to grow [10][11][12][13][14] it is imperative that these services are equally accessible, of similar quality, and meet the needs of older adults of all races and ethnicities.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Available Evidence on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Palliative Care", "text": "Broadly defined, disparities in health care are differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, quality of care, and access to care that exist across racial and ethnic groups. Health care disparities are widely documented for African Americans and Hispanics compared to whites across a range of diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. [7][8][9] While much of the research in this area has focused on disease prevention, early diagnosis, and curative treatment, there is growing evidence that racial and ethnic disparities also exist in access to palliative care and in clinical outcomes such as symptom management and communication. 5,15,16 As in other areas of disparities research, the body of work in palliative care has largely focused on differences between whites and African Americans, and to a lesser extent, Hispanics. The discussion below mirrors this tendency, but also includes what is known about disparities related to other minority groups when data are available.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Disparities in the Quality of Care", "text": "A number of studies document lower-quality palliative care for minorities across multiple domains, including satisfaction, communication, and pain management. In a national survey of bereaved family members, surrogates of African Americans were less satisfied with the quality of end-of-life care and more often reported concerns about provider communication. 15 Similarly in other studies, compared to whites, African Americans report less satisfaction with the quality of communication, including the extent to which providers listen and share information, with greater disparities in racially discordant patient-provider relationships. 17,18 Further, there is evidence from a prospective study of cancer patients that outcomes of communication differ by race, with end-of-life discussions between physicians and their African American (versus white) patients less likely to result in care consistent with patient preferences. 16 A large body of research documents disparities in the assessment and treatment of pain for African Americans and Hispanics versus whites across age groups, diagnoses, and settings, with similar trends for Asians and Native Americans in nursing homes. Also, minorities face challenges in access to pain medicines, as pharmacies in some predominantly minority neighborhoods are less likely to stock adequate supplies of opioids. 5,19 Other research on disparities in outcomes of care for seriously ill patients has examined differences in the intensiveness of care and documentation of treatment preferences. Compared to whites, minorities are more likely to die in the hospital, and African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to be hospitalized and to receive intensive aggressive care in the last six months of life. 20,21 While there are some inconsistencies, in most studies, compared to whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians are less knowledgeable about advance directives and less likely to complete them. [22][23][24] Disparities in the Use of Palliative Care Services Studies consistently document lower rates of hospice use for minority older adults than for whites across diagnoses, geographic areas, and settings of care, including nursing homes. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31] Among Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2010, 45.8% of whites used hospice compared to 34% of African Americans, 37% of Hispanics, 28.1% of Asian Americans, and 30.6% of Native North Americans. 32 Data on disparities in the experiences of minority hospice enrollees are limited. There is some evidence that disparities in the quality of care are smaller between whites and African Americans enrolled in hospice compared to those in the general population. 33 Other studies document higher rates of hospice disenrollment for African Americans than whites and more concerns about care coordination and quality among hospices with a higher proportion of African American enrollees. [34][35][36] Overall, hospice lengths of stay tend to be similar across racial and ethnic groups or longer for minorities than whites. 34,37,38 Research is minimal on disparities in the use of nonhospicebased palliative care. Small studies of home-based palliative care and inpatient palliative care consultation have reported favorable outcomes for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders, including increased satisfaction, greater rates of home deaths and hospice referrals, and increased documentation of treatment preferences. [39][40][41][42] In contrast, a single study of cancer patients at a supportive care clinic found persistent disparities in symptom burden, with Hispanics and African Americans less likely than whites to report improvement in pain or fatigue at follow-up. 43 ", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Factors Contributing to Disparities in Palliative Care and Interventions", "text": "Factors contributing to disparities in the use of palliative care are not well understood. Research in this area has focused on racial and ethnic differences in knowledge, cultural beliefs, and treatment preferences as barriers to the use of palliative care. Studies document a disproportionate gap in knowledge about palliative care among minority older adults. [44][45][46][47][48] Other research suggests that among African Americans in particular, spiritual and religious beliefs may conflict with the goals of palliative care, and mistrust of the health care system due to past injustices in research and ongoing disparities may lead to concerns about forgoing curative care as required by the Medicare Hospice Benefit. 49,50 Further, studies consistently document greater preference for life-sustaining therapies regardless of prognosis among African Americans and Hispanics compared to whites, while preferences for Asians vary with acculturation. 3,22,51 However, research suggests that among African Americans with advanced cancer stated preferences for care are not consistently related to actual treatment received. 16 Other cultural beliefs that may present a barrier to the use of palliative care include less positive attitudes toward disclosure of terminal illness among Asians and Hispanics. 22 While empiric research is minimal, potential organizational barriers to the use of palliative care by racial and ethnic minorities include the absence of minority staff, interpreters, and community outreach to diverse communities. 52,53 There are few studies of interventions to reduce disparities. Research has included the development of culturally competent hospice educational materials, 54 videos to improve health literacy, 55,56 and patient navigation to address disparities in care for African Americans and Latinos. 57 Other work has examined how peer support can extend care to African Americans with advanced cancer. 58 ", "n_publication_ref": 19, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Content and Methodological Gaps", "text": "Although there is increasing interest in disparities in palliative care, the overall body of research is narrow in focus. There are limitations and gaps in which groups have been studied, what has been studied, and how the research has been conducted.\nAs in research in health care disparities in general, studies in disparities in palliative care have largely focused on African Americans and to a lesser extent Hispanics, the two largest minority groups; there are considerably fewer studies that include other minorities. Additionally, cancer patients, often in outpatient settings, are relatively well represented in the current literature, while there is less research examining disparities in palliative care for minority older adults with other highly prevalent conditions, such as heart failure or dementia, or across care settings, such as nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Despite the importance of informal caregivers in assisting with decision making and providing care, particularly for minority older adults, there is little research examining disparities in their experience.\nAlthough there is a sizable body of literature documenting disparities in hospice enrollment, data on racial and ethnic disparities in access to and use of nonhospice-based palliative care are lacking. There are few studies examining disparities in quality (e.g. symptom management, psychosocial support) for those receiving hospice or nonhospice-based palliative care. There are even fewer studies examining potential determinants of disparities or variability within rather than between racial and ethnic groups. That is, little research has attempted to identify moderators and mediators of disparities among patients (e.g., health literacy, socioeconomic status); providers (e.g., communication skills); organizations (community partnerships); or regions (supply of other health care resources). Studies of the rigorous development and testing of interventions with measurement of outcomes, such as reduced disparities or improved quality, are also absent.\nThere are significant methodological limitations in the published work. The most commonly used methods include small to large secondary data analyses, retrospective studies of surrogates, qualitative studies of patients' beliefs and preferences, cross-sectional analyses of small convenience samples, and surveys with investigator-developed measures, often with little validation in minority groups. Many studies do not report race and ethnicity discretely and include only a small number of minority older adults and so have inadequate power to examine differences in outcomes by age ( \u2021 65 versus < 65) and race or ethnicity. While plentiful, studies examining cultural beliefs and preferences that may impact decision making have often included only community dwelling, well, older minority adults rather than those with serious illness actively facing treatment decisions. The absence of prospective, longitudinal studies including adequate numbers of seriously ill minority older adults with appropriate measurement of patient, provider, and health system or organizational variables does not allow for a full exploration of factors that may contribute to racial disparities or provide an evidence base for the design of effective interventions.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Priorities for Future Research", "text": "Research on health care disparities includes three phases: detecting differences in health and health care, understanding the determinants that underlie disparities, and intervening to eliminate them. 59 Given gaps in current work, efforts to reduce disparities in palliative care for older adults necessitate research in all of these phases.

The success of this work will depend on the ability and commitment of palliative care researchers to recruit racial and ethnic minority study participants. This is especially challenging considering the difficulty of enrolling seriously ill patients in research in general, and the lower rates of re-search participation among minorities.

Additionally, because of variation in the presence and extent of disparities, similar analyses of smaller populations of racially and ethnically diverse older adults within a common region, health system, state, or community are also useful for identifying best practices (no disparities) and targeting areas for intervention (large disparities). This work should move beyond simply documenting disparities in utilization to examining disparities in quality-that is, determining whether there are equally favorable outcomes for all older adults who access palliative care.

These studies should also consider the context in which palliative care is provided, including setting of care, regional factors associated with treatment intensity (e.g., supply of other health care resources), health care policies and models for providing palliative care. With an eye towards intervening to improve the delivery of palliative care for minority older adults of all racial and ethnic groups, research in this area should rigorously examine those factors that may be most amenable to change via well-designed interventions (i.e., health literacy, communication skills, models of care).", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Eliminating disparities", "text": "The ultimate goal of research in health care disparities is to reduce or eliminate them. Ideally, the work proposed above in understanding modifiable factors associated with disparities in palliative care should inform areas for intervention. One important priority in this area is to develop and test models of care that accommodate a range of cultural beliefs and values and integrate palliative care across the continuum of care. Rather than supporting a narrow approach to the provision of palliative care (e.g., care focused on either cure or comfort), these models should consider the varied needs and preferences of older adults across and within racial and ethnic groups. Other research priorities include the development and testing of interventions based on existing and evolving evidence in the field and successful interventions in other areas of health care disparities, targeting patients, providers, organizations, health systems, and policy. 58 Examples include efforts to increase patient knowledge about palliative care, improve health literacy, address language barriers for specific groups of older minorities, improve provider communication skills, and promote community-based partnerships with stakeholders and leaders in minority communities while increasing access to resources to support the delivery of palliative care (e.g., availability of pain meds). These studies should move towards measuring the effect of the interventions at reducing disparities and improving the quality of care, not just intermediate outcomes such as improved knowledge or skills.\nAlthough reducing and eliminating disparities is an important priority, improving the care of seriously ill older adults requires that we not only examine differences in utilization and quality between racial and ethnic groups but that we also examine outcomes within groups. Even in the absence of disparities, interventions are needed to improve care when outcomes are similarly poor for whites and minorities, such as similarly low rates of hospice enrollment for whites and African Americans in a common geographic area. Models of care that demonstrate favorable outcomes across racial and ethnic groups should be tapped for their ability to serve as best practices. Where outcomes are poor for one group and not another, interventions should target that group. 61 Finally, work to eliminate disparities cannot end with developing and testing interventions in the context of rigorous research designs, but must move to implementing interventions in real-life settings and communities, evaluating their effectiveness, and refining them to meet the needs of their target group.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Existing research documents disparities in palliative care for minorities living with serious illness; however, there are significant gaps in content and methodological limitations in the current body of work.

Models integrating palliative care (PC) into HF care have been proposed, but limited research is available on the outcomes of such models. Objective: Our aim was to assess if inpatient PC for HF patients is associated with improvements in symptom burden, depressive symptoms, QOL, or differential use of services. Methods: Patients hospitalized with acute HF were randomized to receive a PC consult with follow-up as determined by provider or standard care. Two hundred thirty-two patients (116 intervention/116 control) from a large tertiary-care urban hospital were recruited over a 10-month period. Primary outcomes were symptom burden, depressive symptoms, and QOL measured at baseline, 1, and 3 months. Secondary outcomes included advance care planning (ACP), inpatient 30-day readmission, hospice use, and death. Results: Improvements were greater at both 1 and 3 months in the intervention group for primary outcome summary measures after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status differences between study groups. QOL scores increased by 12.92 points in the intervention and 8 points in the control group at 1 month (difference + 4.92, p < 0.001). Improvement in symptom burden was 8.39 in the intervention group and 4.7 in the control group at 1 month ( + 3.69, p < 0.001).

[1][2][3][4][5][6] Prior research has documented both high levels of depression among HF patients as well as low levels of treatment for depression. [7][8][9] HF also has high mortality, with a lower 5-year survival rate than many cancers. 10 Some estimates indicate 50% of people with HF will die within 5 years of diagnosis, 11 and one study estimated a 36% death rate within 1 year after a HF-related hospitalization. 12 HF prevalence has been increasing 11 and is projected to increase 25% from 2010 to 2030. 13 The field of palliative care (PC) may be well suited to address the needs of HF patients. PC assesses and treats psychological distress and pain and other physical symptoms, and it supports functional status, communicates about care goals, and provides support for complex decision making. 14,15 PC has been demonstrated to improve symptom burden, depression, and QOL among patients with cancer. 16,17 PC can also facilitate discussions about treatment preferences for end-of-life care that often remain unaddressed. 18 Models and guidelines for integrating PC into HF management have been proposed, 7,[18][19][20][21] including recommendations in the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines 22 but studies of their impact on outcomes are needed.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether incorporating PC into inpatient care for HF patients is associated with improvements in health status or use of health services. Specifically, our research questions were: is the provision of PC to HF patients in the inpatient setting associated with 1) differences in QOL, symptom management, or depression? Or is it associated with 2) differences in advance care planning (ACP), 30-day readmission, hospice use, or mortality compared with standard care?", "n_publication_ref": 25, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Setting", "text": "This study took place at Abbott Northwestern Hospital (ANW), a 629-bed tertiary-care facility located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that is part of the Allina Health system of hospitals and clinics.

The ANW inpatient PC team at the time of the study included four physicians board certified in hospice and palliative medicine, two clinical nurse specialists board certified in advanced practice palliative care nursing, a social worker, and a chaplain.

Additionally, patients who had already had a PC order request by their attending physician during the hospital stay were ineligible.\nPotentially eligible patients were identified using reports from the electronic health record (EHR). Eligibility was verified by reviewing patient records and talking with a floor nurse if needed. Patients determined to be eligible were visited by the research nurse who explained the study and enrolled patients who were interested in participating. After enrollment and baseline data collection, patients were immediately randomized to the study group and notified of whether they were in the intervention or control group so they would know whether to expect a visit from a PC provider.\nPower calculations were done to identify a goal sample size using mean baseline values of summary scores from 26 pilot study patients for each of the three study data collection instruments. Calculations assumed an a of 0.05 and 80% power. Results indicated a total sample size of 500 (250 per group) would be sufficient to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.25, which equates to a minimum detectable mean differences between intervention and control groups of 1.5 points in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 6.4 points in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF)\nQuestionnaire, and 3.3 points in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS).\nPatient recruitment began in April 2012 and ended in February 2013.

Of the 116 intervention patients, 4 withdrew from the study at the time the provider came to the room because they changed their mind. An additional 11 intervention patients did not receive the intervention because the PC team was unable to conduct the consultation prior to the patient's discharge. Thus 13% of those initially randomized to the intervention group did not get the intervention. There were 19 deaths during the study period and 14 withdrawals from the study. Most of the withdrawals came in the form of refusals to respond to mailed surveys.

After patients were randomized to the intervention group, an order for PC was immediately entered, and triaged by the PC team with a goal of conducting the PC consult within 24 hours of the order. Providers did an initial consult and then determined whether further appointments were necessary and discussed that with the patient. The study intervention differed from the standard PC process in two ways. First, baseline study measures of symptom burden, depression, and QOL were available to the providers to review at the time of the consultation. Second, the study paid only for the initial PC consultation and any subsequent visits were billed to the patient's insurance as standard care. This information about billing was shared with patients during the consent process. Actions of PC providers during visits generally included assessment of symptom burdens; emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial aspects of care; coordination of care orders; recommendations for change in current or future treatment; referrals; and future care planning assessment and discussions.\nThe comprehensive ACP process examined as an outcome was not conducted by the PC providers but may have been introduced and encouraged as part of the PC consult. All HF patients receive a referral to the ACP process through their discharge orders. Those who had not completed the process received a call postdischarge offering the ACP process. The ACP process, described in detail elsewhere, 23 is often referred to as disease-specific ACP. This version of ACP uses a trained facilitator to guide communication between patients and their caregivers regarding patient values and goals for treatment in specific scenarios related to progression of their disease. The process usually takes place in their home with their family members who may serve as proxies for future health care decisions.

Baseline self-reported measures were collected by the research nurse at the time of enrollment either by allowing the patient to complete the questionnaires themselves or by reading aloud the questions to the patient and completing the forms depending on patient preferences. The same questionnaires were administered via mailed surveys at 1 and 3 months after enrollment. Patients who did not return mailed surveys within a week after the 1-or 3-month follow-up date were called by the research nurse and encouraged to return the survey or were offered the option to complete the survey over the phone. Up to three follow-up phone calls were made.\nEHR data were extracted after the study was complete. Each participant had an order indicating study participation and randomization outcome.

The ESAS 24 was created to assess symptoms of patients receiving PC. The ESAS rates ten symptoms (pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well-being, shortness of breath, and ''other'') using a visual scale line with labels of ''none'' at 0 and ''worst possible'' at 10. The scores from each of the first nine items are combined to create a summary distress score. The instrument showed positive results for internal consistency, criterion, and concurrent validity as well as test-retest correlation at 1 day. 24,25 The ESAS is recommended for use with HF patients. 19 The PHQ-9 is a brief, validated instrument used widely in clinical and research settings to assess risk for depression. 26,27 The PHQ-9 has been used in research on HF patients. 28,29 PHQ-9 questions address the previous 2 weeks and ask about physical and mood symptoms of depression that align with diagnostic criteria. Responses indicate how often symptoms were experience and each item is scored from 0 (''not at all'') to 3 (''every day or nearly every day'').\nThe MLHF Questionnaire 30 was created to be representative of the ways HF and treatments can affect key physical, emotional, social, and mental dimensions of QOL. The instrument has high reliability for repeated measures, internal consistency, and high reliability between in-person and telephone data collection. [30][31][32] The MLHF contains 21 items that assess how much a person's HF has affected many aspects of their life during the prior month. Responses range from 0 (''no'') to 5 (''very much''). In addition to a summary score, the instrument has physical dimension and emotional dimension scores.\nFor all three instruments and individual components of the instruments, we calculated change from baseline to 1 month and baseline to 3 months by subtracting the follow-up value from the baseline value. For all of the instruments we used, a higher number is an indication of worse severity in the measure. A positive value for the calculated change from baseline indicates an improvement in that measure since baseline while a negative value in the change measure would indicate a worsening in the severity of that measure.\nReadmissions were defined as an inpatient readmission for any cause within 30 days; hospice use was any hospice admission within 6 months. ACP was defined as documented completion of the disease-specific ACP process in the record within 6 months of the study hospitalization.\nData extracted from the EHR included patient characteristics (age, gender, race, marital status, prior recent hospitalizations as a measure of disease severity), measures of the intervention (number of PC visits, date of PC consultation), and secondary outcomes (ACP, readmissions, mortality, and hospice use).

Additionally, there were no differences at baseline between the groups on the three primary outcome summary measures. Individual symptom components from the ESAS were examined as well and the only measure with different baseline results was tiredness, with the mean being 0.8 points higher in the intervention group ( p = 0.03).\nAmong the 101 patients receiving the PC intervention, 80 received 1 visit from the PC team, 13 received the initial consult plus 1 additional visit, and 8 received a total of 3 or more visits. Some patients were referred to receive visits from the team social worker (n = 10) or chaplain (n = 5) in addition to visits from the PC provider.\nOutcomes at 1 and 3 months show larger improvement on all three summary outcomes in the intervention group than the control group after adjustment for age, gender, and marital status (Table 2). The mean change in the intervention group was 3.69 points more than that in the control group on the ESAS Distress score at 1 month and 4.31 points higher at 3 months. Symptoms showing statistically significant improvement include shortness of breath, anxiety, and tiredness at both time periods and pain at 3 months only. Shortness of breath and tiredness had the largest improvement compared with the control group.

Specifically, this study found significant associations with inpatient visits and improvements in summary measures for the three outcomes over a short time period in HF patients.\nThe differences identified in the current study are from an intervention conducted in the context of short lengths of stay in an inpatient setting with many patients receiving only one visit with the PC provider. As such, the significant results at 1 and 3 months are promising for the role of inpatient PC for HF patients. However, it is unclear on how changes of these levels translate into experiences of patients. An improvement of 5 points in the MLHF has been identified as clinically meaningful. 30,33 The 1-month study mean difference of 4.92 approaches this level. A decline of 5 points in the PHQ-9 is considered a clinically meaningful response to treatment for depressed patients. 34 Our study found an increased improvement of 1.42 in the intervention group, which represents all participants regardless of depression status.\nTo date, research on the integration of PC for HF has occurred primarily in outpatient settings [35][36][37] with a few inpatient  studies focused on feasibility. 38,39 One outpatient study 37 reported a 2.9-point greater improvement in the ESAS Distress score in the intervention group at 3 months, which is comparable to the 3.7 point (1 month) and 4.3 point (3 months) improvement observed in our study. The same study demonstrated mean improvement in the PHQ-9 to be 4.4 points higher in the intervention group, which is slightly higher than the 1.4 and 0.7 differences reported here at 1 and 3 months. The baseline averages for the PHQ-9 in the outpatient study were notably higher than ours however (14.2/14.5 versus 8.6/8.1 in the current study). The MLHF improvement in the outpatient study (5.6 points more in intervention) are comparable to the differences of 4.9 at 1 month and 3.1 at 3 months in the current study. The average age of study participants in the outpatient study was 53.6 whereas ours was 73.4, and this stark age difference should be considered when comparing results. However, both studies generally provide evidence that PC visits likely improve symptom burden in either setting.\nIn addition to the role of PC in addressing specific symptoms burdens, PC is well known for eliciting goals of care, and helping patients and their caregivers with complex medical decision making. 14 For HF patients, ACP is one tool to help patients in this process. 23 A referral to ACP is a standard part of the discharge order set for HF patients at this institution but may not be sufficient to result in participation without a discussion about the process. Indeed, results indicate patients in the intervention were more likely to complete the ACP process after discharge, most likely based on discussions about the ACP process and recommendation from the PC provider during the intervention. Completion of the ACP process focuses on enabling proxies to be able to make decisions in alignment with patient preferences and documents more detailed preferences in the medical record than could be done with a typical advance directive. Completion of the ACP process for HF patients is also associated with increased hospice use at the end of life. 23 One of the challenges to implementing the current study was limited PC provider time. This resulted in some patients assigned to the intervention group not receiving a PC consult and also prohibited the study team from incorporating outpatient PC follow-up visits into the intervention. The study was stopped before reaching the desired sample size because of increased referrals to PC as part of usual care in the hospital. Future models may benefit by combining inpatient and outpatient PC. Advantages of outpatient follow-up care include: follow-up on medical orders or referrals started in the inpatient setting, establishing the relationships with patients and families that enable comprehensive ACP, and improved patient contact to assess changes in symptoms. A model that combines inpatient and outpatient PC delivery would build on prior work supporting the association of outpatient PC with improved symptom burden for a variety of conditions. 36,37 ", "n_publication_ref": 13, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "There are several limitations to this study that should be considered when interpreting results. First, by not achieving the original intended sample size of 500 subjects, the study may be underpowered and the randomization process may not have sufficiently distributed patient characteristics evenly between study conditions. We were able to adjust analysis for the characteristics we could measure, but there may be additional differences that we were not able to measure or address in the analysis. Second, the intervention effect may have been attenuated by the patients assigned to PC who did not ultimately receive the intervention, either because they withdrew or because the PC team did not conduct the consult due to work load. Additionally, a subset of control patients (8) received some PC during the study hospitalization. These limitations are the product of conducting research in an applied setting.\nLosses to follow-up resulted from patient withdrawal, death, and nonresponse to the survey. It is unknown how this may have altered outcomes. Additionally, in assessing readmission and hospice use, we were limited to information on readmissions that took place within our health system, were documented by providers within our system, or were identified by the research nurse during follow-up calls. It is possible that patients were admitted to hospitals or hospice care external to our health system, and it is not possible to know whether the distribution of missing information on health services outside our system was evenly distributed across the study conditions.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This study contributes to the growing evidence that PC may improve symptom burden, depressive symptoms, and QOL in HF patients.

Emerging data suggest that home is the desired location of care for children with cancer at end of life. However, one obstacle to enrollment in a pediatric palliative care (PPC) home care program may be fear that distressing symptoms at end of life cannot be adequately managed outside the hospital. Objective: To compare the symptom distress and quality-of-life experience for children who received concurrent end-of-life care from a PPC home care program (PPC/Oncology) with that of those who died without exposure to the PPC program (Oncology). Methods: We conducted a retrospective survey study of a cohort of bereaved parents of children who died of cancer between 2002 and 2008 at a U.S. tertiary pediatric institution. Results: Sixty bereaved parents were surveyed (50% PPC/Oncology). Prevalence of constipation and high distress from fatigue were more common in the PPC/Oncology group; other distressing symptoms were similar between groups, showing room for improvement. Children who received PPC/Oncology were significantly more likely to have fun (70% versus 45%), to experience events that added meaning to life (89% versus 63%), and to die at home (93% versus 20%). Conclusions: This is the first North American study to assess outcomes among children with cancer who received concurrent oncology and palliative home care compared with those who received oncology care alone. Symptom distress experiences were similar in groups. However, children enrolled in a PPC home care program appear to have improved quality of life and are more likely to die at home.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "I n the United States nearly 16,000 children (0-19 years old) are expected to receive a new cancer diagnosis annually, and despite an excellent overall cure rate, approximately 1960 children and adolescents are expected to die of cancer in 2014. 1 Malignant neoplasms remain the leading cause of death by disease beyond infancy. 1 The overwhelming majority of children with advanced cancer suffer from distressing symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and nausea during their end-of-life period. [2][3][4] The field of pediatric palliative care (PPC) aims to provide excellent pain and symptom management as well as psycho-social-spiritual care, regardless of the expected disease trajectory. Integration of PPC services appear to improve outcomes, such as improved pain and symptom management, improved quality of life, fewer emergency room visits, and reduced pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay. [5][6][7][8][9] Data from Europe suggest that PPC home care services provide adequate pain and symptom management when compared with inpatient oncology care alone. Bereaved parents (n = 449) in Sweden who lost a child to a malignancy between 1992 and 1997, reported that home care was comparable to hospital care for access to, and satisfaction with, pain relief and medications for physical symptoms. 10 In Germany, a large majority ( > 87%) of bereaved parents in two cohorts (n = 48 each) rated the quality of end-of-life home care as good or very good. 11,12 In another German study, parents of 43 children (25% diagnosed with cancer) reported that involvement of a PPC home care program led to significant improvements in the children's symptoms, quality of life, and aspects of communication. 5,13 A recent U.S. study reported that when the choice of hospital-or home-based PPC was offered, PPC occurred more frequently at home. 14 Wolfe et al. 4 reported a significant increase in documentation of hospice and end-of-life home care involvement over time for parents who lost a child to a malignancy between 1990 and 1997 (53%) compared with parents who lost a child between 1997 and 2004 (64%). 3,4 Experience in the United States suggests that one obstacle to enrollment of children with advanced cancer into PPC/ hospice home care programs may be the fear that pain and distressing symptoms at end of life cannot be adequately managed at home, resulting in poor child quality of life. To date, there are no studies in the United States comparing the symptom distress and quality-of-life experience of children who received concurrent end-of-life care from a PPC home care program with those who died without concurrent exposure. The primary aim of this study was to compare endof-life pain and symptom management in children with advanced cancer who received care exclusively from a pediatric oncology service with that of those who received concurrent PPC home care services.

To enroll in CHC's home PPC or home hospice program, an order from the child's oncologist was required, the parent(s) and the child must have agreed to receive services, and the family had to live within 30 miles (50 km) from one of two CHC hospital campuses (Minneapolis or St. Paul, Minnesota).\nThe certified pediatric registered nurses provided regularly scheduled visits depending on clinical needs (from several times per day to once per month, on average weekly) and were available 24/7 for home visits. They assessed distressing symptoms, coordinated with prescribing physicians, and offered care coordination, nursing care, and psycho-socialspiritual care. The social workers undertook regular home visits as well as phone contact to provide the entire family with counseling and support while assisting with community resources, as well as bereavement support.

Reported symptom burden and success of pain and symptom management were generally similar between the groups, suggesting that symptom management at home is not inferior to management on an oncology unit. Children who received integrated PPC at home as part of their cancer management plan were more likely to die at home, in keeping with their family's wishes.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) posits that PPC can be provided in tertiary care facilities, community health and hospice centers, and in children's homes. 19 There appears to be a positive correlation between the availability of palliative home care and the number of children dying at home. 3,[20][21][22][23] A recent study revealed that most U.S. free-standing children's hospitals with palliative care programs only offer inpatient services, and most only during the work week. 24 Parents of terminally ill children often wish for home care, 25,26 with some reporting that home death may have promoted better family adjustment and healing. 27,28 This may be related to fewer feelings of helplessness and greater opportunity for family intimacy and privacy in the home setting. Most families regard caring for their dying child at home as a positive experience. 29 However, others have found family relationships to be better when the child died in the hospital. 30 Acknowledging the selfselecting nature of families' choices, this study showed that higher quality of life may be one of the advantages of providing PPC services in the home. A recent review evaluates modalities to improve PPC for hospitalized children. 31 Patients with advanced cancer, their parents, and treating oncologists may believe that an inpatient stay provides better end-of-life pain and symptom management due to the 24/7 round-the-clock access to clinical staff inside a children's hospital. The results of this study suggest that integration of palliative home care may provide pain and distressing symptom control equally well. However, significant room for improvement in pain and symptom management was identified, as parents recalled that the most distressing symptoms were not successfully managed in the majority of children in either group, which adds to the body of literature of potentially inadequate pain and symptom management for children with malignancies during their end-of-life period. [2][3][4] It was beyond the scope of this study to assess symptom management approaches in the cohort; this remains an important area of further investigation. Interestingly, the older the child, the higher the odds that parents described the degree of suffering as ''A great deal/A lot.'' This might be explained by underrating of distressing symptoms in younger children, as observation instead of self-assessment is used in infants and toddlers. Further, there was a trend toward less suffering from pain in the group that received concurrent PPC home services. Importantly, home-based PPC providers hold expertise in pain management, which may explain this difference. 32 Notably, there was a higher prevalence of constipation (but not degree of suffering) as well as a higher degree of suffering from fatigue (but not prevalence) in the PPC/Oncology group. However, the group also receiving PPC home care included more patients with brain tumors compared with the inpatient group. Whether constipation management was more aggressively provided inpatient and/ or there is a difference in prevalence remains unclear. Constipation is a highly prevalent symptom among children with brain tumors, possibly as a treatment side effect 33 or by the tumors secondarily causing an abnormal bowel function. Meeske et al. reported that fatigue in pediatric cancer is more common in patients with brain tumors compared with leukemia. 34 However, further investigation is needed to better explain these differences. 35 Because our study supported the clinical experience that the provision of palliative home care is correlated with improved quality of life in the end-of-life period of children, it appears critically important to discuss preferences regarding the primary location of end-of-life care as early as possible. Data reveal that planning the location of death has been associated with more home deaths compared with those who do not plan. 18 A parental decision to care for their terminally ill child at home involves consideration of medical, psychological, social, and cultural factors together with such practical considerations as the availability of respite care, physician access, and financial resources. 36 Whatever the decision is regarding the primary location of care, families should be reassured that they can change from one option to another and that the primary oncology team will remain closely involved. 29 Overall, a total of 34 (57%) children in our study actually died at home, and the vast majority were in the PPC/Oncology group (n = 28, 93%), corresponding with their wishes, compared with the  Oncology group (n = 6, 20%). Not surprisingly, when asked about decision making and care at the very end of life, such as planning logistics of their child's death, there were differences between the PPC/Oncology group and the Oncology group. When given the choice, it appears most parents prefer their child die at home instead of a hospital setting. Significantly more parents in the PPC/Oncology group said they preferred that their child die at home instead of the hospital than the Oncology group. Interestingly, although 26 children (43%) died in the inpatient setting, only 9 (15%) of these parents preferred that their child died in the hospital. It is unclear given the retrospective nature of this study how involved these families were in planning their child's location of death, but it was interesting that more parents in the PPC/Oncology group (n = 24, 80%) felt involved in the process compared with only 15 (50%) in the Oncology group ( p = 0.08). Planning for death is commonly to be expected among the PPC core domains. Even though this did not reach significance, it is notable and highlights an area for improvement in communication with families during a very difficult time. Potential reasons that a family might not have chosen PPC might include living in a region of the country without PPC home care, difficult or cramped living situations, or not being offered PPC services by oncology services.", "n_publication_ref": 24, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "Limitations of this survey of bereaved parents include recall bias given the retrospective nature of the study and selection bias, given the response rate. Non-English-speaking parents were excluded, making the results potentially less generalizable. In addition, the study may have been underpowered to detect small differences between groups. It is not clear if the responding parents were systematically different from the nonresponders in ways that might have biased our results in either direction.\nMuch is unknown about group allocation and details of care provided within each group. For example, it is unclear whether there was a referral bias toward children with higher symptom burden in the PPC/Oncology group as a result of being perceived by referring physicians as having greater need for home-based PPC services. There were more children with brain tumors in the PPC/Oncology group, which may raise concern for decreased comparability between the groups; however, we used logistic regression to adjust each comparison for age and cancer type (hematological malignancy, brain) and we acknowledge that this may have been due to differences in referral practices to PPC, although we cannot confirm this due to the retrospective nature of the study. A prospective trial would be needed to confirm or reject the preliminary findings in this study.\nBetter understanding about access to PPC/Oncology and decision making regarding which group is involved would be helpful. Further, it is unclear which specific elements of the PPC/Oncology collaboration (e.g., visits from a child life specialist, social worker, or chaplain) led to improved quality-of-life outcomes.

Objective: Comparison of health care utilization and care quality for patients with cancer who died having received early versus late palliative care. Design: Analysis of cancer registry, administrative, and billing databases. Setting/Subjects: Patients with cancer who died having received specialty palliative care consultation. Measurements: Comparing early (more than 90 days prior to death) versus late (less than 90 days prior to death) palliative care, outcome measures included rates of health care utilization and health care costs.

[3][4][5] Over the previous two decades there has been an increase in the overall aggressiveness of medical care in the last month of life. 6 Moreover, there is marked variation in practice patterns with respect to intensity of care at the end of life. 7 Only limited data exist about the quality and intensity of cancer care for patients at the end of life. 8,9 Timely and accurate clinician-patient communication about care preferences is key to the provision of appropriate EOL care. Early discussions and decisions that patients make even many months before their deaths can significantly influence how and where they die. 10,11 Many patients with advanced cancer do not understand that chemotherapy is unlikely to cure their cancer, suggesting that some care choices may be the result of inadequate communication between provider and patient. 12 Evidence suggests that palliative care, when delivered concurrently with usual oncologic care, improves care quality, patient satisfaction, symptom management, and quality of life, while also reducing hospital costs and overall health care spending. 13,14 Such concurrent care can even prolong survival. 15 In light of these findings, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and other professional organizations have called for universal access to and provision of palliative care along with standard oncologic care for patients with advanced cancer to improve the quality of care. 2,[16][17][18][19] Palliative care has been called ''one of the low hanging fruit of oncology quality improvement initiatives.'' 20 In addition to improving clinical outcomes, there is mounting evidence that outpatient palliative care services can reduce the cost of care at the end of life. In a landmark randomized trial looking at the effect of outpatient palliative care in newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer, Temel et al. 15 demonstrated a significant reduction in aggressiveness of medical care at the EOL, prolonged survival, and estimated cost savings overall. [21][22][23] In another randomized trial, home-based palliative care was shown to reduce physician office visits, emergency department visits, hospital and skilled nursing facility days, and resulted in a 45% decrease in total health care costs in a cohort of patients with advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. 24,25 ASCO recommends early integration of palliative and oncologic care both as a means to improve quality and also to reduce the rising costs and improve the value of cancer care at the end of life. 26,27 To improve quality and financial outcomes in high-value cancer care for patients at the end of life, palliative care must pursue appropriate care standards at the right time. Quality indicators of EOL care based on administrative, populationbased data have been established and validated, and include measures of overutilization of aggressive care and underutilization of supportive care services. 28,29 Benchmarks for desirable performance with respect to intensity of care at the end of life have been proposed. 29 ASCO has issued the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) standards for quality oncologic care, including outcomes for the type and intensity of care provided at the end of life for patients dying of cancer. 30 The National Quality Forum (NQF) has endorsed a number of measures for this population including chemotherapy administered in the last 2 weeks of life, more than one emergency department visit in the last 30 days of life, intensive care unit admission in the last 30 days of life, not admitted to hospice, and admitted to hospice for less than 3 days. 31 In the setting of a focus on utilization patterns with implications for global health care costs and burdensome EOL care transitions, 32,33 other key measures include death within 3 days of hospital discharge and inpatient admissions in the last month of life.\nThere are initial data about how the timing or intensity of palliative care affects the quality of medical care at the end of life for patients with advanced cancer. With an analysis of 366 patients, a major comprehensive cancer center in Texas demonstrated an improvement in EOL quality of care and less aggressive care when specialty outpatient palliative care is incorporated early (more than 90 days before death) compared to late (less than 90 days) in the course of disease. 34 A Canadian study of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated that palliative care consultation as well as higher intensity of palliative care were associated with less aggressive care at the end of life. 35 Another Canadian study, using population-based data from 2005-2009, showed palliative care for patients with cancer was associated with reduced costs in the final month of life. 36 These findings must be replicated elsewhere.\nUsing widely accepted measures of care intensity and quality, including NQF-endorsed measures, the purpose of the study presented here was to examine how timing of specialty palliative care consultation (both inpatient and outpatient) was associated with quality outcomes as well as cost of care for patients at the end of life at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer center.", "n_publication_ref": 39, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Data sources", "text": "We analyzed cancer registry and health system claims and administrative data to identify solid tumor patients who received regular cancer care at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and who were known to have died of cancer between January 1, 2010 and May 31, 2012. Regular care was defined as at least two visits with an affiliated oncologist in the final 6 months of life. We used claims data to identify patients who had any contact with UCSF specialty palliative care services (inpatient or outpatient) and to analyze patterns of health care utilization and fiscal outcomes. Patients were categorized according to the timing of initial palliative care contact, with early palliative care defined, as in prior research, 34 as initial contact with specialty palliative care more than 90 days before death, while late palliative care was defined as initial contact within the last 90 days of life. Date of death was determined by the UCSF electronic medical record and cancer registry, and then verified by state death records.\nPatients with hematologic malignancies were not included in our analysis, because these patients had distinctly different patterns of utilization and likely represent a unique population with palliative care needs and referral patterns that differ from solid tumor patients. 37 To assess fiscal outcomes we gathered data on direct costs of all inpatient and outpatient encounters within the UCSF medical system for the decedents included in the study. Direct cost refers to costs that can be traced to or identified with a specific product or service, such as pharmaceuticals or bedside nursing care. These are distinct from indirect costs, which are costs that cannot be traced to a specific product or service, such as utilities and hospital administration. We report findings in terms of direct costs because these are the types of costs that would be most influenced by changes in utilization of health services. For example, direct costs would increase if a patient is transferred from an acute medical bed to an intensive care unit (ICU) bed, but that change in intensity of care would have no effect on indirect costs such as electricity or the cost of running the medical records department. Data on professional fees were not included in the cost data.\nA Microsoft Access Database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) was used to aggregate data extracted from the cancer registry and health system data describing inpatient care, outpatient care, primary and secondary diagnoses, and procedure codes.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Specialty palliative care services", "text": "Outpatient palliative care was available by referral from physicians at the cancer center.

Patients who received early palliative care sought care less frequently in the emergency department, had fewer inpatient admissions, and spent fewer days in the ICU in the final 30 days of life compared to patients who had palliative care late in the course of disease. Early palliative care was associated with lower 30-day mortality, a lower rate of death within 3 days of hospital discharge, and a lower rate of in-hospital death. These findings are reflected in our cost analysis that demonstrates a substantial reduction in both the inpatient and overall direct costs of medical care in the final 6 months of life for patients who received early palliative care. The longer time frame for clinical contact and greater prevalence of multiple contacts in the early palliative care group are likely drivers of the observed differences in EOL care outcomes. In our study, despite early palliative care being delivered primarily in the outpatient setting and with a greater number of palliative care contacts, overall outpatient costs did not differ significantly between the groups.\nOur data demonstrate that specialty palliative care, when delivered earlier in the course of advanced cancer, leads to improved quality of care as well as reduced health care costs. This finding was consistent among all of the quality metrics examined and is reflected in lower rates of acute care utilization during the final month of life. Our findings are consistent with a recent study linking earlier palliative care with costs in the final month of life in Canada, but our study specifically distinguishes outpatient and inpatient palliative care services. 36 Our findings from this northern California cancer center are consistent with the health care utilization data from the prior Texas study, but adds evidence of cost savings. Furthermore, our decedent population was two and one-half times larger than the Texas study, further strengthening the observed results. Access to our institution's integrated cancer registry allowed us to access administrative and billing data that spanned the entirety of patients' cancer care during both inpatient and outpatient visits. The cost data we present is consistent with quality outcomes we observed and further bolsters the finding that early palliative care is associated with less aggressive and less costly acute medical care at the end of life. With early palliative care, although outpatient costs do not increase significantly, inpatient and total costs are reduced.\nIt is important to recognize that reductions in the cost of care are a byproduct of improvements in the quality of care. Specialist palliative care offered in a variety of settings has been shown to improve outcomes for people with serious illness and their families. Oftentimes improved outcomes (i.e., better symptom control, more clarity on goals of care) manifest as avoided health crises, increased capacity to receive care safely in the home, and improved planning, with the secondary effects of reduced use of some particularly costly health services (hospital admissions, emergency department visits) and increased use of other types of services (home-based care and hospice care.) These changes in type and setting of care result in lower overall health care costs.\nIn the present study, the vast majority of early palliative care encounters occurred in the outpatient setting whereas relatively few occurred during inpatient visits. Given the clinical benefits of early versus late palliative care, it seems reasonable to conclude that early palliative care is best delivered in the outpatient setting while patients are less acutely ill and farther out from a worsening of their cancer and subsequent clinical deterioration. Current evidence suggests that outpatient palliative care is available in only 59% of NCI-designated cancer centers and in only 22% of non-NCIdesignated cancer centers. 39 In light of ASCO recommendations that all patients with advanced cancer have early palliative care integrated with oncologic care, and the Commission on Cancer's requirement that palliative care be available to patients with cancer, there is an urgent need to direct resources toward the establishment and growth of outpatient palliative care programs.\nClinical capacity, however, is not the only issue. Our findings document that palliative care is underutilized at our institution, with only one-third of decedents having contact with palliative care during the course of their disease despite ASCO guidelines. Furthermore, of the patients in the late palliative care group, the majority had multiple clinic visits during months 4-6 prior to death, suggesting that it was not necessarily lack of potential access to palliative care services at our institution, but rather late clinician referral, that was the first barrier to earlier contact with specialty palliative care. 39 The present study has several limitations. Clearly, the measures reported in our database and available for analysis do not fully represent all of what patients and families experience as quality of care. Process measures and chemotherapy at the end of life, for example, are not part of this study. Prior SMS and palliative care outcome studies have reported on numerous other elements of quality care. 13,38 Related analyses from the inpatient setting specifically have been published. 40 The present research is based on data from a single California academic institution, however, our results are in agreement with the prior Texas study. Our study was retrospective and thus susceptible to confounding, historical trends, and changes in practice over time. Furthermore, there was no comparison group available in this study. The large group of patients in our study that had no contact with palliative care-approximately 70% of patients who met inclusion criteria-was heterogenous and had inconsistent patterns of utilization. There were possibly decedents included in our study who in reality did not truly get most of their regular cancer care at our institution. If these patients were treated primarily at outside institutions, data on the intensity of care delivered at the end of life would not be included in the present study. It is possible that delays in updating our cancer registry also led to some decedents being excluded from our study because their cause of death could not be confirmed as having been due to cancer. While referral to hospice within 3 days of death is considered a poor quality outcome by the NQF, the data in our registry were insufficient to assess this outcome. Our baseline demographic data were limited. The cause for greater palliative care referral of gynecologic and urologic cancers in our population is unknown, but is consistent with historical referral patterns based on the process for rolling out palliative care services at our cancer center.\nDespite the limitations of our study, our results are consistent with a growing body of literature that demonstrates a quality and fiscal benefit to the integration of specialty palliative care earlier in the course of cancer care. To examine this relation further, next steps should include randomization of patients to specialty palliative care at various stages in the course of illness to assess for the ideal timing of palliative care concurrent with oncologic care.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Early referral to specialty palliative care is associated with less intensive medical care, improved quality outcomes, and cost savings at the end of life for patients with cancer.

To ensure the most accurate and complete representation of hospital palliative care in the United States we completed a new multistep process. We began by identifying all hospitals that participated in the National Palliative Care Registry. We queried the registry for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for all registrants reporting a palliative care program and crossmatched these hospitals to the AHA survey. Hospitals that were not contained within the National Palliative Care Registry underwent a web search to identify the presence of a palliative care program. A hospital was considered to have a palliative care program if the hospital website listed palliative care under ''Services,'' displayed a palliative care program page, or referred to palliative care programs/teams on a health system or hospital webpage.\nFinally, remaining hospitals without evidence of a palliative care program either from the National Palliative Care Registry or through our web search were contacted by telephone by a trained interviewer. The interviewer contacted the main hospital number and asked to be connected to the palliative care department or division. If the interviewer could not make contact with a palliative care program, they also contacted the following departments (if present) to query as to the presence of a palliative care program: nursing administration, case management, geriatrics, oncology, pain management, spiritual services, hospice, or the office of the chief nursing officer. Contact with a palliative care team member or confirmation from the aforementioned departments resulted in a ''Yes'' for a palliative care program for that hospital. No contact or denial of a palliative care program resulted in a ''No.'' Telephone and web searches were conducted from June 2014 through February 2015.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Analyses", "text": "As in our two most recent reports, 4,5 states were assigned a letter grade based on the percentage of hospitals within the state reporting palliative care programs.

Nevertheless access to palliative care remains uneven and continues to depend on accidents of geography, hospital size, and hospital ownership. One-third of U.S. hospitals report no palliative care services of any kind, and access to palliative care in community settings (home, nursing home, assisted living) is limited for people who are not hospice-eligible. Additionally, the presence of a palliative care program in a hospital does not necessarily mean that seriously ill patients needing palliative care actually receive palliative care services. As a result, most people with serious illness are unlikely to receive the care they need throughout their course of illness. Making palliative care available to the much larger population of the seriously ill who are neither hospitalized nor hospice-eligible is perhaps the single largest opportunity to improve value in in the U.S. health care system. As called for in a recent Institute of Medicine report, 11 opportunities to improve access to palliative care include broad workforce training in the core principles and practices of palliative care; regulatory and accreditation requirements for high-quality palliative care services in health care settings; investment in research to strengthen the quality of care; and development of valid, actionable, and feasible measures of quality of care for this complex and vulnerable patient population.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging (R24AG044300, P30AG028741) and the Cambia Health Foundation.

Objective: The NCP Guidelines are intended to encourage and guide healthcare organizations and clinicians (including nonpalliative care specialists) across the care continuum to integrate palliative care principles and best practices into their routine assessment and care of all seriously ill patients and their family caregivers. Methods: The NCP Guidelines formalize and delineate evidence-based processes and practices for the provision of safe and reliable high-quality palliative care for adults, children, and families with serious illness in all care settings. Results: This article presents the key domains and guidelines of the 4th edition.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "T he 4th edition of the National Consensus Project Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care (NCP) Guidelines expands upon the content in the previous edition, specifically focusing on the two key concepts. First, palliative care is inclusive of all people with serious illness, regardless of setting, diagnosis, prognosis, or age. Second, timely consideration of palliative care is the responsibility of all clinicians and disciplines caring for the seriously ill, including primary care practices, specialist care practices (e.g., oncology or neurology), hospitalists, nursing home staff, as well as palliative care specialist teams such as hospice, hospital, and community-based palliative care teams.\nIn addition, five key themes were added to each domain:\nThe elements of a comprehensive assessment are described Family caregiver assessment, support, and education are referenced in numerous domains The essential role of care coordination, especially during care transitions, is emphasized Culturally inclusive care is referenced in all the domains and expanded in the cultural aspects of care domain Communication (within the palliative care team, with patients and families, with other clinicians, and with community resource providers) is prerequisite for delivery of quality care for the seriously ill and is emphasized throughout", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Settings of Care", "text": "Since palliative care is not setting-specific, palliative care principles and practices are applicable throughout the course of a serious illness, across and between care settings, thereby improving continuity and coordination of care and, as a consequence, decreasing expenses related to duplicative or nonbeneficial interventions or waste.\nWhile hospital-based palliative care and hospice are widely available in the United States, access to palliative care in other settings is often unavailable. Reliable access to palliative care in community-based settings is essential to the delivery of expert care and pain and symptom management, as well as psychological, practical, and social support, helping patients and families remain safely in their care setting of choice.\nNew community-based palliative care models are meeting the needs of those with a serious illness who are neither hospitalized nor hospice-eligible, through provision of care in patient homes, physician offices/clinics, cancer centers, dialysis units, assisted and long-term care facilities, and other community settings. Community-based palliative care services are delivered by clinicians in primary care and specialty care practices (such as oncologists), as well as home-based medical practices, private companies, home health agencies, hospices, and health systems.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Using the NCP Guidelines", "text": "The NCP Guidelines delineate palliative care principles that all clinicians should integrate into the care of seriously ill patients and their families. New, emerging, and established specialist palliative care teams can use the NCP Guidelines to expand services to new patient populations or care settings, form new partnerships, and improve the care provided to patients and families. Primary palliative care providers can integrate the knowledge and skills within the criteria, as well as the specific strategies outlined in the Application to Primary Palliative Care section of each domain. The NCP Guidelines can be utilized to design new palliative care programs, develop and refine educational programs, measure the effectiveness of and improve care, develop payer contracts, shape research, and prepare for healthcare accreditation.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care", "text": "The following are a summary of the domains and brief comments on the clinical implications of each domain.  tions. Care is coordinated and characterized as the right care at the right time throughout the course of an individual's disease(s) or condition. The IDT recognizes that transitions of care occur within care settings, between care settings, and between care providers. Care transitions are anticipated, planned, and coordinated to ensure that patient goals are achieved.\nGuideline 1.8: Emotional support to the IDT. Providing palliative care to patients with a serious illness and their families has an emotional impact, therefore the IDT creates an environment of resilience, self-care, and mutual support.\nGuideline 1.9: Continuous quality improvement. In its commitment to continuous quality improvement, the IDT develops, implements, and maintains a data-driven process focused on patient-and family-centered outcomes using established quality improvement methodologies.\nGuideline 1.10: Stability, sustainability, and growth.\nRecognizing limitations in reimbursement for interdisciplinary palliative care, IDTs endeavor to secure funding for long-term sustainability and growth.\nClinical implications. Across patient populations and care settings from diagnosis to end of life, palliative care can prevent and relieve suffering and optimize quality of life for patients and families. Well-trained and well-supported IDTs perform comprehensive assessments and develop and implement palliative care plans in coordination with the patient, family, and other healthcare and community providers, respecting patient and family values, culture, preferences, and goals. Physical care of seriously ill patients begins with an understanding of the patient goals in the context of their physical, functional, emotional, and spiritual well-being. The assessment and care plan focus on relieving symptoms and improving or maintaining functional status and quality of life. The management of symptoms encompasses pharmacological, nonpharmacological, interventional, behavioral, and complementary treatments. Physical care, acute and chronic symptom management across all care settings, is accomplished through communication, collaboration, and coordination between all professionals involved in the patients' care, including primary and specialty care providers.\nGuideline 2.1: Global. The palliative care IDT endeavors to relieve suffering and improve quality of life, as defined by the patient and family, through the safe and timely reduction of the physical symptoms and functional impairment associated with serious illness.\nGuideline 2.2: Screening and assessment. The IDT assesses physical symptoms and their impact on well-being, quality of life, and functional status.\nGuideline 2.3: Treatment. Interdisciplinary care plans to address physical symptoms, maximize functional status, and enhance quality of life are developed in the context of the patient's goals of care, disease, prognosis, functional limitations, culture, and care setting. An essential component of palliative care is ongoing management of physical symptoms, anticipating changes in health status, and monitoring of potential risk factors associated with the disease and side effects due to treatment regimens.\nGuideline 2.4: Ongoing care. The palliative care team provides written and verbal recommendations for monitoring and managing physical symptoms.\nClinical implications. In all care settings, palliative care seeks to improve physical comfort, quality of life, and optimal functional status. Physical concerns, including ongoing access to medications, can be exacerbated as patients transfer across settings of care. Expert symptom management focuses on physical, emotional, spiritual, religious, and cultural factors, as well as the patient's and family's goals, needs, culture, ages, and developmental status. The palliative care IDT systematically addresses psychological and psychiatric aspects of care in the context of serious illness. IDTs conduct comprehensive developmentally and culturally sensitive mental status screenings of seriously ill patients. The social worker facilitates mental health assessment and treatment in all care settings, either directly, in consultation, or through referral to specialist level psychological and/or psychiatric care. The IDT communicates to the patient and family the implications of psychological and psychiatric aspects of care in establishing goals of care and developing a treatment plan, addressing family conflict, delivering grief support and resources from the point of diagnosis onward, and providing referrals for patients or family members who require additional support.\nGuideline 3.1: Global. The IDT includes a social worker with the ability and skillset to assess and support mental health issues, provide emotional support, and address emotional distress and quality of life for patients and families experiencing the expected responses to serious illness. The IDT has the training and skills to assess and support those with mental health disorders, either directly, in consultation, or through referral to specialist level psychological and/or psychiatric care.\nGuideline 3.2: Screening and assessment. The IDT screens for and assesses psychological and psychiatric aspects of care based upon the best available evidence to maximize patient and family coping and quality of life.\nGuideline 3.3: Treatment. The IDT manages and/or supports psychological and psychiatric aspects of patient and family care, including emotional or existential distress, related to the experience of serious illness, as well as identified mental health disorders. Psychological and psychiatric services are provided either directly, in consultation, or through referral to other providers.\nGuideline 3.4: Ongoing care. The IDT provides recommendations for monitoring and managing long-term and emerging psychological responses and mental health concerns.\nClinical implications. Palliative care teams rely on social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists to ensure that all patients and families have access to treatments that are evidence-based and provided in accordance with their values, assessed needs, and goals of care. Education related to assessment and treatment of psychological and psychiatric aspects of care, including substance use disorder, is an essential element of quality palliative care as are grief assessments and services.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Domain 4: Social aspects of care", "text": "Social determinants of health, hereafter encompassed in the term ''social factors,'' have a strong and sometimes overriding influence on patients with a serious illness. Palliative care addresses environmental and social factors that affect patient and family functioning and quality of life. The palliative care IDT partners with the patient and family to identify and support their strengths and to address areas of need. The IDT includes a professional social worker to maximize patient functional capacity and achieve patient and family goals.\nGuideline 4.1: Global. The palliative care IDT has the skills and resources to identify and address, either directly or in collaboration with other service providers, the social factors that affect patient and family quality of life and wellbeing.\nGuideline 4.2: Screening and assessment. The IDT screens for and assesses patient and family social supports, social relationships, resources, and care environment based on the best available evidence to maximize coping and quality of life.\nGuideline 4.3: Treatment. In partnership with the patient, family, and other providers, the IDT develops a care plan for social services and supports in alignment with the patient's condition, goals, social environment, culture, and setting to maximize patient and family coping and quality of life across all care settings.\nGuideline 4.4: Ongoing care. A palliative care plan addresses the ongoing social aspects of patient and family care, in alignment with their goals and provides recommendations to all clinicians involved in ongoing care.\nClinical implications. The palliative care IDT assesses the social and environmental strengths and vulnerabilities of patients and families to determine their ability to cope with serious illness and maximize quality of life. The IDT plans for, arranges, and coordinates services and supports to address patient and family social and functional goals that enable the patient to remain in the setting of their choice, to the extent possible. The IDT incorporates specialists in social aspects of care specific to the cultural and developmental needs of each patient. Spirituality is recognized as a fundamental aspect of compassionate, patient-and family-centered palliative care. It is a dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity, through which individuals seek meaning, purpose, and transcendence and experience relationship to self, family, others, community, society, and the significant or sacred. Spirituality is expressed through beliefs, values, traditions, and practices. The palliative care IDT serves each patient and family in a manner that respects their spiritual beliefs and practices and is also respectful when patients and families decline to discuss their beliefs or accept spiritual support. Assessing and respecting values, beliefs, and traditions related to health, illness, family caregiver roles, and decisionmaking are the first step in providing culturally sensitive palliative care. Palliative care IDT members continually expand awareness of their own biases and perceptions about race, ethnicity, gender identity and gender expression, sexual orientation, immigration and refugee status, social class, religion, spirituality, physical appearance, and abilities. Information gathered through a comprehensive assessment is used to develop a care plan that incorporates culturally sensitive resources and strategies to meet the needs of patients and family members. Respectful acknowledgment of and culturally sensitive support for patient and family grieving practices are provided. Guideline 6.1: Global. The IDT delivers care that respects patient and family cultural beliefs, values, traditional practices, language, and communication preferences and builds upon the unique strengths of the patient and family. Each member of the IDT works to increase awareness of their own biases and seeks opportunities to learn about the provision of culturally sensitive care. The care team ensures that its environment, policies, procedures, and practices are culturally respectful. Guideline 6.2: Communication and language. The IDT ensures that patient and family preferred language and style of communication are supported and facilitated in all interactions.\nGuideline 6.3: Screening and assessment. The IDT uses evidence-based practices when screening and assessing patient and family cultural preferences regarding healthcare practices, customs, beliefs and values, level of health literacy, and preferred language. Guideline 6.4: Treatment. A culturally sensitive plan of care is developed and discussed with the patient and/or family. This plan reflects the degree to which patients and families wish to be included as partners in decision-making regarding their care. When hosting meetings to discuss and develop the plan, the program ensures that patient and family linguistic needs are met.\nClinical implications. For patients and family members to receive culturally sensitive care, it is incumbent on professionals to continually explore their own biases, work to avoid judgment, and seek frequent training to enhance and strengthen their cultural assessment, treatment, and communication skills. This domain highlights the care provided to the patient and their family near the end of life, with a particular emphasis on the days leading up to and just after the death of the patient. The meticulous and comprehensive assessment and management of pain and other physical symptoms, as well as social, spiritual, psychological, and cultural aspects of care, are critically important as the patient nears death. It is essential that the IDT ensures reliable access and attention in the days before death and provides developmentally appropriate education to the patient, family, and/or other caregivers about what to expect near death, as well as immediately following the patient's death.\nThe interdisciplinary model of hospice care is recognized conceptually and philosophically as the best care for patients nearing the end of life. Discussion regarding hospice as an option for support should be introduced early so that patients and families can understand eligibility and the benefits and limitations of accessing this care model. Early access to hospice support should be facilitated whenever possible to optimize care outcomes for the patient and the family. Palliative care teams, hospice providers, and other healthcare organizations must work together to find innovative, sustainable supportive care solutions for all patients and families in their final months of life.\nGuideline 7.1: Interdisciplinary team. The IDT includes professionals with training in end-of-life care, including assessment and management of symptoms, communicating with patients and families about signs and symptoms of approaching death, transitions of care, and grief and bereavement. The IDT has established structures and processes to ensure appropriate care for patients and families when the end of life is imminent.\nGuideline 7.2: Screening and assessment. The IDT assesses physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs as well as patient and family preferences for setting of care, treatment decisions, and wishes during and immediately following death. Discussions with the family focus on honoring patient wishes and attending to family fears and concerns about the end of life. The IDT prepares and supports family caregivers throughout the dying process, taking into account the spiritual and cultural background and preferences of the patient and family.\nGuideline 7.3: Treatment before death. In collaboration with the patient and family and other clinicians, the IDT develops, implements, and updates as needed a care plan to anticipate, prevent, and treat physical, psychological, social, and spiritual symptoms. The care plan addresses the focus on end-of-life care and treatments to meet the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of patients and families. All treatments are provided in a culturally and developmentally appropriate manner. Postdeath care is delivered in a manner that honors patient and family cultural and spiritual beliefs, values, and practices.\nGuideline 7.5: Bereavement. Bereavement support is available to the family and care team, either directly or through referral. The IDT identifies or provides resources, including grief counseling, spiritual support, or peer support, specific to the assessed needs. Prepared in advance of the patient's death, the bereavement care plan is activated after the death of the patient and addresses immediate and longerterm needs.\nClinical implications. While the IDT may follow a patient in palliative care from diagnosis to end of life, additional clinical skills help to identify signs and symptoms of approaching death. Discussions about, and referral to, hospice are offered as early as possible. The IDT must assess fears, address concerns, provide caregiver training, and support the family through the dying process and postdeath. It is essential that the IDT attends to patient and family cultural and spiritual beliefs, values, and practices to promote a peaceful, dignified, and respectful death, in all settings of care. The palliative care IDT applies ethical principles to the care of patients with serious illness, including honoring patient preferences as well as decisions made by legal proxies or surrogate decision makers. It is important to note that in all cases, surrogates' obligations are to represent the patient's preferences or best interests. Familiarity with local and state laws is needed relating to advance care planning, decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments, and evolving treatments with legal ramifications (e.g., medical marijuana), especially when caring for vulnerable populations, such as minors, prisoners, or those with developmental disability or psychiatric illness.\nGuideline 8.1: Global. The core ethical principles of autonomy, substituted judgment, beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence underpin the provision of palliative care.\nGuideline 8.2: Legal considerations. The provision of palliative care occurs in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations and laws as well as current accepted standards of care and professional practice.\nGuideline 8.3: Screening and assessment. The patient's preferences and goals for medical care are elicited using core ethical principles and documented.\nGuideline 8.4: Treatment and ongoing decision making. Within the limits of applicable state and federal laws, current accepted standards of medical care, and professional standards of practice, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments.\nClinical implications. Ethical and legal principles are inherent to the provision of palliative care to patients with serious illness, including principles of self-determination, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Clinicians understand ethical principles underlying healthcare delivery in the context of their own professional practice setting and discipline, as well as the laws and statues governing healthcare. In all contexts, the IDT provides attention to moral agency and emphasis on collaborative practice. The IDT is mindful of its own values and beliefs when facilitating informed decision-making and participating in ethical dilemma resolution and recognizes the importance of maintaining professional boundaries across all settings and contexts, regardless of patient age.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "The NCP Guidelines, 4th edition, will advance the field of palliative care.

Palliative care begins with a comprehensive assessment and emphasizes patient and family engagement, communication, care coordination, and continuity of care across healthcare settings. Guideline 1.1: Interdisciplinary team. Since palliative care is holistic in nature, it is provided by a team of physi-cians, advanced practice registered nurses, physician assis-tants, nurses, social workers, and chaplains. The palliative care team works with other clinicians and community service providers supporting continuity of care throughout the illness trajectory and across all settings, especially during transitions of care.
